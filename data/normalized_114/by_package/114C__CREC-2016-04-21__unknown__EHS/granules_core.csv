Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I represent a rural district in northern California where many of my constituents can only access the Internet through dial-up or low-speed DSL. Lack of access to broadband in rural areas is a drag on economic growth and impacts our small businesses, schools, hospitals, and much more. Recently, the House took action to ensure the FCC cannot regulate the rates charged for broadband Internet access by passing H.R. 2666. There is no regulatory scheme the FCC can create that will magically solve the challenge of expanding broadband access in high-cost areas. Instead, likely, it will be a hindrance as it creates more barriers to that access. Expanding broadband in rural areas requires an understanding of the economic realities, recognizing the need for greater access, and removing the regulatory uncertainty. Adoption of H.R. 2666 will encourage investment by letting Internet service providers know they will not have to face the threat of Federal regulations on the rates they charge and continue the push for broadband access and investment in rural areas, which will be very helpful for people who have to drive a long distance for education and the telemedicine that is so critical in rural areas. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [House] [Page H1899] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, whether you are a mayor, a city council member, or a Member of Congress, it is the job of all elected officials to be problem solvers for the families we serve. For almost 25 years, the city of Galesburg has had a problem. The majority of water tests there have had lead content exceeding the Federal action level, and the most recent health report shows that more than 14 percent of children tested in Knox County had high lead levels in their small bodies. When there is a problem, especially a serious problem like this, leaders come together to solve it. They don't point fingers, and they certainly do not deny facts.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 688, I call up the bill (H.R. 3724) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prohibit the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service from rehiring any employee of the Internal Revenue Service who was involuntarily separated from service for misconduct, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). Pursuant to House Resolution 688, in lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means, printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-48, is adopted and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: H.R. 3724 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON REHIRING ANY EMPLOYEE OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE WHO WAS INVOLUNTARILY SEPARATED FROM SERVICE FOR MISCONDUCT. (a) In General.--Section 7804 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: ``(d) Prohibition on Rehiring Employees Involuntarily Separated.--The Commissioner may not employ any individual previously employed by the Commissioner who was removed for misconduct under this subchapter or chapter 43 or chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, or whose employment was terminated under section 1203 of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (26 U.S.C. 7804 note).''. (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply with respect to any employee removed from employment before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 3.

Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from South Dakota. General Leave Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to [[Page H1901]] revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 3724, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from North Dakota? There was no objection. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan bill, H.R. 3724, Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act. With tax day just behind us, most Americans have finished their tax returns. They filled out form after form, giving the IRS some of the most sensitive information possible, including their Social Security numbers, their birth dates, wage data, and more. In 2014, the inspector general for the IRS released a report that raised serious questions about whose hands this information falls into once it arrives at the IRS. More specifically, an audit of the agency's hiring practices found that the IRS rehired hundreds of former employees whom the IRS had previously fired because of conduct problems. And we are not talking about small infractions. The IRS rehired employees who had falsified documents. They failed to pay their own taxes. They accessed sensitive taxpayer information without permission. To think that someone could inappropriately access tax information, get fired for doing so, and then be rehired just a few months later is completely unacceptable. But it has happened, and it has happened more than once. These stories border on the absurd. One employee had been absent without leave for a total of 8 weeks worth of work. As a result, that employee was fired, and the words ``do not rehire'' were stamped on that personnel file. Still, the IRS rehired that person. IRS leadership has failed to acknowledge its mistakes or change its processes. Instead, they stuck their heads in the sand. According to the inspector general, the IRS' response to the report was that it believed its current process was good enough. Well, I don't buy it, and if the IRS leadership thinks its current processes are protecting taxpayers, they need a reality check. {time} 0915 The Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act is a simple, bipartisan fix to a serious problem. The bill does what the IRS bureaucracy in Washington won't: it stops the IRS from rehiring former employees who had been fired for cause. Now, my staff and I met with numerous frontline IRS employees from South Dakota who are sincere and hardworking individuals. My bill is not aimed at them. This legislation is aimed at the IRS bureaucracy in Washington and is intended to address a very real problem that they have refused to fix. There is no reason that IRS leadership in Washington shouldn't be held to the same standard to which it holds you, the taxpayers. With this legislation, we can hold the IRS accountable to us for its hiring practices and ensure a high-quality workforce for the agency. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, yield myself such time as I may consume. We all agree that the IRS faces serious consumer service challenges and needs to be more responsive to the American taxpayer, but this bill is not a serious attempt at oversight of the IRS. In fact, with respect to making the IRS more responsive to taxpayers, this bill is a move in the wrong direction. But the fact that Republicans are moving in the wrong direction on tax policy really shouldn't be a surprise to any of us. They are not only starving our entire government of the resources that it needs to operate efficiently for the American public, but they are deliberately standing in the way of actual productive policies. Forget real tax reform that would bring positive benefits. They aren't even doing anything to fix what is broken in the system today. For example, the Republicans refuse to crack down on large corporations that seek to avoid paying their fair share of taxes simply by changing their mailing address from the United States to a low-tax foreign country. We see these stories on TV all the time, corporations renouncing their American citizenship to not have to pay any--any--U.S. taxes. But congressional Republicans have refused to take any action to stop these corporate tax dodgers and the resulting offshoring of American jobs. In fact, the Republicans who run Congress have protected these companies not only through their refusal to act to stop these tax inversions, but by also refusing to repeal the tax break that incentivizes U.S. companies to ship jobs overseas. Yes, American companies can claim a tax break for firing American workers and moving their jobs overseas, and my Republican colleagues are doing nothing about that. The real-world effect of the Republicans' refusal to go after these corporations that invert themselves to avoid paying their share of taxes is a heavier tax burden on the rest of our honest constituents who are playing by the rules. To address this problem, the Treasury Department recently issued new rules to stop large corporations from simply changing their post office box to avoid paying U.S. taxes. Could my constituents imagine simply changing their post office box address to eliminate their Federal taxes? Of course not. Because they can't. But somehow multinational companies, which seem to have more rights than American citizens, can. Now, you would think the American Congress would support the efforts of the American President to stop American companies from not paying the taxes here in America. But, Mr. Speaker, you would be wrong. The majority is threatening to stop the Treasury from advancing these types of commonsense rules to make multinational corporations pay their fair share of U.S. taxes just like everyone else. Wouldn't our time be better spent and served if my Republican colleagues held hearings--and passed bills--to stop companies from moving their jobs and profits overseas? Democrats stand ready to work with them to enact commonsense policies to close the loopholes in our Tax Code that encourage companies to send their profits and their jobs overseas. Unfortunately, we will have to wait for another day before the majority is serious about working together to make our tax system fairer for working people. But let me be clear. Americans will not wait any longer. They demand that we act to close these loopholes to ensure that American corporations don't cheat the system to try to avoid paying their fair share of taxes here in the United States, letting the little guy have a greater burden in their absence. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have a gentlemen here to speak on behalf of my bill who has been a strong leader in bringing integrity to the IRS. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith). Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, we are at a crossroads with our tax system. Our Tax Code is outdated, overly complicated, and the IRS has proven that it, in and of itself, is in need of serious reform. Here is an opportunity for us to work together. From the opening remarks of my colleague across the aisle, I am not sure if that is an attitude of cooperation, but certainly this is a bill we can work together on, I would hope. Our Tax Code was last updated in 1986, a generation ago. It is increasingly burdensome in this global 21st century economy. American taxpayers need a simpler code that they can easily comply with. Finally, they deserve an accountable and consistent IRS which provides exceptional taxpayer customer service. It is long past time for the status quo to change on these problems. We need tax reform. This is why I stand in support of my colleague's bill, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act. The legislation would prohibit the IRS from rehiring any individual who was previously employed by the IRS, but fired for cause. This is inconsistent and unacceptable behavior from an agency which requires the highest standard of tax compliance from taxpayers. The IRS should apply the same rigorous standard inside the agency itself. [[Page H1902]] Mr. Speaker, I wish we didn't need an act of Congress such as this, but, apparently, we do. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I have a friend and colleague here today who has fought daily for years for hardworking taxpayers across America and for his home district. I am proud to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Hamlin County, South Dakota, a very dear friend not only of every Member of Congress, but, in particular, a great Representative representing South Dakota at a time when South Dakota needs not only strong representation, but a strong voice. I want to thank the young Congresswoman for bringing this legislation to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, today is quite simple. The United States Congress has a say in the matter about how our government is run and the conduct of the government. The Internal Revenue Service has, for quite some time, been at odds, I believe, not only with their mission statement, but also at odds with their duty to publicly serve, provide information, and to do the things that enable taxpayers, who want to follow the law and need to follow the law, to comply respectfully. The Internal Revenue Service, over the last few years, has run afoul, I believe, of the American people because the commonsense obligations that they have have not been met. Today we are here on the floor with Congresswoman Noem to talk about H.R. 3724 that prohibits the Commissioner of the IRS from rehiring any employee who was involuntarily--that means forced--out or involuntarily separated from service for misconduct at the Internal Revenue Service. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported in February 2015 that the IRS had rehired those employees who had been fired from the Service for misconduct, hundreds of former employees who were terminated for well-documented conduct or performance issues. In fact, the IRS rehired 141 former employees who had substantial tax issues. That means they were not paying their own tax bills. Mr. Speaker, if we were going to hire a person in our office, we would attempt to gain information about that employee. Yesterday, as we were talking about this on the rule, a fellow colleague said: What about your own employees? Do you make sure they pay their taxes? I said: That would be a good question. No, I don't ask that question. But I would not have any idea what the real answer was--the truth--if an employee did not tell me the truth. The IRS does have the answer. They know who is paying their taxes, and they know why they fired an employee, Mr. Speaker. We are here saying that the Internal Revenue Service should not rehire these employees who were unfaithful, unfaithful to their job and unfaithful to the American taxpayer. One hundred forty-one employees who substantially did not pay their taxes represent 60 percent of all terminated for misconduct. I think I know why: because the Internal Revenue Service at the highest levels allows this to go on, and then they rehire the employees who didn't even follow the law. Mr. Speaker, that is not just misconduct. That is another level giving them an opportunity that a normal taxpayer would not have to get away with not paying their own taxes. Other misconduct issues of rehiring employees include accessing taxpayer information improperly without authorization, falsification of official forms, unacceptable behavior and performance, and abuse of IRS leave and property policies while on public time. Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Noem is doing the right thing and so is the House of Representatives. I would like to see this be a bipartisan issue, not a partisan issue. We need the IRS. We need them to do a good job. But if this were at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, would we allow that to happen? If this were at the CIA, would we allow that to happen? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 30 seconds. Mr. SESSIONS. If this were at the Department of Justice, would we allow that to happen? Why is this not a bipartisan issue? Why can't we get together and say: Mr. Koskinen, you are the Commissioner of the IRS. We respectfully would like to see you correct what you are doing. We are not on a witch hunt. We have the facts of the case, and we believe the right thing to do is to offer some remedy. That is why Republicans are on the floor today, and that is why our young Congresswoman is leading this charge. I stand behind her. I voted for the rule, and I am going to vote for this. It does the right thing. I thank the gentlewoman for the time. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, I would just add to that list of the gentleman from Texas: If it were Congress, would we allow this to happen? Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, we have another colleague here on the floor today who serves on the Ways and Means Committee and has diligently worked on IRS issues and has been a leader on bringing some clarity to the situations that we deal with in trying to bring integrity to the IRS. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci). Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2015, a bill sponsored by my good friend and colleague, Representative Kristi Noem of South Dakota. As the previous colleague said, this should be a bipartisan issue. This is an American issue. I spent most of my life in the business world. I have owned and operated over 60 different businesses, employed over 3,000 people, and created thousands of new jobs. Throughout my 30-year business career, I have had the privilege of hiring many new, talented individuals. When it comes to hiring at the IRS, the Treasury inspector general stated, ``Selecting the best candidates for employment is essential to providing the best service to America's taxpayers, maintaining public trust in tax administration, and safeguarding taxpayer's rights and privacy.'' However, the inspector general report from December 2014 found that the IRS fell short of that standard. Last year the IRS hired hundreds of employees who were terminated for misconduct. Those serious offenses included willful failure to file tax returns, unauthorized access to taxpayer information, falsification of official forms, and abuse of IRS leave and property policies. {time} 0930 As a businessman, but more importantly as a representative of the American taxpayer, I find this IG report inexcusable. It seems obvious to me, but not once did I rehire someone in the real world--in the real world--who I had previously fired for misconduct. The IRS needs to earn the trust of hardworking American taxpayers. Rehiring employees who were fired for these serious offenses further erodes that trust. H.R. 3724 directly addresses this issue. It prohibits the IRS from rehiring employees that were fired for misconduct. This is common sense. As a former businessowner, I know it is a very difficult decision to let someone go, but rehiring an individual who was asked to leave due to gross misconduct would be insulting to other employees who have faithfully served the business, and would present a significant risk to the health of the organization and its customers. The IG report found the IRS doesn't take those risks seriously. In fact, ``IRS officials stated that prior conduct and performance issues do not play a significant role in deciding the candidates who are best qualified for hiring.'' Because the IRS hasn't taken [[Page H1903]] those risks seriously, this straightforward, commonsense legislation is needed to restore accountability and trust in the IRS. I would like to commend Mrs. Noem for her leadership on this legislation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, it appears that America will have to continue to wait for action to stop companies from shifting American jobs overseas and stopping corporate tax dodgers. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3724. I would think as we look around the country right now, the integrity of what our government is and how our voters are represented and our citizens are represented, is really the case here. I thank the gentlewoman for bringing such a commonsense piece of legislation forward because we know in this town there is nothing less common than common sense. The faith and trust of the American people is based on their belief that the people who work for them are acting in their best interest, always acting in their best interest--the interest of the American people. Not in their personal interest, but in the interest of the American people. We find out that there are folks who are working on behalf of the American people, but they have somehow betrayed that faith and that trust. And folks have lost confidence in their government. They have lost confidence because of things that happened, not things that were imagined, not some whimsical idea that somehow we can get at somebody for doing this. There is no agency that is feared more in this country than the IRS. The question is: Why would they be so feared? Because they can completely shut you down, they can freeze your bank account, they can make you stay up late at night worrying about what is going to happen. When you get that letter from the IRS, the next thing you do is contact an attorney to represent you because you don't want to make a mistake, you just don't want to do it. But then you find out that within the IRS, people working for that agency, but, more importantly, working for the people of the United States, have violated that trust. These are substantiated results. This is not somebody's idea or way of getting back at somebody. This is removing bad apples and saying: you have violated, you have betrayed the trust of the American people, you are going to leave the agency, but, more importantly, you are never coming back in. This isn't any way to somehow get back at a political party or get back at anybody. This is a fact that if we cannot restore the confidence the American people have in us--their faith and their trust--why are we here? Why do we go through elections? I don't come here to represent my ideas and my beliefs. I come here to represent the values and beliefs of Pennsylvania's Third Congressional District. That is 705,687 Americans, not Republicans, not Democrats, not Libertarians, not Independents, but Americans. This piece of legislation takes into account that these are wrongdoers. These are not people who we want to associate ourselves with. These are people who have used the power of their office or of their position to somehow work against the very people who employ them. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I would just say, at this moment in our history, I thank the gentlewoman for standing up for every hardworking American taxpayer and doing the best we can to restore the faith and confidence of the American people that they can trust who it is that they elect to represent them and they can trust us to make sure that wrongdoers are punished and, once are asked to leave, are not allowed to come back in. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire how much time is remaining on both sides. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 24\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from South Dakota has 15\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz). Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mrs. Noem and her drive to address this very important issue. I believe that the overwhelming majority of the people who work at the IRS are good, hardworking, patriotic people who want to do the right thing. I have a serious problem with management and I have a serious problem with the head of the IRS, but on this issue, this is just unbelievable that we can't come to a conclusive and absolute 100 percent agreement. All we are asking for is that the bad apples, the people who will disturb what is going on in the workplace, who aren't going to act in the best interest of the United States of America, that they be excluded from participation. One of the things that is fascinating, Mr. Speaker, as we look at this, is in response to the independent review that was done of the IRS and their hiring practices. And the question here is: Should we go back and review the personnel employment file prior to rehiring somebody? This is what they said: ``Additionally, while it did find that a review of performance and conduct issues could be accomplished earlier in the process, the Department of Treasury, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Internal Revenue Service believed that it was not feasible to move the review of these issues earlier in the hiring process. This action would greatly increase the cost of hiring, likely increase cycle time beyond the Presidential mandate of 80 days, require additional resources, and not likely yield a reasonable return on investment.'' Come on. Come on. Are you kidding me? How long could it possibly take to actually go back and review somebody's performance reviews, look back at their employment history, and see if they have been acting in the best interest of the United States of America? Clearly, in the examples that are there, there are people that willfully don't even file their own tax returns, there are people that are doing some bad, stupid stuff. They don't think they have the time and resources to look at it in advance; we have to actually pass a piece of legislation requiring this? That seems entirely reasonable. It is not overly burdensome. Here you have an organization, the IRS, that can actually destroy somebody's life by a mere letter showing up in your mailbox, and they can't even take the time to look at somebody's employment history, somebody who has already worked at the IRS? That is how absurd this organization is, and that is why this piece of legislation is so easy to understand, it is so easy to vote for. It is not a partisan issue. This is just saying: Do you know what? For all the good people who work at the IRS, let's make sure that the new people who come on, or the rehires who come on, in this case, are actually addressed and we look at their information prior to hiring. It is that simple. That is why I am in favor of this bill. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds. I am still waiting for a bill to keep American jobs in America and not export them overseas through the Tax Code. I will continue to wait for that bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, today, we are talking about a bill that will bring integrity to the IRS, which will better serve our taxpayers into the future. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise). Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I really want to thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota for her leadership in bringing this bill forward. Mr. Speaker, this bill is about restoring trust. This bill is about holding the IRS accountable. Here we are, in a week where Americans had to file their tax returns. And so often, just the letters I-R-S send a chilling effect through people when they hear those [[Page H1904]] letters. Yet, you look at the arrogance over at the IRS, just the attitude that they have and the disdain it seems that they have towards the very people who pay their bills--the taxpayers. Here you have a case where people who have been fired by the IRS for abusing their positions are actually being rehired back to the IRS. Again, this is the kind of disdain that disgusts people as they fear the IRS. The IRS ought to have the same fear towards the people who pay their salaries as people get when they get that letter from the IRS. Mr. Speaker, we have had inspector general reports in the Treasury Department. The inspector general found over 140 IRS agents aren't even accurate in their taxes. The very people who are responsible for auditing American citizens aren't even paying their own taxes. This is the kind of disregard for the American people that we are seeing over at the IRS, and it is time to rein it in. It is time to bring some accountability and transparency back to the IRS. Who is afraid of that? What is so wrong with saying: If somebody has been fired for cause over at the IRS, with the access they have to such sensitive personal information of taxpayers, why should they be rehired back? It is just basic common sense that if somebody has abused their position at the IRS, enough is enough, and they shouldn't be able to return and have access to that sensitive information anymore. I want to applaud, again, the gentlewoman from South Dakota for bringing this commonsense bill forward. I would urge adoption later on when we have this vote on the House floor. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop). Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my friend from South Dakota for her leadership in holding the IRS accountable for what we are seeing today. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act, to join in the outrage with my colleagues today on what we are seeing at the IRS. With tax day hitting earlier this week, I think this is an ideal time to highlight the need for continued oversight and, perhaps, ramped-up oversight of the Internal Revenue Service. Last February, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported that the IRS had a tendency to rehire former employees with serious misconduct and performance issues. In their review, they found more than 100 former employees were rehired by the IRS despite having significant performance and misconduct problems, like willfully failing to file tax returns: a rather important thing for most of us, but apparently not for IRS employees. Mr. Speaker, the families in my district and I are 100 percent fed up with adhering to a standard that the IRS doesn't even hold their own employees to. We simply will not tolerate the rehiring of incompetent individuals who fail to do their job in the first place. It is time to put a leash on the IRS and prevent taxpayers from further double standards and further abuse. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 3724. Again, I thank my colleague from South Dakota for her excellent leadership on this. I look forward to open debate and voting on this matter as soon as possible. {time} 0945 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. No disrespect to the sponsor of this bill whatsoever. I have great admiration for her, as she knows, but I believe that this bill could have been taken up on the consent calendar, quite frankly, with all of this discussion about the support on both sides. The reality is, though, that we are using precious time here on the floor on an issue that, as I say, could have been on the consent calendar. We are not addressing the real issue of concern to the American people, which is of the continuing loss of jobs here in America because of our Tax Code, which we refuse to fix, that is shifting jobs and American corporations overseas to inversion and also shifting American jobs overseas because of those inversions. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CROWLEY. I yield myself an additional 15 seconds. Mr. Speaker, we are not having a hearing on this. We are not doing anything here on the floor to address this issue. Instead, we are taking up issues that, quite frankly, could have been on the consent calendar. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I am ready to close. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I believe this should be the beginning and not the end of a discussion on how to best plug the giant corporate loopholes that are allowing companies to skip out on paying the same taxes that all of our constituents have to pay. This is one of the many major issues this Congress should undertake; but, instead, we are all too busy governing by press releases. This Congress has done nothing to address the Zika virus, which could be a threat to all women who are pregnant or who are looking to become pregnant; but we have this consent bill here on the floor for debate. This Congress has done nothing to address the crisis of lead in our drinking water--a crisis vividly on display in Flint but one that lurks in the pipes of hundreds of cities and towns across our great land; yet we have this consent bill here on the calendar for debate. This Congress hasn't even attempted to pass a budget for our country--the majority has not proposed a budget for our country--which is one of the most basic functions we can do as an institution to make sure we make the necessary investments possible while also getting our economic house in order; yet we have what I would consider to be a consent calendar bill here on the floor today, taking up an hour's debate. But we will always have time for message bills. Sure, they don't create a job for an unemployed person in New York or in Flint or in Houston or in L.A., and they don't increase the take-home pay of any underpaid worker or make college more affordable for middle class kids or strengthen Social Security for our seniors of today and tomorrow, but they will sound great on talk radio tonight and over the weekend-- we are going after the IRS again. They don't even deal with the Tax Code even though this bill is advertised as the Republicans' idea of tax reform. It does not reform the Tax Code in any way, shape, or form, but that is what they portray it as. Let me explain something about the Tax Code to my Republican colleagues. Our Tax Code is inefficient. You see that when large corporations are paying less tax than the employees who work for them. It is overly complicated. You see that when multinational corporations avoid paying the same taxes as our constituents back home have to pay simply by their hiring expensive lawyers that our constituents, quite frankly, cannot afford. It is unfair. You see that when corporations can dodge paying their fair share of taxes by simply switching their post office boxes to foreign countries--something our neighbors back home, if they attempted to do, would be arrested for, for tax evasion, but not corporations. Individuals, if you do that, you are arrested for tax evasion, but not an American corporation; yet my Republican colleagues continue to refuse to address this issue. Maybe more importantly than anything else, it does not promote job growth here in the United States. You see this when Congress refuses to repeal the tax breaks for companies to fire their workers here and move their jobs overseas. This Congress must tackle these serious issues, but we are not doing that today. We continue to wait for legislation--for a hearing--on these important issues. Democrats stand ready to work with you all, my Republican colleagues, on commonsense legislation that plugs the corporate tax loopholes that are literally draining the funds our country needs in order to function properly. Democrats stand ready to work with you to fix the Tax Code that is not only inefficient, not only complicated, not [[Page H1905]] only unfair, but that does not promote job growth here in the United States. That is something we want to work with you on in a bipartisan way. Unfortunately, we have to continue to wait for another day before the majority is serious about working together, in a bipartisan way, to make our tax system fairer for all working men and women in the United States. Let me be clear, once again, that the American people will not wait any longer. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. We have heard repeatedly from my colleague on the other side of the aisle about why we should not be spending time on this topic today, about why we shouldn't have dedicated an hour's worth of debate to making sure that we talk about H.R. 3724, Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act. I think he has forgotten about what kind of information the people of this country turn over to the IRS. They turn over their Social Security numbers, their financial information; a lot of the security that they have for their families, their homes, and their businesses they completely trust the IRS to take care of, to protect, and to make sure that they use in the correct manner so that they might abide by the law and pay their taxes like honest, hardworking Americans do. To say that we shouldn't spend time in making sure that criminals and people who are fired for misconduct don't have access to that information, to me, is silly. That is exactly what our job is. The IRS needs integrity, and we are here to bring it today. Mr. Speaker, the White House has issued a veto threat against this bill. They said that the IRS would be forced to fire people, because of this bill, if it were signed into law. I read the White House's Statement of Administration Policy on my bill, and the statement reads that it is unnecessary because current IRS processes already ensure that the agency does not rehire former employees who have significant conduct issues. I guess the White House didn't read the report, for the inspector general expressed concerns that the IRS continues to hire individuals who have significant prior conduct and performance issues even after the agency supposedly made upgrades to its hiring practices. I remind you, Mr. Speaker, that the inspector general's review of former employees who were fired for serious misconduct and who were then rehired included employees with histories of fraud, a falsification of documents, workplace disruption, absence, and an unauthorized accessing of taxpayer information. The inspector general identified approximately 140 individuals who are currently, today, with the IRS who had been previously fired for cause. We are talking about an agency that employs 80,000 people. Surely, it can find 140 people who haven't committed fraud or falsified documents. Mr. Speaker, the inspector general recommended that the IRS reassess its hiring practices to determine in what part of the process it should fully vet candidates in terms of their prior performance. In fact, the IRS was given an opportunity to fully respond to the inspector general's report. In its response, the agency insisted its processes were sufficient. Yet, Mr. Speaker, the agency still only begins to vet the candidates for employment only after the entire hiring process is completed and after a formal offer of employment has been extended. So, regardless of any changes the IRS has made to its hiring practices, the inspector general said he remains very concerned because IRS documents indicate it is hiring individuals who have significant prior conduct and performance issues. Mr. Speaker, because the IRS hasn't taken action is why we are here today. This bill is simple. It just says that the IRS cannot rehire employees who have been fired for misconduct. It is something the IRS should have taken action on; and because they didn't, that is why we are here today. It is our job to protect the taxpayers and to make sure their information is safe with the agency that they, by law, need to turn over to the IRS. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 688, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1900-H1905] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENSURING INTEGRITY IN THE IRS WORKFORCE ACT OF 2015 Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 688, I call up the bill (H.R. 3724) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prohibit the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service from rehiring any employee of the Internal Revenue Service who was involuntarily separated from service for misconduct, and ask for its immediate consideration.

The gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from South Dakota. General Leave Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to [[Page H1901]] revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 3724, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from North Dakota? There was no objection. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan bill, H.R. 3724, Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act. With tax day just behind us, most Americans have finished their tax returns. They filled out form after form, giving the IRS some of the most sensitive information possible, including their Social Security numbers, their birth dates, wage data, and more. In 2014, the inspector general for the IRS released a report that raised serious questions about whose hands this information falls into once it arrives at the IRS. More specifically, an audit of the agency's hiring practices found that the IRS rehired hundreds of former employees whom the IRS had previously fired because of conduct problems. And we are not talking about small infractions. The IRS rehired employees who had falsified documents. They failed to pay their own taxes. They accessed sensitive taxpayer information without permission. To think that someone could inappropriately access tax information, get fired for doing so, and then be rehired just a few months later is completely unacceptable. But it has happened, and it has happened more than once. These stories border on the absurd. One employee had been absent without leave for a total of 8 weeks worth of work. As a result, that employee was fired, and the words ``do not rehire'' were stamped on that personnel file. Still, the IRS rehired that person. IRS leadership has failed to acknowledge its mistakes or change its processes. Instead, they stuck their heads in the sand. According to the inspector general, the IRS' response to the report was that it believed its current process was good enough. Well, I don't buy it, and if the IRS leadership thinks its current processes are protecting taxpayers, they need a reality check. {time} 0915 The Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act is a simple, bipartisan fix to a serious problem. The bill does what the IRS bureaucracy in Washington won't: it stops the IRS from rehiring former employees who had been fired for cause. Now, my staff and I met with numerous frontline IRS employees from South Dakota who are sincere and hardworking individuals. My bill is not aimed at them. This legislation is aimed at the IRS bureaucracy in Washington and is intended to address a very real problem that they have refused to fix. There is no reason that IRS leadership in Washington shouldn't be held to the same standard to which it holds you, the taxpayers. With this legislation, we can hold the IRS accountable to us for its hiring practices and ensure a high-quality workforce for the agency. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, yield myself such time as I may consume. We all agree that the IRS faces serious consumer service challenges and needs to be more responsive to the American taxpayer, but this bill is not a serious attempt at oversight of the IRS. In fact, with respect to making the IRS more responsive to taxpayers, this bill is a move in the wrong direction. But the fact that Republicans are moving in the wrong direction on tax policy really shouldn't be a surprise to any of us. They are not only starving our entire government of the resources that it needs to operate efficiently for the American public, but they are deliberately standing in the way of actual productive policies. Forget real tax reform that would bring positive benefits. They aren't even doing anything to fix what is broken in the system today. For example, the Republicans refuse to crack down on large corporations that seek to avoid paying their fair share of taxes simply by changing their mailing address from the United States to a low-tax foreign country. We see these stories on TV all the time, corporations renouncing their American citizenship to not have to pay any--any--U.S. taxes. But congressional Republicans have refused to take any action to stop these corporate tax dodgers and the resulting offshoring of American jobs. In fact, the Republicans who run Congress have protected these companies not only through their refusal to act to stop these tax inversions, but by also refusing to repeal the tax break that incentivizes U.S. companies to ship jobs overseas. Yes, American companies can claim a tax break for firing American workers and moving their jobs overseas, and my Republican colleagues are doing nothing about that. The real-world effect of the Republicans' refusal to go after these corporations that invert themselves to avoid paying their share of taxes is a heavier tax burden on the rest of our honest constituents who are playing by the rules. To address this problem, the Treasury Department recently issued new rules to stop large corporations from simply changing their post office box to avoid paying U.S. taxes. Could my constituents imagine simply changing their post office box address to eliminate their Federal taxes? Of course not. Because they can't. But somehow multinational companies, which seem to have more rights than American citizens, can. Now, you would think the American Congress would support the efforts of the American President to stop American companies from not paying the taxes here in America. But, Mr. Speaker, you would be wrong. The majority is threatening to stop the Treasury from advancing these types of commonsense rules to make multinational corporations pay their fair share of U.S. taxes just like everyone else. Wouldn't our time be better spent and served if my Republican colleagues held hearings--and passed bills--to stop companies from moving their jobs and profits overseas? Democrats stand ready to work with them to enact commonsense policies to close the loopholes in our Tax Code that encourage companies to send their profits and their jobs overseas. Unfortunately, we will have to wait for another day before the majority is serious about working together to make our tax system fairer for working people. But let me be clear. Americans will not wait any longer. They demand that we act to close these loopholes to ensure that American corporations don't cheat the system to try to avoid paying their fair share of taxes here in the United States, letting the little guy have a greater burden in their absence. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have a gentlemen here to speak on behalf of my bill who has been a strong leader in bringing integrity to the IRS. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith). Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, we are at a crossroads with our tax system. Our Tax Code is outdated, overly complicated, and the IRS has proven that it, in and of itself, is in need of serious reform. Here is an opportunity for us to work together. From the opening remarks of my colleague across the aisle, I am not sure if that is an attitude of cooperation, but certainly this is a bill we can work together on, I would hope. Our Tax Code was last updated in 1986, a generation ago. It is increasingly burdensome in this global 21st century economy. American taxpayers need a simpler code that they can easily comply with. Finally, they deserve an accountable and consistent IRS which provides exceptional taxpayer customer service. It is long past time for the status quo to change on these problems. We need tax reform. This is why I stand in support of my colleague's bill, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act. The legislation would prohibit the IRS from rehiring any individual who was previously employed by the IRS, but fired for cause. This is inconsistent and unacceptable behavior from an agency which requires the highest standard of tax compliance from taxpayers. The IRS should apply the same rigorous standard inside the agency itself. [[Page H1902]] Mr. Speaker, I wish we didn't need an act of Congress such as this, but, apparently, we do. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I have a friend and colleague here today who has fought daily for years for hardworking taxpayers across America and for his home district. I am proud to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Hamlin County, South Dakota, a very dear friend not only of every Member of Congress, but, in particular, a great Representative representing South Dakota at a time when South Dakota needs not only strong representation, but a strong voice. I want to thank the young Congresswoman for bringing this legislation to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, today is quite simple. The United States Congress has a say in the matter about how our government is run and the conduct of the government. The Internal Revenue Service has, for quite some time, been at odds, I believe, not only with their mission statement, but also at odds with their duty to publicly serve, provide information, and to do the things that enable taxpayers, who want to follow the law and need to follow the law, to comply respectfully. The Internal Revenue Service, over the last few years, has run afoul, I believe, of the American people because the commonsense obligations that they have have not been met. Today we are here on the floor with Congresswoman Noem to talk about H.R. 3724 that prohibits the Commissioner of the IRS from rehiring any employee who was involuntarily--that means forced--out or involuntarily separated from service for misconduct at the Internal Revenue Service. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported in February 2015 that the IRS had rehired those employees who had been fired from the Service for misconduct, hundreds of former employees who were terminated for well-documented conduct or performance issues. In fact, the IRS rehired 141 former employees who had substantial tax issues. That means they were not paying their own tax bills. Mr. Speaker, if we were going to hire a person in our office, we would attempt to gain information about that employee. Yesterday, as we were talking about this on the rule, a fellow colleague said: What about your own employees? Do you make sure they pay their taxes? I said: That would be a good question. No, I don't ask that question. But I would not have any idea what the real answer was--the truth--if an employee did not tell me the truth. The IRS does have the answer. They know who is paying their taxes, and they know why they fired an employee, Mr. Speaker. We are here saying that the Internal Revenue Service should not rehire these employees who were unfaithful, unfaithful to their job and unfaithful to the American taxpayer. One hundred forty-one employees who substantially did not pay their taxes represent 60 percent of all terminated for misconduct. I think I know why: because the Internal Revenue Service at the highest levels allows this to go on, and then they rehire the employees who didn't even follow the law. Mr. Speaker, that is not just misconduct. That is another level giving them an opportunity that a normal taxpayer would not have to get away with not paying their own taxes. Other misconduct issues of rehiring employees include accessing taxpayer information improperly without authorization, falsification of official forms, unacceptable behavior and performance, and abuse of IRS leave and property policies while on public time. Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Noem is doing the right thing and so is the House of Representatives. I would like to see this be a bipartisan issue, not a partisan issue. We need the IRS. We need them to do a good job. But if this were at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, would we allow that to happen? If this were at the CIA, would we allow that to happen? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 30 seconds. Mr. SESSIONS. If this were at the Department of Justice, would we allow that to happen? Why is this not a bipartisan issue? Why can't we get together and say: Mr. Koskinen, you are the Commissioner of the IRS. We respectfully would like to see you correct what you are doing. We are not on a witch hunt. We have the facts of the case, and we believe the right thing to do is to offer some remedy. That is why Republicans are on the floor today, and that is why our young Congresswoman is leading this charge. I stand behind her. I voted for the rule, and I am going to vote for this. It does the right thing. I thank the gentlewoman for the time. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, I would just add to that list of the gentleman from Texas: If it were Congress, would we allow this to happen? Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, we have another colleague here on the floor today who serves on the Ways and Means Committee and has diligently worked on IRS issues and has been a leader on bringing some clarity to the situations that we deal with in trying to bring integrity to the IRS. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci). Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2015, a bill sponsored by my good friend and colleague, Representative Kristi Noem of South Dakota. As the previous colleague said, this should be a bipartisan issue. This is an American issue. I spent most of my life in the business world. I have owned and operated over 60 different businesses, employed over 3,000 people, and created thousands of new jobs. Throughout my 30-year business career, I have had the privilege of hiring many new, talented individuals. When it comes to hiring at the IRS, the Treasury inspector general stated, ``Selecting the best candidates for employment is essential to providing the best service to America's taxpayers, maintaining public trust in tax administration, and safeguarding taxpayer's rights and privacy.'' However, the inspector general report from December 2014 found that the IRS fell short of that standard. Last year the IRS hired hundreds of employees who were terminated for misconduct. Those serious offenses included willful failure to file tax returns, unauthorized access to taxpayer information, falsification of official forms, and abuse of IRS leave and property policies. {time} 0930 As a businessman, but more importantly as a representative of the American taxpayer, I find this IG report inexcusable. It seems obvious to me, but not once did I rehire someone in the real world--in the real world--who I had previously fired for misconduct. The IRS needs to earn the trust of hardworking American taxpayers. Rehiring employees who were fired for these serious offenses further erodes that trust. H.R. 3724 directly addresses this issue. It prohibits the IRS from rehiring employees that were fired for misconduct. This is common sense. As a former businessowner, I know it is a very difficult decision to let someone go, but rehiring an individual who was asked to leave due to gross misconduct would be insulting to other employees who have faithfully served the business, and would present a significant risk to the health of the organization and its customers. The IG report found the IRS doesn't take those risks seriously. In fact, ``IRS officials stated that prior conduct and performance issues do not play a significant role in deciding the candidates who are best qualified for hiring.'' Because the IRS hasn't taken [[Page H1903]] those risks seriously, this straightforward, commonsense legislation is needed to restore accountability and trust in the IRS. I would like to commend Mrs. Noem for her leadership on this legislation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, it appears that America will have to continue to wait for action to stop companies from shifting American jobs overseas and stopping corporate tax dodgers. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3724. I would think as we look around the country right now, the integrity of what our government is and how our voters are represented and our citizens are represented, is really the case here. I thank the gentlewoman for bringing such a commonsense piece of legislation forward because we know in this town there is nothing less common than common sense. The faith and trust of the American people is based on their belief that the people who work for them are acting in their best interest, always acting in their best interest--the interest of the American people. Not in their personal interest, but in the interest of the American people. We find out that there are folks who are working on behalf of the American people, but they have somehow betrayed that faith and that trust. And folks have lost confidence in their government. They have lost confidence because of things that happened, not things that were imagined, not some whimsical idea that somehow we can get at somebody for doing this. There is no agency that is feared more in this country than the IRS. The question is: Why would they be so feared? Because they can completely shut you down, they can freeze your bank account, they can make you stay up late at night worrying about what is going to happen. When you get that letter from the IRS, the next thing you do is contact an attorney to represent you because you don't want to make a mistake, you just don't want to do it. But then you find out that within the IRS, people working for that agency, but, more importantly, working for the people of the United States, have violated that trust. These are substantiated results. This is not somebody's idea or way of getting back at somebody. This is removing bad apples and saying: you have violated, you have betrayed the trust of the American people, you are going to leave the agency, but, more importantly, you are never coming back in. This isn't any way to somehow get back at a political party or get back at anybody. This is a fact that if we cannot restore the confidence the American people have in us--their faith and their trust--why are we here? Why do we go through elections? I don't come here to represent my ideas and my beliefs. I come here to represent the values and beliefs of Pennsylvania's Third Congressional District. That is 705,687 Americans, not Republicans, not Democrats, not Libertarians, not Independents, but Americans. This piece of legislation takes into account that these are wrongdoers. These are not people who we want to associate ourselves with. These are people who have used the power of their office or of their position to somehow work against the very people who employ them. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I would just say, at this moment in our history, I thank the gentlewoman for standing up for every hardworking American taxpayer and doing the best we can to restore the faith and confidence of the American people that they can trust who it is that they elect to represent them and they can trust us to make sure that wrongdoers are punished and, once are asked to leave, are not allowed to come back in. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire how much time is remaining on both sides. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 24\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from South Dakota has 15\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz). Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mrs. Noem and her drive to address this very important issue. I believe that the overwhelming majority of the people who work at the IRS are good, hardworking, patriotic people who want to do the right thing. I have a serious problem with management and I have a serious problem with the head of the IRS, but on this issue, this is just unbelievable that we can't come to a conclusive and absolute 100 percent agreement. All we are asking for is that the bad apples, the people who will disturb what is going on in the workplace, who aren't going to act in the best interest of the United States of America, that they be excluded from participation. One of the things that is fascinating, Mr. Speaker, as we look at this, is in response to the independent review that was done of the IRS and their hiring practices. And the question here is: Should we go back and review the personnel employment file prior to rehiring somebody? This is what they said: ``Additionally, while it did find that a review of performance and conduct issues could be accomplished earlier in the process, the Department of Treasury, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Internal Revenue Service believed that it was not feasible to move the review of these issues earlier in the hiring process. This action would greatly increase the cost of hiring, likely increase cycle time beyond the Presidential mandate of 80 days, require additional resources, and not likely yield a reasonable return on investment.'' Come on. Come on. Are you kidding me? How long could it possibly take to actually go back and review somebody's performance reviews, look back at their employment history, and see if they have been acting in the best interest of the United States of America? Clearly, in the examples that are there, there are people that willfully don't even file their own tax returns, there are people that are doing some bad, stupid stuff. They don't think they have the time and resources to look at it in advance; we have to actually pass a piece of legislation requiring this? That seems entirely reasonable. It is not overly burdensome. Here you have an organization, the IRS, that can actually destroy somebody's life by a mere letter showing up in your mailbox, and they can't even take the time to look at somebody's employment history, somebody who has already worked at the IRS? That is how absurd this organization is, and that is why this piece of legislation is so easy to understand, it is so easy to vote for. It is not a partisan issue. This is just saying: Do you know what? For all the good people who work at the IRS, let's make sure that the new people who come on, or the rehires who come on, in this case, are actually addressed and we look at their information prior to hiring. It is that simple. That is why I am in favor of this bill. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds. I am still waiting for a bill to keep American jobs in America and not export them overseas through the Tax Code. I will continue to wait for that bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, today, we are talking about a bill that will bring integrity to the IRS, which will better serve our taxpayers into the future. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise). Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I really want to thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota for her leadership in bringing this bill forward. Mr. Speaker, this bill is about restoring trust. This bill is about holding the IRS accountable. Here we are, in a week where Americans had to file their tax returns. And so often, just the letters I-R-S send a chilling effect through people when they hear those [[Page H1904]] letters. Yet, you look at the arrogance over at the IRS, just the attitude that they have and the disdain it seems that they have towards the very people who pay their bills--the taxpayers. Here you have a case where people who have been fired by the IRS for abusing their positions are actually being rehired back to the IRS. Again, this is the kind of disdain that disgusts people as they fear the IRS. The IRS ought to have the same fear towards the people who pay their salaries as people get when they get that letter from the IRS. Mr. Speaker, we have had inspector general reports in the Treasury Department. The inspector general found over 140 IRS agents aren't even accurate in their taxes. The very people who are responsible for auditing American citizens aren't even paying their own taxes. This is the kind of disregard for the American people that we are seeing over at the IRS, and it is time to rein it in. It is time to bring some accountability and transparency back to the IRS. Who is afraid of that? What is so wrong with saying: If somebody has been fired for cause over at the IRS, with the access they have to such sensitive personal information of taxpayers, why should they be rehired back? It is just basic common sense that if somebody has abused their position at the IRS, enough is enough, and they shouldn't be able to return and have access to that sensitive information anymore. I want to applaud, again, the gentlewoman from South Dakota for bringing this commonsense bill forward. I would urge adoption later on when we have this vote on the House floor. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop). Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my friend from South Dakota for her leadership in holding the IRS accountable for what we are seeing today. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act, to join in the outrage with my colleagues today on what we are seeing at the IRS. With tax day hitting earlier this week, I think this is an ideal time to highlight the need for continued oversight and, perhaps, ramped-up oversight of the Internal Revenue Service. Last February, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported that the IRS had a tendency to rehire former employees with serious misconduct and performance issues. In their review, they found more than 100 former employees were rehired by the IRS despite having significant performance and misconduct problems, like willfully failing to file tax returns: a rather important thing for most of us, but apparently not for IRS employees. Mr. Speaker, the families in my district and I are 100 percent fed up with adhering to a standard that the IRS doesn't even hold their own employees to. We simply will not tolerate the rehiring of incompetent individuals who fail to do their job in the first place. It is time to put a leash on the IRS and prevent taxpayers from further double standards and further abuse. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 3724. Again, I thank my colleague from South Dakota for her excellent leadership on this. I look forward to open debate and voting on this matter as soon as possible. {time} 0945 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. No disrespect to the sponsor of this bill whatsoever. I have great admiration for her, as she knows, but I believe that this bill could have been taken up on the consent calendar, quite frankly, with all of this discussion about the support on both sides. The reality is, though, that we are using precious time here on the floor on an issue that, as I say, could have been on the consent calendar. We are not addressing the real issue of concern to the American people, which is of the continuing loss of jobs here in America because of our Tax Code, which we refuse to fix, that is shifting jobs and American corporations overseas to inversion and also shifting American jobs overseas because of those inversions. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CROWLEY. I yield myself an additional 15 seconds. Mr. Speaker, we are not having a hearing on this. We are not doing anything here on the floor to address this issue. Instead, we are taking up issues that, quite frankly, could have been on the consent calendar. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I am ready to close. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I believe this should be the beginning and not the end of a discussion on how to best plug the giant corporate loopholes that are allowing companies to skip out on paying the same taxes that all of our constituents have to pay. This is one of the many major issues this Congress should undertake; but, instead, we are all too busy governing by press releases. This Congress has done nothing to address the Zika virus, which could be a threat to all women who are pregnant or who are looking to become pregnant; but we have this consent bill here on the floor for debate. This Congress has done nothing to address the crisis of lead in our drinking water--a crisis vividly on display in Flint but one that lurks in the pipes of hundreds of cities and towns across our great land; yet we have this consent bill here on the calendar for debate. This Congress hasn't even attempted to pass a budget for our country--the majority has not proposed a budget for our country--which is one of the most basic functions we can do as an institution to make sure we make the necessary investments possible while also getting our economic house in order; yet we have what I would consider to be a consent calendar bill here on the floor today, taking up an hour's debate. But we will always have time for message bills. Sure, they don't create a job for an unemployed person in New York or in Flint or in Houston or in L.A., and they don't increase the take-home pay of any underpaid worker or make college more affordable for middle class kids or strengthen Social Security for our seniors of today and tomorrow, but they will sound great on talk radio tonight and over the weekend-- we are going after the IRS again. They don't even deal with the Tax Code even though this bill is advertised as the Republicans' idea of tax reform. It does not reform the Tax Code in any way, shape, or form, but that is what they portray it as. Let me explain something about the Tax Code to my Republican colleagues. Our Tax Code is inefficient. You see that when large corporations are paying less tax than the employees who work for them. It is overly complicated. You see that when multinational corporations avoid paying the same taxes as our constituents back home have to pay simply by their hiring expensive lawyers that our constituents, quite frankly, cannot afford. It is unfair. You see that when corporations can dodge paying their fair share of taxes by simply switching their post office boxes to foreign countries--something our neighbors back home, if they attempted to do, would be arrested for, for tax evasion, but not corporations. Individuals, if you do that, you are arrested for tax evasion, but not an American corporation; yet my Republican colleagues continue to refuse to address this issue. Maybe more importantly than anything else, it does not promote job growth here in the United States. You see this when Congress refuses to repeal the tax breaks for companies to fire their workers here and move their jobs overseas. This Congress must tackle these serious issues, but we are not doing that today. We continue to wait for legislation--for a hearing--on these important issues. Democrats stand ready to work with you all, my Republican colleagues, on commonsense legislation that plugs the corporate tax loopholes that are literally draining the funds our country needs in order to function properly. Democrats stand ready to work with you to fix the Tax Code that is not only inefficient, not only complicated, not [[Page H1905]] only unfair, but that does not promote job growth here in the United States. That is something we want to work with you on in a bipartisan way. Unfortunately, we have to continue to wait for another day before the majority is serious about working together, in a bipartisan way, to make our tax system fairer for all working men and women in the United States. Let me be clear, once again, that the American people will not wait any longer. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. We have heard repeatedly from my colleague on the other side of the aisle about why we should not be spending time on this topic today, about why we shouldn't have dedicated an hour's worth of debate to making sure that we talk about H.R. 3724, Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act. I think he has forgotten about what kind of information the people of this country turn over to the IRS. They turn over their Social Security numbers, their financial information; a lot of the security that they have for their families, their homes, and their businesses they completely trust the IRS to take care of, to protect, and to make sure that they use in the correct manner so that they might abide by the law and pay their taxes like honest, hardworking Americans do. To say that we shouldn't spend time in making sure that criminals and people who are fired for misconduct don't have access to that information, to me, is silly. That is exactly what our job is. The IRS needs integrity, and we are here to bring it today. Mr. Speaker, the White House has issued a veto threat against this bill. They said that the IRS would be forced to fire people, because of this bill, if it were signed into law. I read the White House's Statement of Administration Policy on my bill, and the statement reads that it is unnecessary because current IRS processes already ensure that the agency does not rehire former employees who have significant conduct issues. I guess the White House didn't read the report, for the inspector general expressed concerns that the IRS continues to hire individuals who have significant prior conduct and performance issues even after the agency supposedly made upgrades to its hiring practices. I remind you, Mr. Speaker, that the inspector general's review of former employees who were fired for serious misconduct and who were then rehired included employees with histories of fraud, a falsification of documents, workplace disruption, absence, and an unauthorized accessing of taxpayer information. The inspector general identified approximately 140 individuals who are currently, today, with the IRS who had been previously fired for cause. We are talking about an agency that employs 80,000 people. Surely, it can find 140 people who haven't committed fraud or falsified documents. Mr. Speaker, the inspector general recommended that the IRS reassess its hiring practices to determine in what part of the process it should fully vet candidates in terms of their prior performance. In fact, the IRS was given an opportunity to fully respond to the inspector general's report. In its response, the agency insisted its processes were sufficient. Yet, Mr. Speaker, the agency still only begins to vet the candidates for employment only after the entire hiring process is completed and after a formal offer of employment has been extended. So, regardless of any changes the IRS has made to its hiring practices, the inspector general said he remains very concerned because IRS documents indicate it is hiring individuals who have significant prior conduct and performance issues. Mr. Speaker, because the IRS hasn't taken action is why we are here today. This bill is simple. It just says that the IRS cannot rehire employees who have been fired for misconduct. It is something the IRS should have taken action on; and because they didn't, that is why we are here today. It is our job to protect the taxpayers and to make sure their information is safe with the agency that they, by law, need to turn over to the IRS. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 688, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1900-H1905] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENSURING INTEGRITY IN THE IRS WORKFORCE ACT OF 2015 Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 688, I call up the bill (H.R. 3724) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prohibit the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service from rehiring any employee of the Internal Revenue Service who was involuntarily separated from service for misconduct, and ask for its immediate consideration.

The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: H.R. 3724 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON REHIRING ANY EMPLOYEE OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE WHO WAS INVOLUNTARILY SEPARATED FROM SERVICE FOR MISCONDUCT.

Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from South Dakota. General Leave Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to [[Page H1901]] revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 3724, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from North Dakota? There was no objection. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan bill, H.R. 3724, Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act. With tax day just behind us, most Americans have finished their tax returns. They filled out form after form, giving the IRS some of the most sensitive information possible, including their Social Security numbers, their birth dates, wage data, and more. In 2014, the inspector general for the IRS released a report that raised serious questions about whose hands this information falls into once it arrives at the IRS. More specifically, an audit of the agency's hiring practices found that the IRS rehired hundreds of former employees whom the IRS had previously fired because of conduct problems. And we are not talking about small infractions. The IRS rehired employees who had falsified documents. They failed to pay their own taxes. They accessed sensitive taxpayer information without permission. To think that someone could inappropriately access tax information, get fired for doing so, and then be rehired just a few months later is completely unacceptable. But it has happened, and it has happened more than once. These stories border on the absurd. One employee had been absent without leave for a total of 8 weeks worth of work. As a result, that employee was fired, and the words ``do not rehire'' were stamped on that personnel file. Still, the IRS rehired that person. IRS leadership has failed to acknowledge its mistakes or change its processes. Instead, they stuck their heads in the sand. According to the inspector general, the IRS' response to the report was that it believed its current process was good enough. Well, I don't buy it, and if the IRS leadership thinks its current processes are protecting taxpayers, they need a reality check. {time} 0915 The Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act is a simple, bipartisan fix to a serious problem. The bill does what the IRS bureaucracy in Washington won't: it stops the IRS from rehiring former employees who had been fired for cause. Now, my staff and I met with numerous frontline IRS employees from South Dakota who are sincere and hardworking individuals. My bill is not aimed at them. This legislation is aimed at the IRS bureaucracy in Washington and is intended to address a very real problem that they have refused to fix. There is no reason that IRS leadership in Washington shouldn't be held to the same standard to which it holds you, the taxpayers. With this legislation, we can hold the IRS accountable to us for its hiring practices and ensure a high-quality workforce for the agency. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, yield myself such time as I may consume. We all agree that the IRS faces serious consumer service challenges and needs to be more responsive to the American taxpayer, but this bill is not a serious attempt at oversight of the IRS. In fact, with respect to making the IRS more responsive to taxpayers, this bill is a move in the wrong direction. But the fact that Republicans are moving in the wrong direction on tax policy really shouldn't be a surprise to any of us. They are not only starving our entire government of the resources that it needs to operate efficiently for the American public, but they are deliberately standing in the way of actual productive policies. Forget real tax reform that would bring positive benefits. They aren't even doing anything to fix what is broken in the system today. For example, the Republicans refuse to crack down on large corporations that seek to avoid paying their fair share of taxes simply by changing their mailing address from the United States to a low-tax foreign country. We see these stories on TV all the time, corporations renouncing their American citizenship to not have to pay any--any--U.S. taxes. But congressional Republicans have refused to take any action to stop these corporate tax dodgers and the resulting offshoring of American jobs. In fact, the Republicans who run Congress have protected these companies not only through their refusal to act to stop these tax inversions, but by also refusing to repeal the tax break that incentivizes U.S. companies to ship jobs overseas. Yes, American companies can claim a tax break for firing American workers and moving their jobs overseas, and my Republican colleagues are doing nothing about that. The real-world effect of the Republicans' refusal to go after these corporations that invert themselves to avoid paying their share of taxes is a heavier tax burden on the rest of our honest constituents who are playing by the rules. To address this problem, the Treasury Department recently issued new rules to stop large corporations from simply changing their post office box to avoid paying U.S. taxes. Could my constituents imagine simply changing their post office box address to eliminate their Federal taxes? Of course not. Because they can't. But somehow multinational companies, which seem to have more rights than American citizens, can. Now, you would think the American Congress would support the efforts of the American President to stop American companies from not paying the taxes here in America. But, Mr. Speaker, you would be wrong. The majority is threatening to stop the Treasury from advancing these types of commonsense rules to make multinational corporations pay their fair share of U.S. taxes just like everyone else. Wouldn't our time be better spent and served if my Republican colleagues held hearings--and passed bills--to stop companies from moving their jobs and profits overseas? Democrats stand ready to work with them to enact commonsense policies to close the loopholes in our Tax Code that encourage companies to send their profits and their jobs overseas. Unfortunately, we will have to wait for another day before the majority is serious about working together to make our tax system fairer for working people. But let me be clear. Americans will not wait any longer. They demand that we act to close these loopholes to ensure that American corporations don't cheat the system to try to avoid paying their fair share of taxes here in the United States, letting the little guy have a greater burden in their absence. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have a gentlemen here to speak on behalf of my bill who has been a strong leader in bringing integrity to the IRS. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith). Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, we are at a crossroads with our tax system. Our Tax Code is outdated, overly complicated, and the IRS has proven that it, in and of itself, is in need of serious reform. Here is an opportunity for us to work together. From the opening remarks of my colleague across the aisle, I am not sure if that is an attitude of cooperation, but certainly this is a bill we can work together on, I would hope. Our Tax Code was last updated in 1986, a generation ago. It is increasingly burdensome in this global 21st century economy. American taxpayers need a simpler code that they can easily comply with. Finally, they deserve an accountable and consistent IRS which provides exceptional taxpayer customer service. It is long past time for the status quo to change on these problems. We need tax reform. This is why I stand in support of my colleague's bill, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act. The legislation would prohibit the IRS from rehiring any individual who was previously employed by the IRS, but fired for cause. This is inconsistent and unacceptable behavior from an agency which requires the highest standard of tax compliance from taxpayers. The IRS should apply the same rigorous standard inside the agency itself. [[Page H1902]] Mr. Speaker, I wish we didn't need an act of Congress such as this, but, apparently, we do. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I have a friend and colleague here today who has fought daily for years for hardworking taxpayers across America and for his home district. I am proud to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Hamlin County, South Dakota, a very dear friend not only of every Member of Congress, but, in particular, a great Representative representing South Dakota at a time when South Dakota needs not only strong representation, but a strong voice. I want to thank the young Congresswoman for bringing this legislation to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, today is quite simple. The United States Congress has a say in the matter about how our government is run and the conduct of the government. The Internal Revenue Service has, for quite some time, been at odds, I believe, not only with their mission statement, but also at odds with their duty to publicly serve, provide information, and to do the things that enable taxpayers, who want to follow the law and need to follow the law, to comply respectfully. The Internal Revenue Service, over the last few years, has run afoul, I believe, of the American people because the commonsense obligations that they have have not been met. Today we are here on the floor with Congresswoman Noem to talk about H.R. 3724 that prohibits the Commissioner of the IRS from rehiring any employee who was involuntarily--that means forced--out or involuntarily separated from service for misconduct at the Internal Revenue Service. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported in February 2015 that the IRS had rehired those employees who had been fired from the Service for misconduct, hundreds of former employees who were terminated for well-documented conduct or performance issues. In fact, the IRS rehired 141 former employees who had substantial tax issues. That means they were not paying their own tax bills. Mr. Speaker, if we were going to hire a person in our office, we would attempt to gain information about that employee. Yesterday, as we were talking about this on the rule, a fellow colleague said: What about your own employees? Do you make sure they pay their taxes? I said: That would be a good question. No, I don't ask that question. But I would not have any idea what the real answer was--the truth--if an employee did not tell me the truth. The IRS does have the answer. They know who is paying their taxes, and they know why they fired an employee, Mr. Speaker. We are here saying that the Internal Revenue Service should not rehire these employees who were unfaithful, unfaithful to their job and unfaithful to the American taxpayer. One hundred forty-one employees who substantially did not pay their taxes represent 60 percent of all terminated for misconduct. I think I know why: because the Internal Revenue Service at the highest levels allows this to go on, and then they rehire the employees who didn't even follow the law. Mr. Speaker, that is not just misconduct. That is another level giving them an opportunity that a normal taxpayer would not have to get away with not paying their own taxes. Other misconduct issues of rehiring employees include accessing taxpayer information improperly without authorization, falsification of official forms, unacceptable behavior and performance, and abuse of IRS leave and property policies while on public time. Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Noem is doing the right thing and so is the House of Representatives. I would like to see this be a bipartisan issue, not a partisan issue. We need the IRS. We need them to do a good job. But if this were at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, would we allow that to happen? If this were at the CIA, would we allow that to happen? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 30 seconds. Mr. SESSIONS. If this were at the Department of Justice, would we allow that to happen? Why is this not a bipartisan issue? Why can't we get together and say: Mr. Koskinen, you are the Commissioner of the IRS. We respectfully would like to see you correct what you are doing. We are not on a witch hunt. We have the facts of the case, and we believe the right thing to do is to offer some remedy. That is why Republicans are on the floor today, and that is why our young Congresswoman is leading this charge. I stand behind her. I voted for the rule, and I am going to vote for this. It does the right thing. I thank the gentlewoman for the time. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, I would just add to that list of the gentleman from Texas: If it were Congress, would we allow this to happen? Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, we have another colleague here on the floor today who serves on the Ways and Means Committee and has diligently worked on IRS issues and has been a leader on bringing some clarity to the situations that we deal with in trying to bring integrity to the IRS. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci). Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2015, a bill sponsored by my good friend and colleague, Representative Kristi Noem of South Dakota. As the previous colleague said, this should be a bipartisan issue. This is an American issue. I spent most of my life in the business world. I have owned and operated over 60 different businesses, employed over 3,000 people, and created thousands of new jobs. Throughout my 30-year business career, I have had the privilege of hiring many new, talented individuals. When it comes to hiring at the IRS, the Treasury inspector general stated, ``Selecting the best candidates for employment is essential to providing the best service to America's taxpayers, maintaining public trust in tax administration, and safeguarding taxpayer's rights and privacy.'' However, the inspector general report from December 2014 found that the IRS fell short of that standard. Last year the IRS hired hundreds of employees who were terminated for misconduct. Those serious offenses included willful failure to file tax returns, unauthorized access to taxpayer information, falsification of official forms, and abuse of IRS leave and property policies. {time} 0930 As a businessman, but more importantly as a representative of the American taxpayer, I find this IG report inexcusable. It seems obvious to me, but not once did I rehire someone in the real world--in the real world--who I had previously fired for misconduct. The IRS needs to earn the trust of hardworking American taxpayers. Rehiring employees who were fired for these serious offenses further erodes that trust. H.R. 3724 directly addresses this issue. It prohibits the IRS from rehiring employees that were fired for misconduct. This is common sense. As a former businessowner, I know it is a very difficult decision to let someone go, but rehiring an individual who was asked to leave due to gross misconduct would be insulting to other employees who have faithfully served the business, and would present a significant risk to the health of the organization and its customers. The IG report found the IRS doesn't take those risks seriously. In fact, ``IRS officials stated that prior conduct and performance issues do not play a significant role in deciding the candidates who are best qualified for hiring.'' Because the IRS hasn't taken [[Page H1903]] those risks seriously, this straightforward, commonsense legislation is needed to restore accountability and trust in the IRS. I would like to commend Mrs. Noem for her leadership on this legislation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, it appears that America will have to continue to wait for action to stop companies from shifting American jobs overseas and stopping corporate tax dodgers. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3724. I would think as we look around the country right now, the integrity of what our government is and how our voters are represented and our citizens are represented, is really the case here. I thank the gentlewoman for bringing such a commonsense piece of legislation forward because we know in this town there is nothing less common than common sense. The faith and trust of the American people is based on their belief that the people who work for them are acting in their best interest, always acting in their best interest--the interest of the American people. Not in their personal interest, but in the interest of the American people. We find out that there are folks who are working on behalf of the American people, but they have somehow betrayed that faith and that trust. And folks have lost confidence in their government. They have lost confidence because of things that happened, not things that were imagined, not some whimsical idea that somehow we can get at somebody for doing this. There is no agency that is feared more in this country than the IRS. The question is: Why would they be so feared? Because they can completely shut you down, they can freeze your bank account, they can make you stay up late at night worrying about what is going to happen. When you get that letter from the IRS, the next thing you do is contact an attorney to represent you because you don't want to make a mistake, you just don't want to do it. But then you find out that within the IRS, people working for that agency, but, more importantly, working for the people of the United States, have violated that trust. These are substantiated results. This is not somebody's idea or way of getting back at somebody. This is removing bad apples and saying: you have violated, you have betrayed the trust of the American people, you are going to leave the agency, but, more importantly, you are never coming back in. This isn't any way to somehow get back at a political party or get back at anybody. This is a fact that if we cannot restore the confidence the American people have in us--their faith and their trust--why are we here? Why do we go through elections? I don't come here to represent my ideas and my beliefs. I come here to represent the values and beliefs of Pennsylvania's Third Congressional District. That is 705,687 Americans, not Republicans, not Democrats, not Libertarians, not Independents, but Americans. This piece of legislation takes into account that these are wrongdoers. These are not people who we want to associate ourselves with. These are people who have used the power of their office or of their position to somehow work against the very people who employ them. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I would just say, at this moment in our history, I thank the gentlewoman for standing up for every hardworking American taxpayer and doing the best we can to restore the faith and confidence of the American people that they can trust who it is that they elect to represent them and they can trust us to make sure that wrongdoers are punished and, once are asked to leave, are not allowed to come back in. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire how much time is remaining on both sides. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 24\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from South Dakota has 15\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz). Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mrs. Noem and her drive to address this very important issue. I believe that the overwhelming majority of the people who work at the IRS are good, hardworking, patriotic people who want to do the right thing. I have a serious problem with management and I have a serious problem with the head of the IRS, but on this issue, this is just unbelievable that we can't come to a conclusive and absolute 100 percent agreement. All we are asking for is that the bad apples, the people who will disturb what is going on in the workplace, who aren't going to act in the best interest of the United States of America, that they be excluded from participation. One of the things that is fascinating, Mr. Speaker, as we look at this, is in response to the independent review that was done of the IRS and their hiring practices. And the question here is: Should we go back and review the personnel employment file prior to rehiring somebody? This is what they said: ``Additionally, while it did find that a review of performance and conduct issues could be accomplished earlier in the process, the Department of Treasury, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Internal Revenue Service believed that it was not feasible to move the review of these issues earlier in the hiring process. This action would greatly increase the cost of hiring, likely increase cycle time beyond the Presidential mandate of 80 days, require additional resources, and not likely yield a reasonable return on investment.'' Come on. Come on. Are you kidding me? How long could it possibly take to actually go back and review somebody's performance reviews, look back at their employment history, and see if they have been acting in the best interest of the United States of America? Clearly, in the examples that are there, there are people that willfully don't even file their own tax returns, there are people that are doing some bad, stupid stuff. They don't think they have the time and resources to look at it in advance; we have to actually pass a piece of legislation requiring this? That seems entirely reasonable. It is not overly burdensome. Here you have an organization, the IRS, that can actually destroy somebody's life by a mere letter showing up in your mailbox, and they can't even take the time to look at somebody's employment history, somebody who has already worked at the IRS? That is how absurd this organization is, and that is why this piece of legislation is so easy to understand, it is so easy to vote for. It is not a partisan issue. This is just saying: Do you know what? For all the good people who work at the IRS, let's make sure that the new people who come on, or the rehires who come on, in this case, are actually addressed and we look at their information prior to hiring. It is that simple. That is why I am in favor of this bill. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds. I am still waiting for a bill to keep American jobs in America and not export them overseas through the Tax Code. I will continue to wait for that bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, today, we are talking about a bill that will bring integrity to the IRS, which will better serve our taxpayers into the future. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise). Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I really want to thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota for her leadership in bringing this bill forward. Mr. Speaker, this bill is about restoring trust. This bill is about holding the IRS accountable. Here we are, in a week where Americans had to file their tax returns. And so often, just the letters I-R-S send a chilling effect through people when they hear those [[Page H1904]] letters. Yet, you look at the arrogance over at the IRS, just the attitude that they have and the disdain it seems that they have towards the very people who pay their bills--the taxpayers. Here you have a case where people who have been fired by the IRS for abusing their positions are actually being rehired back to the IRS. Again, this is the kind of disdain that disgusts people as they fear the IRS. The IRS ought to have the same fear towards the people who pay their salaries as people get when they get that letter from the IRS. Mr. Speaker, we have had inspector general reports in the Treasury Department. The inspector general found over 140 IRS agents aren't even accurate in their taxes. The very people who are responsible for auditing American citizens aren't even paying their own taxes. This is the kind of disregard for the American people that we are seeing over at the IRS, and it is time to rein it in. It is time to bring some accountability and transparency back to the IRS. Who is afraid of that? What is so wrong with saying: If somebody has been fired for cause over at the IRS, with the access they have to such sensitive personal information of taxpayers, why should they be rehired back? It is just basic common sense that if somebody has abused their position at the IRS, enough is enough, and they shouldn't be able to return and have access to that sensitive information anymore. I want to applaud, again, the gentlewoman from South Dakota for bringing this commonsense bill forward. I would urge adoption later on when we have this vote on the House floor. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop). Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my friend from South Dakota for her leadership in holding the IRS accountable for what we are seeing today. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act, to join in the outrage with my colleagues today on what we are seeing at the IRS. With tax day hitting earlier this week, I think this is an ideal time to highlight the need for continued oversight and, perhaps, ramped-up oversight of the Internal Revenue Service. Last February, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported that the IRS had a tendency to rehire former employees with serious misconduct and performance issues. In their review, they found more than 100 former employees were rehired by the IRS despite having significant performance and misconduct problems, like willfully failing to file tax returns: a rather important thing for most of us, but apparently not for IRS employees. Mr. Speaker, the families in my district and I are 100 percent fed up with adhering to a standard that the IRS doesn't even hold their own employees to. We simply will not tolerate the rehiring of incompetent individuals who fail to do their job in the first place. It is time to put a leash on the IRS and prevent taxpayers from further double standards and further abuse. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 3724. Again, I thank my colleague from South Dakota for her excellent leadership on this. I look forward to open debate and voting on this matter as soon as possible. {time} 0945 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. No disrespect to the sponsor of this bill whatsoever. I have great admiration for her, as she knows, but I believe that this bill could have been taken up on the consent calendar, quite frankly, with all of this discussion about the support on both sides. The reality is, though, that we are using precious time here on the floor on an issue that, as I say, could have been on the consent calendar. We are not addressing the real issue of concern to the American people, which is of the continuing loss of jobs here in America because of our Tax Code, which we refuse to fix, that is shifting jobs and American corporations overseas to inversion and also shifting American jobs overseas because of those inversions. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CROWLEY. I yield myself an additional 15 seconds. Mr. Speaker, we are not having a hearing on this. We are not doing anything here on the floor to address this issue. Instead, we are taking up issues that, quite frankly, could have been on the consent calendar. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I am ready to close. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I believe this should be the beginning and not the end of a discussion on how to best plug the giant corporate loopholes that are allowing companies to skip out on paying the same taxes that all of our constituents have to pay. This is one of the many major issues this Congress should undertake; but, instead, we are all too busy governing by press releases. This Congress has done nothing to address the Zika virus, which could be a threat to all women who are pregnant or who are looking to become pregnant; but we have this consent bill here on the floor for debate. This Congress has done nothing to address the crisis of lead in our drinking water--a crisis vividly on display in Flint but one that lurks in the pipes of hundreds of cities and towns across our great land; yet we have this consent bill here on the calendar for debate. This Congress hasn't even attempted to pass a budget for our country--the majority has not proposed a budget for our country--which is one of the most basic functions we can do as an institution to make sure we make the necessary investments possible while also getting our economic house in order; yet we have what I would consider to be a consent calendar bill here on the floor today, taking up an hour's debate. But we will always have time for message bills. Sure, they don't create a job for an unemployed person in New York or in Flint or in Houston or in L.A., and they don't increase the take-home pay of any underpaid worker or make college more affordable for middle class kids or strengthen Social Security for our seniors of today and tomorrow, but they will sound great on talk radio tonight and over the weekend-- we are going after the IRS again. They don't even deal with the Tax Code even though this bill is advertised as the Republicans' idea of tax reform. It does not reform the Tax Code in any way, shape, or form, but that is what they portray it as. Let me explain something about the Tax Code to my Republican colleagues. Our Tax Code is inefficient. You see that when large corporations are paying less tax than the employees who work for them. It is overly complicated. You see that when multinational corporations avoid paying the same taxes as our constituents back home have to pay simply by their hiring expensive lawyers that our constituents, quite frankly, cannot afford. It is unfair. You see that when corporations can dodge paying their fair share of taxes by simply switching their post office boxes to foreign countries--something our neighbors back home, if they attempted to do, would be arrested for, for tax evasion, but not corporations. Individuals, if you do that, you are arrested for tax evasion, but not an American corporation; yet my Republican colleagues continue to refuse to address this issue. Maybe more importantly than anything else, it does not promote job growth here in the United States. You see this when Congress refuses to repeal the tax breaks for companies to fire their workers here and move their jobs overseas. This Congress must tackle these serious issues, but we are not doing that today. We continue to wait for legislation--for a hearing--on these important issues. Democrats stand ready to work with you all, my Republican colleagues, on commonsense legislation that plugs the corporate tax loopholes that are literally draining the funds our country needs in order to function properly. Democrats stand ready to work with you to fix the Tax Code that is not only inefficient, not only complicated, not [[Page H1905]] only unfair, but that does not promote job growth here in the United States. That is something we want to work with you on in a bipartisan way. Unfortunately, we have to continue to wait for another day before the majority is serious about working together, in a bipartisan way, to make our tax system fairer for all working men and women in the United States. Let me be clear, once again, that the American people will not wait any longer. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. We have heard repeatedly from my colleague on the other side of the aisle about why we should not be spending time on this topic today, about why we shouldn't have dedicated an hour's worth of debate to making sure that we talk about H.R. 3724, Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act. I think he has forgotten about what kind of information the people of this country turn over to the IRS. They turn over their Social Security numbers, their financial information; a lot of the security that they have for their families, their homes, and their businesses they completely trust the IRS to take care of, to protect, and to make sure that they use in the correct manner so that they might abide by the law and pay their taxes like honest, hardworking Americans do. To say that we shouldn't spend time in making sure that criminals and people who are fired for misconduct don't have access to that information, to me, is silly. That is exactly what our job is. The IRS needs integrity, and we are here to bring it today. Mr. Speaker, the White House has issued a veto threat against this bill. They said that the IRS would be forced to fire people, because of this bill, if it were signed into law. I read the White House's Statement of Administration Policy on my bill, and the statement reads that it is unnecessary because current IRS processes already ensure that the agency does not rehire former employees who have significant conduct issues. I guess the White House didn't read the report, for the inspector general expressed concerns that the IRS continues to hire individuals who have significant prior conduct and performance issues even after the agency supposedly made upgrades to its hiring practices. I remind you, Mr. Speaker, that the inspector general's review of former employees who were fired for serious misconduct and who were then rehired included employees with histories of fraud, a falsification of documents, workplace disruption, absence, and an unauthorized accessing of taxpayer information. The inspector general identified approximately 140 individuals who are currently, today, with the IRS who had been previously fired for cause. We are talking about an agency that employs 80,000 people. Surely, it can find 140 people who haven't committed fraud or falsified documents. Mr. Speaker, the inspector general recommended that the IRS reassess its hiring practices to determine in what part of the process it should fully vet candidates in terms of their prior performance. In fact, the IRS was given an opportunity to fully respond to the inspector general's report. In its response, the agency insisted its processes were sufficient. Yet, Mr. Speaker, the agency still only begins to vet the candidates for employment only after the entire hiring process is completed and after a formal offer of employment has been extended. So, regardless of any changes the IRS has made to its hiring practices, the inspector general said he remains very concerned because IRS documents indicate it is hiring individuals who have significant prior conduct and performance issues. Mr. Speaker, because the IRS hasn't taken action is why we are here today. This bill is simple. It just says that the IRS cannot rehire employees who have been fired for misconduct. It is something the IRS should have taken action on; and because they didn't, that is why we are here today. It is our job to protect the taxpayers and to make sure their information is safe with the agency that they, by law, need to turn over to the IRS. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 688, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_168.csv,39824,39824,39893,"[congressional record volume 162, number 62 (thursday, april 21, 2016)] [house] [pages h1900-h1905] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] ensuring integrity in the irs workforce act of 2015 mrs. noem. mr. speaker, pursuant to house resolution 688, i call up the bill (h.r. 3724) to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to prohibit the commissioner of the internal revenue service from rehiring any employee of the internal revenue service who was involuntarily separated from service for misconduct, and ask for its immediate consideration. the clerk read the title of the bill. the speaker pro tempore (mr. rodney davis of illinois). pursuant to house resolution 688, in lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on ways and means, printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of rules committee print 114-48, is adopted and the bill, as amended, is considered read. the text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: h.r. 3724 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``ensuring integrity in the irs workforce act of 2016''. sec. 2. prohibition on rehiring any employee of the internal revenue service who was involuntarily separated from service for misconduct.

gentlewoman from south dakota. general leave mrs. noem. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to [[page h1901]] revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on h.r. 3724, currently under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from north dakota? there was no objection. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of my bipartisan bill, h.r. 3724, ensuring integrity in the irs workforce act. with tax day just behind us, most americans have finished their tax returns. they filled out form after form, giving the irs some of the most sensitive information possible, including their social security numbers, their birth dates, wage data, and more. in 2014, the inspector general for the irs released a report that raised serious questions about whose hands this information falls into once it arrives at the irs. more specifically, an audit of the agency's hiring practices found that the irs rehired hundreds of former employees whom the irs had previously fired because of conduct problems. and we are not talking about small infractions. the irs rehired employees who had falsified documents. they failed to pay their own taxes. they accessed sensitive taxpayer information without permission. to think that someone could inappropriately access tax information, get fired for doing so, and then be rehired just a few months later is completely unacceptable. but it has happened, and it has happened more than once. these stories border on the absurd. one employee had been absent without leave for a total of 8 weeks worth of work. as a result, that employee was fired, and the words ``do not rehire'' were stamped on that personnel file. still, the irs rehired that person. irs leadership has failed to acknowledge its mistakes or change its processes. instead, they stuck their heads in the sand. according to the inspector general, the irs' response to the report was that it believed its current process was good enough. well, i don't buy it, and if the irs leadership thinks its current processes are protecting taxpayers, they need a reality check. {time} 0915 the ensuring integrity in the irs workforce act is a simple, bipartisan fix to a serious problem. the bill does what the irs bureaucracy in washington won't: it stops the irs from rehiring former employees who had been fired for cause. now, my staff and i met with numerous frontline irs employees from south dakota who are sincere and hardworking individuals. my bill is not aimed at them. this legislation is aimed at the irs bureaucracy in washington and is intended to address a very real problem that they have refused to fix. there is no reason that irs leadership in washington shouldn't be held to the same standard to which it holds you, the taxpayers. with this legislation, we can hold the irs accountable to us for its hiring practices and ensure a high-quality workforce for the agency. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, yield myself such time as i may consume. we all agree that the irs faces serious consumer service challenges and needs to be more responsive to the american taxpayer, but this bill is not a serious attempt at oversight of the irs. in fact, with respect to making the irs more responsive to taxpayers, this bill is a move in the wrong direction. but the fact that republicans are moving in the wrong direction on tax policy really shouldn't be a surprise to any of us. they are not only starving our entire government of the resources that it needs to operate efficiently for the american public, but they are deliberately standing in the way of actual productive policies. forget real tax reform that would bring positive benefits. they aren't even doing anything to fix what is broken in the system today. for example, the republicans refuse to crack down on large corporations that seek to avoid paying their fair share of taxes simply by changing their mailing address from the united states to a low-tax foreign country. we see these stories on tv all the time, corporations renouncing their american citizenship to not have to pay any--any--u.s. taxes. but congressional republicans have refused to take any action to stop these corporate tax dodgers and the resulting offshoring of american jobs. in fact, the republicans who run congress have protected these companies not only through their refusal to act to stop these tax inversions, but by also refusing to repeal the tax break that incentivizes u.s. companies to ship jobs overseas. yes, american companies can claim a tax break for firing american workers and moving their jobs overseas, and my republican colleagues are doing nothing about that. the real-world effect of the republicans' refusal to go after these corporations that invert themselves to avoid paying their share of taxes is a heavier tax burden on the rest of our honest constituents who are playing by the rules. to address this problem, the treasury department recently issued new rules to stop large corporations from simply changing their post office box to avoid paying u.s. taxes. could my constituents imagine simply changing their post office box address to eliminate their federal taxes? of course not. because they can't. but somehow multinational companies, which seem to have more rights than american citizens, can. now, you would think the american congress would support the efforts of the american president to stop american companies from not paying the taxes here in america. but, mr. speaker, you would be wrong. the majority is threatening to stop the treasury from advancing these types of commonsense rules to make multinational corporations pay their fair share of u.s. taxes just like everyone else. wouldn't our time be better spent and served if my republican colleagues held hearings--and passed bills--to stop companies from moving their jobs and profits overseas? democrats stand ready to work with them to enact commonsense policies to close the loopholes in our tax code that encourage companies to send their profits and their jobs overseas. unfortunately, we will have to wait for another day before the majority is serious about working together to make our tax system fairer for working people. but let me be clear. americans will not wait any longer. they demand that we act to close these loopholes to ensure that american corporations don't cheat the system to try to avoid paying their fair share of taxes here in the united states, letting the little guy have a greater burden in their absence. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, i am proud to have a gentlemen here to speak on behalf of my bill who has been a strong leader in bringing integrity to the irs. i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from nebraska (mr. smith). mr. smith of nebraska. mr. speaker, we are at a crossroads with our tax system. our tax code is outdated, overly complicated, and the irs has proven that it, in and of itself, is in need of serious reform. here is an opportunity for us to work together. from the opening remarks of my colleague across the aisle, i am not sure if that is an attitude of cooperation, but certainly this is a bill we can work together on, i would hope. our tax code was last updated in 1986, a generation ago. it is increasingly burdensome in this global 21st century economy. american taxpayers need a simpler code that they can easily comply with. finally, they deserve an accountable and consistent irs which provides exceptional taxpayer customer service. it is long past time for the status quo to change on these problems. we need tax reform. this is why i stand in support of my colleague's bill, the ensuring integrity in the irs workforce act. the legislation would prohibit the irs from rehiring any individual who was previously employed by the irs, but fired for cause. this is inconsistent and unacceptable behavior from an agency which requires the highest standard of tax compliance from taxpayers. the irs should apply the same rigorous standard inside the agency itself. [[page h1902]] mr. speaker, i wish we didn't need an act of congress such as this, but, apparently, we do. i urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, i have a friend and colleague here today who has fought daily for years for hardworking taxpayers across america and for his home district. i am proud to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. sessions). mr. sessions. mr. speaker, i want to thank the gentlewoman from hamlin county, south dakota, a very dear friend not only of every member of congress, but, in particular, a great representative representing south dakota at a time when south dakota needs not only strong representation, but a strong voice. i want to thank the young congresswoman for bringing this legislation to the floor today. mr. speaker, today is quite simple. the united states congress has a say in the matter about how our government is run and the conduct of the government. the internal revenue service has, for quite some time, been at odds, i believe, not only with their mission statement, but also at odds with their duty to publicly serve, provide information, and to do the things that enable taxpayers, who want to follow the law and need to follow the law, to comply respectfully. the internal revenue service, over the last few years, has run afoul, i believe, of the american people because the commonsense obligations that they have have not been met. today we are here on the floor with congresswoman noem to talk about h.r. 3724 that prohibits the commissioner of the irs from rehiring any employee who was involuntarily--that means forced--out or involuntarily separated from service for misconduct at the internal revenue service. the treasury inspector general for tax administration reported in february 2015 that the irs had rehired those employees who had been fired from the service for misconduct, hundreds of former employees who were terminated for well-documented conduct or performance issues. in fact, the irs rehired 141 former employees who had substantial tax issues. that means they were not paying their own tax bills. mr. speaker, if we were going to hire a person in our office, we would attempt to gain information about that employee. yesterday, as we were talking about this on the rule, a fellow colleague said: what about your own employees? do you make sure they pay their taxes? i said: that would be a good question. no, i don't ask that question. but i would not have any idea what the real answer was--the truth--if an employee did not tell me the truth. the irs does have the answer. they know who is paying their taxes, and they know why they fired an employee, mr. speaker. we are here saying that the internal revenue service should not rehire these employees who were unfaithful, unfaithful to their job and unfaithful to the american taxpayer. one hundred forty-one employees who substantially did not pay their taxes represent 60 percent of all terminated for misconduct. i think i know why: because the internal revenue service at the highest levels allows this to go on, and then they rehire the employees who didn't even follow the law. mr. speaker, that is not just misconduct. that is another level giving them an opportunity that a normal taxpayer would not have to get away with not paying their own taxes. other misconduct issues of rehiring employees include accessing taxpayer information improperly without authorization, falsification of official forms, unacceptable behavior and performance, and abuse of irs leave and property policies while on public time. mr. speaker, congresswoman noem is doing the right thing and so is the house of representatives. i would like to see this be a bipartisan issue, not a partisan issue. we need the irs. we need them to do a good job. but if this were at the federal bureau of investigation, would we allow that to happen? if this were at the cia, would we allow that to happen? the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman from texas an additional 30 seconds. mr. sessions. if this were at the department of justice, would we allow that to happen? why is this not a bipartisan issue? why can't we get together and say: mr. koskinen, you are the commissioner of the irs. we respectfully would like to see you correct what you are doing. we are not on a witch hunt. we have the facts of the case, and we believe the right thing to do is to offer some remedy. that is why republicans are on the floor today, and that is why our young congresswoman is leading this charge. i stand behind her. i voted for the rule, and i am going to vote for this. it does the right thing. i thank the gentlewoman for the time. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i yield myself 30 seconds. mr. speaker, i would just add to that list of the gentleman from texas: if it were congress, would we allow this to happen? mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, we have another colleague here on the floor today who serves on the ways and means committee and has diligently worked on irs issues and has been a leader on bringing some clarity to the situations that we deal with in trying to bring integrity to the irs. i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from ohio (mr. renacci). mr. renacci. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of h.r. 3724, the ensuring integrity in the irs workforce act of 2015, a bill sponsored by my good friend and colleague, representative kristi noem of south dakota. as the previous colleague said, this should be a bipartisan issue. this is an american issue. i spent most of my life in the business world. i have owned and operated over 60 different businesses, employed over 3,000 people, and created thousands of new jobs. throughout my 30-year business career, i have had the privilege of hiring many new, talented individuals. when it comes to hiring at the irs, the treasury inspector general stated, ``selecting the best candidates for employment is essential to providing the best service to america's taxpayers, maintaining public trust in tax administration, and safeguarding taxpayer's rights and privacy.'' however, the inspector general report from december 2014 found that the irs fell short of that standard. last year the irs hired hundreds of employees who were terminated for misconduct. those serious offenses included willful failure to file tax returns, unauthorized access to taxpayer information, falsification of official forms, and abuse of irs leave and property policies. {time} 0930 as a businessman, but more importantly as a representative of the american taxpayer, i find this ig report inexcusable. it seems obvious to me, but not once did i rehire someone in the real world--in the real world--who i had previously fired for misconduct. the irs needs to earn the trust of hardworking american taxpayers. rehiring employees who were fired for these serious offenses further erodes that trust. h.r. 3724 directly addresses this issue. it prohibits the irs from rehiring employees that were fired for misconduct. this is common sense. as a former businessowner, i know it is a very difficult decision to let someone go, but rehiring an individual who was asked to leave due to gross misconduct would be insulting to other employees who have faithfully served the business, and would present a significant risk to the health of the organization and its customers. the ig report found the irs doesn't take those risks seriously. in fact, ``irs officials stated that prior conduct and performance issues do not play a significant role in deciding the candidates who are best qualified for hiring.'' because the irs hasn't taken [[page h1903]] those risks seriously, this straightforward, commonsense legislation is needed to restore accountability and trust in the irs. i would like to commend mrs. noem for her leadership on this legislation. i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i yield myself 30 seconds. mr. speaker, it appears that america will have to continue to wait for action to stop companies from shifting american jobs overseas and stopping corporate tax dodgers. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. kelly). mr. kelly of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 3724. i would think as we look around the country right now, the integrity of what our government is and how our voters are represented and our citizens are represented, is really the case here. i thank the gentlewoman for bringing such a commonsense piece of legislation forward because we know in this town there is nothing less common than common sense. the faith and trust of the american people is based on their belief that the people who work for them are acting in their best interest, always acting in their best interest--the interest of the american people. not in their personal interest, but in the interest of the american people. we find out that there are folks who are working on behalf of the american people, but they have somehow betrayed that faith and that trust. and folks have lost confidence in their government. they have lost confidence because of things that happened, not things that were imagined, not some whimsical idea that somehow we can get at somebody for doing this. there is no agency that is feared more in this country than the irs. the question is: why would they be so feared? because they can completely shut you down, they can freeze your bank account, they can make you stay up late at night worrying about what is going to happen. when you get that letter from the irs, the next thing you do is contact an attorney to represent you because you don't want to make a mistake, you just don't want to do it. but then you find out that within the irs, people working for that agency, but, more importantly, working for the people of the united states, have violated that trust. these are substantiated results. this is not somebody's idea or way of getting back at somebody. this is removing bad apples and saying: you have violated, you have betrayed the trust of the american people, you are going to leave the agency, but, more importantly, you are never coming back in. this isn't any way to somehow get back at a political party or get back at anybody. this is a fact that if we cannot restore the confidence the american people have in us--their faith and their trust--why are we here? why do we go through elections? i don't come here to represent my ideas and my beliefs. i come here to represent the values and beliefs of pennsylvania's third congressional district. that is 705,687 americans, not republicans, not democrats, not libertarians, not independents, but americans. this piece of legislation takes into account that these are wrongdoers. these are not people who we want to associate ourselves with. these are people who have used the power of their office or of their position to somehow work against the very people who employ them. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. mr. kelly of pennsylvania. i would just say, at this moment in our history, i thank the gentlewoman for standing up for every hardworking american taxpayer and doing the best we can to restore the faith and confidence of the american people that they can trust who it is that they elect to represent them and they can trust us to make sure that wrongdoers are punished and, once are asked to leave, are not allowed to come back in. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i would inquire how much time is remaining on both sides. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from new york has 24\1/2\ minutes remaining. the gentlewoman from south dakota has 15\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz). mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i appreciate mrs. noem and her drive to address this very important issue. i believe that the overwhelming majority of the people who work at the irs are good, hardworking, patriotic people who want to do the right thing. i have a serious problem with management and i have a serious problem with the head of the irs, but on this issue, this is just unbelievable that we can't come to a conclusive and absolute 100 percent agreement. all we are asking for is that the bad apples, the people who will disturb what is going on in the workplace, who aren't going to act in the best interest of the united states of america, that they be excluded from participation. one of the things that is fascinating, mr. speaker, as we look at this, is in response to the independent review that was done of the irs and their hiring practices. and the question here is: should we go back and review the personnel employment file prior to rehiring somebody? this is what they said: ``additionally, while it did find that a review of performance and conduct issues could be accomplished earlier in the process, the department of treasury, the office of personnel management, and the internal revenue service believed that it was not feasible to move the review of these issues earlier in the hiring process. this action would greatly increase the cost of hiring, likely increase cycle time beyond the presidential mandate of 80 days, require additional resources, and not likely yield a reasonable return on investment.'' come on. come on. are you kidding me? how long could it possibly take to actually go back and review somebody's performance reviews, look back at their employment history, and see if they have been acting in the best interest of the united states of america? clearly, in the examples that are there, there are people that willfully don't even file their own tax returns, there are people that are doing some bad, stupid stuff. they don't think they have the time and resources to look at it in advance; we have to actually pass a piece of legislation requiring this? that seems entirely reasonable. it is not overly burdensome. here you have an organization, the irs, that can actually destroy somebody's life by a mere letter showing up in your mailbox, and they can't even take the time to look at somebody's employment history, somebody who has already worked at the irs? that is how absurd this organization is, and that is why this piece of legislation is so easy to understand, it is so easy to vote for. it is not a partisan issue. this is just saying: do you know what? for all the good people who work at the irs, let's make sure that the new people who come on, or the rehires who come on, in this case, are actually addressed and we look at their information prior to hiring. it is that simple. that is why i am in favor of this bill. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i yield myself 10 seconds. i am still waiting for a bill to keep american jobs in america and not export them overseas through the tax code. i will continue to wait for that bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, today, we are talking about a bill that will bring integrity to the irs, which will better serve our taxpayers into the future. i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana (mr. scalise). mr. scalise. mr. speaker, i really want to thank the gentlewoman from south dakota for her leadership in bringing this bill forward. mr. speaker, this bill is about restoring trust. this bill is about holding the irs accountable. here we are, in a week where americans had to file their tax returns. and so often, just the letters i-r-s send a chilling effect through people when they hear those [[page h1904]] letters. yet, you look at the arrogance over at the irs, just the attitude that they have and the disdain it seems that they have towards the very people who pay their bills--the taxpayers. here you have a case where people who have been fired by the irs for abusing their positions are actually being rehired back to the irs. again, this is the kind of disdain that disgusts people as they fear the irs. the irs ought to have the same fear towards the people who pay their salaries as people get when they get that letter from the irs. mr. speaker, we have had inspector general reports in the treasury department. the inspector general found over 140 irs agents aren't even accurate in their taxes. the very people who are responsible for auditing american citizens aren't even paying their own taxes. this is the kind of disregard for the american people that we are seeing over at the irs, and it is time to rein it in. it is time to bring some accountability and transparency back to the irs. who is afraid of that? what is so wrong with saying: if somebody has been fired for cause over at the irs, with the access they have to such sensitive personal information of taxpayers, why should they be rehired back? it is just basic common sense that if somebody has abused their position at the irs, enough is enough, and they shouldn't be able to return and have access to that sensitive information anymore. i want to applaud, again, the gentlewoman from south dakota for bringing this commonsense bill forward. i would urge adoption later on when we have this vote on the house floor. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. bishop). mr. bishop of michigan. mr. speaker, i want to begin by thanking my friend from south dakota for her leadership in holding the irs accountable for what we are seeing today. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of h.r. 3724, the ensuring integrity in the irs workforce act, to join in the outrage with my colleagues today on what we are seeing at the irs. with tax day hitting earlier this week, i think this is an ideal time to highlight the need for continued oversight and, perhaps, ramped-up oversight of the internal revenue service. last february, the treasury inspector general for tax administration reported that the irs had a tendency to rehire former employees with serious misconduct and performance issues. in their review, they found more than 100 former employees were rehired by the irs despite having significant performance and misconduct problems, like willfully failing to file tax returns: a rather important thing for most of us, but apparently not for irs employees. mr. speaker, the families in my district and i are 100 percent fed up with adhering to a standard that the irs doesn't even hold their own employees to. we simply will not tolerate the rehiring of incompetent individuals who fail to do their job in the first place. it is time to put a leash on the irs and prevent taxpayers from further double standards and further abuse. i strongly urge my colleagues to join me in voting for h.r. 3724. again, i thank my colleague from south dakota for her excellent leadership on this. i look forward to open debate and voting on this matter as soon as possible. {time} 0945 mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i yield myself 30 seconds. no disrespect to the sponsor of this bill whatsoever. i have great admiration for her, as she knows, but i believe that this bill could have been taken up on the consent calendar, quite frankly, with all of this discussion about the support on both sides. the reality is, though, that we are using precious time here on the floor on an issue that, as i say, could have been on the consent calendar. we are not addressing the real issue of concern to the american people, which is of the continuing loss of jobs here in america because of our tax code, which we refuse to fix, that is shifting jobs and american corporations overseas to inversion and also shifting american jobs overseas because of those inversions. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. crowley. i yield myself an additional 15 seconds. mr. speaker, we are not having a hearing on this. we are not doing anything here on the floor to address this issue. instead, we are taking up issues that, quite frankly, could have been on the consent calendar. i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, i have no further requests for time, and i am ready to close. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. i believe this should be the beginning and not the end of a discussion on how to best plug the giant corporate loopholes that are allowing companies to skip out on paying the same taxes that all of our constituents have to pay. this is one of the many major issues this congress should undertake; but, instead, we are all too busy governing by press releases. this congress has done nothing to address the zika virus, which could be a threat to all women who are pregnant or who are looking to become pregnant; but we have this consent bill here on the floor for debate. this congress has done nothing to address the crisis of lead in our drinking water--a crisis vividly on display in flint but one that lurks in the pipes of hundreds of cities and towns across our great land; yet we have this consent bill here on the calendar for debate. this congress hasn't even attempted to pass a budget for our country--the majority has not proposed a budget for our country--which is one of the most basic functions we can do as an institution to make sure we make the necessary investments possible while also getting our economic house in order; yet we have what i would consider to be a consent calendar bill here on the floor today, taking up an hour's debate. but we will always have time for message bills. sure, they don't create a job for an unemployed person in new york or in flint or in houston or in l.a., and they don't increase the take-home pay of any underpaid worker or make college more affordable for middle class kids or strengthen social security for our seniors of today and tomorrow, but they will sound great on talk radio tonight and over the weekend-- we are going after the irs again. they don't even deal with the tax code even though this bill is advertised as the republicans' idea of tax reform. it does not reform the tax code in any way, shape, or form, but that is what they portray it as. let me explain something about the tax code to my republican colleagues. our tax code is inefficient. you see that when large corporations are paying less tax than the employees who work for them. it is overly complicated. you see that when multinational corporations avoid paying the same taxes as our constituents back home have to pay simply by their hiring expensive lawyers that our constituents, quite frankly, cannot afford. it is unfair. you see that when corporations can dodge paying their fair share of taxes by simply switching their post office boxes to foreign countries--something our neighbors back home, if they attempted to do, would be arrested for, for tax evasion, but not corporations. individuals, if you do that, you are arrested for tax evasion, but not an american corporation; yet my republican colleagues continue to refuse to address this issue. maybe more importantly than anything else, it does not promote job growth here in the united states. you see this when congress refuses to repeal the tax breaks for companies to fire their workers here and move their jobs overseas. this congress must tackle these serious issues, but we are not doing that today. we continue to wait for legislation--for a hearing--on these important issues. democrats stand ready to work with you all, my republican colleagues, on commonsense legislation that plugs the corporate tax loopholes that are literally draining the funds our country needs in order to function properly. democrats stand ready to work with you to fix the tax code that is not only inefficient, not only complicated, not [[page h1905]] only unfair, but that does not promote job growth here in the united states. that is something we want to work with you on in a bipartisan way. unfortunately, we have to continue to wait for another day before the majority is serious about working together, in a bipartisan way, to make our tax system fairer for all working men and women in the united states. let me be clear, once again, that the american people will not wait any longer. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. we have heard repeatedly from my colleague on the other side of the aisle about why we should not be spending time on this topic today, about why we shouldn't have dedicated an hour's worth of debate to making sure that we talk about h.r. 3724, ensuring integrity in the irs workforce act. i think he has forgotten about what kind of information the people of this country turn over to the irs. they turn over their social security numbers, their financial information; a lot of the security that they have for their families, their homes, and their businesses they completely trust the irs to take care of, to protect, and to make sure that they use in the correct manner so that they might abide by the law and pay their taxes like honest, hardworking americans do. to say that we shouldn't spend time in making sure that criminals and people who are fired for misconduct don't have access to that information, to me, is silly. that is exactly what our job is. the irs needs integrity, and we are here to bring it today. mr. speaker, the white house has issued a veto threat against this bill. they said that the irs would be forced to fire people, because of this bill, if it were signed into law. i read the white house's statement of administration policy on my bill, and the statement reads that it is unnecessary because current irs processes already ensure that the agency does not rehire former employees who have significant conduct issues. i guess the white house didn't read the report, for the inspector general expressed concerns that the irs continues to hire individuals who have significant prior conduct and performance issues even after the agency supposedly made upgrades to its hiring practices. i remind you, mr. speaker, that the inspector general's review of former employees who were fired for serious misconduct and who were then rehired included employees with histories of fraud, a falsification of documents, workplace disruption, absence, and an unauthorized accessing of taxpayer information. the inspector general identified approximately 140 individuals who are currently, today, with the irs who had been previously fired for cause. we are talking about an agency that employs 80,000 people. surely, it can find 140 people who haven't committed fraud or falsified documents. mr. speaker, the inspector general recommended that the irs reassess its hiring practices to determine in what part of the process it should fully vet candidates in terms of their prior performance. in fact, the irs was given an opportunity to fully respond to the inspector general's report. in its response, the agency insisted its processes were sufficient. yet, mr. speaker, the agency still only begins to vet the candidates for employment only after the entire hiring process is completed and after a formal offer of employment has been extended. so, regardless of any changes the irs has made to its hiring practices, the inspector general said he remains very concerned because irs documents indicate it is hiring individuals who have significant prior conduct and performance issues. mr. speaker, because the irs hasn't taken action is why we are here today. this bill is simple. it just says that the irs cannot rehire employees who have been fired for misconduct. it is something the irs should have taken action on; and because they didn't, that is why we are here today. it is our job to protect the taxpayers and to make sure their information is safe with the agency that they, by law, need to turn over to the irs. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. all time for debate has expired. pursuant to house resolution 688, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the passage of the bill. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mrs. noem. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________",39824

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 4890. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bishop of Michigan). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 688 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 4890. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. {time} 0957 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 4890) to impose a ban on the payment of bonuses to employees of the Internal Revenue Service until the Secretary of the Treasury develops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy, with Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am before the House today--really, before the Nation--on behalf of all of those frustrated taxpayers who have spent a great part of the last month, if not months before, in preparing their taxes in what is an increasingly complex Code. While we have a mission to simplify that Code, the fact of the matter is they have to deal with the challenges that they face today. One of the agencies that they interact with or hope to interact with when they have questions is something called the Internal Revenue Service. I want to focus on that third word--``service''--because the idea here is we don't have some oversight agency, and we don't have some agency whose obligation and purpose in life is to make it harder on the average hardworking taxpayers, who are supporting the government with the money that they earn; it is to be a service--to use their resources to help the hardworking Americans who must pay taxes--and to simplify the process, particularly when they have questions of a very, very complex Code and its requirements that are being put on each and every one of them. When we talk about service, what we need to see is a pattern; and what we see is a pattern by which, unfortunately, the service of the IRS is deteriorating rapidly. Let me give you the facts, and I am talking about what they call the answer time. When an individual gets on the telephone because he is frustrated and he calls the IRS and says, ``I have a question,'' this year, the IRS estimates it will receive 48.4 million calls with people asking for assistance. Do you know how many they will answer? Sixteen million. That means that 32 million [[Page H1906]] taxpayers will call the service, and their calls will go unanswered. {time} 1000 What kind of private entity could survive in this day and age if that was the kind of service that they were providing? What we are seeing is that this is going in a backwards fashion. If you are able to get through and finally talk to somebody, the wait times a few years ago were 18.7 minutes. Well, how many people who are working at home, have other jobs, are doing things have 18.7 minutes just to wait for a phone call to be answered on an issue that they already have anxiety about? Well, those were the good old days, Mr. Chairman, 18.7 minutes, because today it is 34.4 minutes. If you are one of the lucky 30 percent who even gets their call answered, you wait 34.4 minutes. It even gets better because what the IRS has implemented is a program now called a courtesy disconnect. Well, if that isn't the most oxymoronic thing that I have heard--a courtesy disconnect. In other words, we are going to tell you ahead of time, when you call, we are going to disconnect your call right away because we are going to tell you you are not going to be able to get through in time, so don't waste your time trying to contact the IRS. Now, that just exacerbates the level of frustration. So what do we do about it? What is a solution? Let me tell you, Mr. Chairman, this isn't something that the Republicans on this side of the aisle have sat and said: Oh, let's go get the IRS. Mr. Chairman, the GAO, which has overlooked this agency for, now, 3 straight years has been calling on the IRS to do something very simple. What they say is create a strategy and a plan to do a better job of answering those calls, of being responsive to those very taxpayers that your service requires you to do so. Just create a plan. It is that simple. The GAO issued recommendations to the IRS that they first outline a strategy that defines appropriate levels of telephone and correspondence service and wait time lists and get specific steps to manage service based on an assessment of timeframes, demand capabilities, and resources. Just tell us how you can do it better. Number two was direct the appropriate officials to systematically and empirically compare its telephone service to the best in business to identify gaps between actual and desired performance; in other words, see how it is being done in other places and aspire to do it as well. Well, as I said again, go back to the private sector. I imagine the people aren't making 60 percent of the people that call, they don't even answer it. Lastly, just improve taxpayer service by requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a comprehensive customer service strategy. That is what the GAO asked them to do. This recommendation has been repeated year after year. Unfortunately, the response of the IRS to the GAO was that their existing efforts were sufficient. They have yet to devise this plan. Mr. Chairman, you tell me, when 60 percent of the calls are unanswered and those that are calling have wait times of over 35 minutes, tell me where that is sufficient. And therein lies the heart of the problem, the complete unwillingness to do a simple issue and to be responsive. Now, there are other reasons, perhaps, that the IRS is diverting the very resources that have been put in by this Congress to support taxpayer services. In fact, the commitment to those taxpayer services has gone down dramatically each and every year: In 2013, they put $190 million into ensuring that there were appropriate taxpayer services; and then, in 2014, they decreased it to $183 million to ensure that there were appropriate taxpayer services; and then, in 2015, they put $45 million into it. So at a time when the GAO is telling them to do better, they are speaking with their own specific acts to say: We think it is sufficient. And not only do we think it is sufficient, we are actually pulling resources away from relations to the very taxpayers that we have an obligation to service. Mr. Chairman, the bill is really quite simple, and it is in response to that continuing unresponsiveness of those who manage the IRS. It is simply saying to do what you have been requested to do. Now, despite three GAO reports and continuing oversight by Congress, the refusal to be responsive to that, we looked and said a very simple thing. It says do not pay bonuses to the employees until you have fulfilled the very simple requirement of coming up with this plan. Now, somebody might say to me: Well, that is outrageous. Put new obligations on the IRS. They have not done it in 3 years. But guess who has? The Department of Labor does it. The Department of Agriculture does it. The Department of Education does it. The Office of Management and Budget does it. Each and every one of them, I would suggest to you, Mr. Chairman, probably have a lot less interaction with everyday Americans, but they have taken the time to put together that plan. So there is a template. We are not asking a whole lot. It has been specific, laid out in the GAO report, simply to do that. So we are asking very simply in the bill, do your job; and until you have done that job, which other agencies are very capable of doing, no bonuses get paid. It doesn't say no bonuses get paid at all. In fact, this is not antiworker. In fact, hardworking people at the IRS--and there are many--they can get rewarded for appropriate work that they do. But don't pay those bonuses until you, management, answer to them why you won't do the service agreement or service plan. You tell your employees why you won't do it. Don't go blaming it on somebody else. That is the very simple request that we have, which is to make the plan before you write the bonuses. Mr. Chairman, that is not asking for much. It is certainly not asking for much on behalf of the frustrated taxpayers of the United States who are seeing a demonstrated inability to communicate with the very agency that is responsible for helping them solve the questions that they have with respect to the complexities of the Tax Code. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to continuing to debate this issue. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. What we are facing today is the worst kind of demagoguery, and really it descends to propaganda. Look, the reason the phones aren't being answered is because the Republican majority has failed to answer to its responsibilities. The appropriations have been going down. The last 5 years, the budget cut for IRS has been close to $1 billion. So you try to hide from your failure and you point your finger everyplace except where it belongs--yourselves. You want to say no bonuses to the 80,000 people because this House majority has failed to meet its basic responsibility, and that is to fund so that there can be adequate resources to answer the phones. You are the ones who have shut it off. So the problem is not a lack of strategy; it is a lack of resources. The House Republicans are trying to pass the buck because they are not providing the bucks necessary for adequate taxpayer services. We had this chart yesterday, and here it is again. This shows, in the yellow, the amount of resources. In the blue, it shows the average time to answer the phone. As the resources have gone down, the time it takes has gone up. That is a simple fact. The only time that changed was when this institution provided some adequate resources, and so the time to answer the phones went down. Now you are back at it again, diminishing the resources, and you are essentially blaming the 80,000 people who don't get the adequate resources to do their jobs. Now you say let's have a plan. There is already a system, but you don't provide the resources to carry it out. You are saying come up with a plan that will be looked at and approved by the inspector general that doesn't have that responsibility. So that is why the White House stands in opposition, and I read: ``Legislation constraining the IRS's ability to retain and recruit highly qualified employees is not needed and could be counterproductive to the Service's mission.'' [[Page H1907]] So I am going to point out other things you haven't done. Mr. Crowley laid them out very, very well. This place, under your leadership, has been bankrupt in terms of addressing the critical needs of the budget, the problems in Flint, the problems faced by Puerto Rico, the problems faced by thousands of people because of Zika. So you come here and you say, well, the IRS isn't doing its job. You are not doing your job. Don't go after an agency for not being able to answer the telephone when you essentially are cutting the lines of resources. It is outrageous. It is outrageous, and I think the people will know. I say this to my constituents. When you call up and it takes hours, call up your local Member of Congress, especially if he or she a member of the majority here. Call them up. If they don't answer the phone, try email. And if there is no response, call one of us who are working to provide the adequate resources for the IRS to answer the phones, and we will try to find a way for you to communicate with your Member, if that person has failed to meet his responsibilities. The blame is on your doorstep. Don't try to shift it. I reserve the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Poe of Texas). Members of the House are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair and not to each other in the second person. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) control the remainder of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey will be recognized. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy). Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and his work. Mr. Chairman, every year the American people pay their taxes; and every year to do that, they have to deal with an agency that is inept and increasingly unethical. You can't make this stuff up. The IRS failed to answer 8 million calls during tax season last year. Yet, over a short 5-year period, they handed out nearly $6 million in bonuses to themselves. {time} 1015 Just to make this clear, that means the IRS can't take the taxpayers' phone calls, but they sure as heck can take the taxpayers' money for their bonuses. Or how about this? The inspector general found that nearly 1,600 IRS employees willfully avoided paying their own taxes over a 10-year period; yet, we trust these same people to collect taxes from their fellow citizens. How is it that the agency charged with collecting taxes employs people who don't pay their own taxes and that agency does nothing about it? Now, it doesn't stop there. The IRS has a slush fund of money it collects from fees that it uses however it wants. No accountability. No transparency. Meanwhile, about 500 IRS employees have been fired for misconduct, such as snooping on private taxpayers' information; yet, they have been hired back again. The IRS selectively targeted for sanctions taxpayers who donated to Romney, intimidated nonprofit citizen groups, and sent out millions in potentially fraudulent tax refunds all in the past few years alone. You wonder why American people don't trust their government. Now, Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to look at these bills on the floor. We are not trying to make some partisan statement here. We just want our government to work for the people and work well. But, to do that, we can't leave the IRS the way it has been. We had bills yesterday on the floor by Congressmen Jason Smith and David Rouzer that put an end to the slush funds and to make sure the people working at the IRS actually paid their taxes, and today we are going to pass more bills by Kristi Noem and Pat Meehan to stop the IRS from hiring people who can't be trusted and to fix the agency's absolutely terrible customer service. These are good bills. They are smart bills. Frankly, they are bills that make you wonder how any reasonable person could ever vote against them. But I forgot how irrational some people could be. Just a few days ago the Obama administration said they were against all four of these bills. Really? They are against accountability? They are against IRS agency employees paying their taxes? They want the IRS to fail to answer the vast majority of customer service calls? They want to rehire bad employees? I couldn't understand it. Frankly, the administration's statement didn't clear things up either. The Office of Management and Budget actually said this: ``These bills would impose unnecessary constraints on the Internal Revenue Service's . . . operations . . .''. Now, let me get one thing out of the way. The administration is worried about imposing constraints on the IRS, but it has no problem imposing constraints and regulations on small businesses, energy producers, manufacturers, to the point that it is driving them out of business. That shows you how backwards this administration's priorities are. The IRS targets conservative groups, fails at basic tasks, and employs people who don't pay their own taxes. But the people who are trying to earn an honest living and power their homes and produce products right here in America? The administration thinks they are the problem. They think they need to be regulated. That is wrong. That is not what our country stands for, and it is not what this majority is going to stand for either. But there is another principle here. The House is not trying to write some laws and impose some rules on the IRS just because. We are trying to restrain government because unaccountable and unelected bureaucrats have shown that they can't be trusted with the power they have been given. When you say ``IRS,'' I can assure you that the last words people think of are honest, fair, transparent, or even trustworthy. That is not how our government should be, especially the arm of government entrusted with collecting our taxes. Because when people can't trust that their government is treating them fairly, they lose faith in politics. They become cynical, and it increases the divisions within our country. Now, good government shouldn't be a one-party issue. I love the debates about how small or how large government should be or how high or how low taxes should be. But we can and we should agree that government should do its job well without abusing the trust of the American people. That should never be a one-party argument. That is what these bills are about. That is what this debate is about. The American people are watching, Mr. Chairman, and they want us to make our choice, good government or bad. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I have to respond to the previous speaker, whose simplistic analysis has been exposed during this Presidential election. We have selective memories. That is our problem, because how can you come before the American people, Mr. Chairman, and explain how X amount of IRS workers have not paid their taxes? We all want everybody to pay their taxes because when insufficient revenue is in the coffers, we can't pay our bills. But if the truth be known and we didn't have selective memory, when you point out how many people in the IRS of the 80,000 employees-- 1,500--haven't paid their taxes or are in default of their taxes, the gentleman fails to mention that one of the biggest culprits in not paying their taxes is the very House of Representatives. My Lord. Five percent of the Members default on their taxes. Now, what about us and our responsibilities? We are the guardians. We are the guardians. We are the protectors of the taxpayers. Beware, taxpayers. Beware. I have a great deal of respect--and I hope I have proven it in the past--for the gentleman who has introduced this legislation, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan). I just think we are off on the wrong foot on this one. In your support for the bill, H.R. 4890, you claim to be concerned about IRS customer service. This bill would prohibit any bonuses being paid to IRS [[Page H1908]] employees until the agency comes up with a customer service strategy approved by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Customer service is critical. But how can you come here and complain about customer service when you have cut the IRS budget $1 billion in the last 5 years? That is 13,000 fewer full-time employees. At the same time--listen to this, Mr. Chairman--there have been 9 million more tax returns being filed. Think about that just for a second: 9 million more tax returns, 13,000 fewer employees, $1 billion less in appropriations. I mean, that is not rocket science. It is simply arithmetic. Your budgets have consistently starved the IRS of the resources it needs to do its job, and, true to form, this bill expressly forbids any additional appropriations to carry out this mandate. Here is the reality. The IRS customer service didn't decline because of lazy employees. It declined because of significant budget cuts. This year, thanks to an extra $290 million in funding, it has rebounded to about mediocre, still a disservice to many Americans who need help. So I agree with the ranking member when he says to look in the mirror and you will see who is responsible. Instead of helping the struggling people of Puerto Rico or Flint, Michigan, or passing a budget--tax day passed a few days ago--this Congress is fiddling with weakening the IRS. You can't deny that all these attempts to harm the IRS are really harming taxpayers. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, let me take a moment just to be responsive to a couple of things. In point of fact, I don't think that I could have had a better setup for the real issues here than the very arguments that have been made by my colleagues because, in fact, when you look behind what is actually going on, you see the scheme that is taking place here, which has put the IRS and the service that it gives to taxpayers right in the middle of the conflict. What they have done is created a circumstance in which, if you purposely starve the very thing that will relate to the taxpayers, you can get the taxpayers worked up to come back to scream for more money for the Service: Let's blame this on Congress. But let's talk about what is actually going on here, Mr. Chairman. There may have been budget cuts, as there have been budget cuts all across the government. One of the budget cuts related to the $50 million that the IRS has used for conferences. And so, just like every other agency in government, just like the 14 percent cut we have taken in our own offices, there have been cuts at a time in which our government doesn't have money. But that is not the issue. Because what has happened here has been the diverting of funding. What nobody is saying is that this same agency has been hit with $1.7 billion of diverted expenditure to service the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law that was pushed on us and pushed on all America; $1.7 billion has been diverted, will be dedicated this year, but never accounted for when that program was created. They put this responsibility, another unfunded mandate put on the agency by this law. What they have done is divert the attention. Take the resources away and then use it as a way to compel to see if we can force Congress to get pulled into this debate. Our thing is very, very simple. Again, it is not a funding issue. It is a service issue. We are not getting into that with this particular bill. It is a very simple thing that says: Create a plan for how you do it. I am glad that the gentleman from New Jersey, who I respect enormously, has been able, Mr. Chair, to touch on the very point that was also made, this idea that somehow we have been unresponsive and starved this agency. Mr. Chairman, $290 million just sent purposely for this issue, $290 million. So in addition to saying to give us a plan, we are saying: Here is $290 million of focused funding to say this is behind the plan. Tell us how you are going to use it. This whole thing is a smokescreen on the part of the other side to create the tension when, in fact, we are asking for a very simple thing that we have already funded. Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers at this time. I reserve the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Kelly of Mississippi). The Committee will rise informally.

Now, there are other reasons, perhaps, that the IRS is diverting the very resources that have been put in by this Congress to support taxpayer services. In fact, the commitment to those taxpayer services has gone down dramatically each and every year: In 2013, they put $190 million into ensuring that there were appropriate taxpayer services; and then, in 2014, they decreased it to $183 million to ensure that there were appropriate taxpayer services; and then, in 2015, they put $45 million into it. So at a time when the GAO is telling them to do better, they are speaking with their own specific acts to say: We think it is sufficient. And not only do we think it is sufficient, we are actually pulling resources away from relations to the very taxpayers that we have an obligation to service. Mr. Chairman, the bill is really quite simple, and it is in response to that continuing unresponsiveness of those who manage the IRS. It is simply saying to do what you have been requested to do. Now, despite three GAO reports and continuing oversight by Congress, the refusal to be responsive to that, we looked and said a very simple thing. It says do not pay bonuses to the employees until you have fulfilled the very simple requirement of coming up with this plan. Now, somebody might say to me: Well, that is outrageous. Put new obligations on the IRS. They have not done it in 3 years. But guess who has? The Department of Labor does it. The Department of Agriculture does it. The Department of Education does it. The Office of Management and Budget does it. Each and every one of them, I would suggest to you, Mr. Chairman, probably have a lot less interaction with everyday Americans, but they have taken the time to put together that plan. So there is a template. We are not asking a whole lot. It has been specific, laid out in the GAO report, simply to do that. So we are asking very simply in the bill, do your job; and until you have done that job, which other agencies are very capable of doing, no bonuses get paid. It doesn't say no bonuses get paid at all. In fact, this is not antiworker. In fact, hardworking people at the IRS--and there are many--they can get rewarded for appropriate work that they do. But don't pay those bonuses until you, management, answer to them why you won't do the service agreement or service plan. You tell your employees why you won't do it. Don't go blaming it on somebody else. That is the very simple request that we have, which is to make the plan before you write the bonuses. Mr. Chairman, that is not asking for much. It is certainly not asking for much on behalf of the frustrated taxpayers of the United States who are seeing a demonstrated inability to communicate with the very agency that is responsible for helping them solve the questions that they have with respect to the complexities of the Tax Code. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to continuing to debate this issue. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. What we are facing today is the worst kind of demagoguery, and really it descends to propaganda. Look, the reason the phones aren't being answered is because the Republican majority has failed to answer to its responsibilities. The appropriations have been going down. The last 5 years, the budget cut for IRS has been close to $1 billion. So you try to hide from your failure and you point your finger everyplace except where it belongs--yourselves. You want to say no bonuses to the 80,000 people because this House majority has failed to meet its basic responsibility, and that is to fund so that there can be adequate resources to answer the phones. You are the ones who have shut it off. So the problem is not a lack of strategy; it is a lack of resources. The House Republicans are trying to pass the buck because they are not providing the bucks necessary for adequate taxpayer services. We had this chart yesterday, and here it is again. This shows, in the yellow, the amount of resources. In the blue, it shows the average time to answer the phone. As the resources have gone down, the time it takes has gone up. That is a simple fact. The only time that changed was when this institution provided some adequate resources, and so the time to answer the phones went down. Now you are back at it again, diminishing the resources, and you are essentially blaming the 80,000 people who don't get the adequate resources to do their jobs. Now you say let's have a plan. There is already a system, but you don't provide the resources to carry it out. You are saying come up with a plan that will be looked at and approved by the inspector general that doesn't have that responsibility. So that is why the White House stands in opposition, and I read: ``Legislation constraining the IRS's ability to retain and recruit highly qualified employees is not needed and could be counterproductive to the Service's mission.'' [[Page H1907]] So I am going to point out other things you haven't done. Mr. Crowley laid them out very, very well. This place, under your leadership, has been bankrupt in terms of addressing the critical needs of the budget, the problems in Flint, the problems faced by Puerto Rico, the problems faced by thousands of people because of Zika. So you come here and you say, well, the IRS isn't doing its job. You are not doing your job. Don't go after an agency for not being able to answer the telephone when you essentially are cutting the lines of resources. It is outrageous. It is outrageous, and I think the people will know. I say this to my constituents. When you call up and it takes hours, call up your local Member of Congress, especially if he or she a member of the majority here. Call them up. If they don't answer the phone, try email. And if there is no response, call one of us who are working to provide the adequate resources for the IRS to answer the phones, and we will try to find a way for you to communicate with your Member, if that person has failed to meet his responsibilities. The blame is on your doorstep. Don't try to shift it. I reserve the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Poe of Texas). Members of the House are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair and not to each other in the second person. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) control the remainder of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey will be recognized. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy). Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and his work. Mr. Chairman, every year the American people pay their taxes; and every year to do that, they have to deal with an agency that is inept and increasingly unethical. You can't make this stuff up. The IRS failed to answer 8 million calls during tax season last year. Yet, over a short 5-year period, they handed out nearly $6 million in bonuses to themselves. {time} 1015 Just to make this clear, that means the IRS can't take the taxpayers' phone calls, but they sure as heck can take the taxpayers' money for their bonuses. Or how about this? The inspector general found that nearly 1,600 IRS employees willfully avoided paying their own taxes over a 10-year period; yet, we trust these same people to collect taxes from their fellow citizens. How is it that the agency charged with collecting taxes employs people who don't pay their own taxes and that agency does nothing about it? Now, it doesn't stop there. The IRS has a slush fund of money it collects from fees that it uses however it wants. No accountability. No transparency. Meanwhile, about 500 IRS employees have been fired for misconduct, such as snooping on private taxpayers' information; yet, they have been hired back again. The IRS selectively targeted for sanctions taxpayers who donated to Romney, intimidated nonprofit citizen groups, and sent out millions in potentially fraudulent tax refunds all in the past few years alone. You wonder why American people don't trust their government. Now, Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to look at these bills on the floor. We are not trying to make some partisan statement here. We just want our government to work for the people and work well. But, to do that, we can't leave the IRS the way it has been. We had bills yesterday on the floor by Congressmen Jason Smith and David Rouzer that put an end to the slush funds and to make sure the people working at the IRS actually paid their taxes, and today we are going to pass more bills by Kristi Noem and Pat Meehan to stop the IRS from hiring people who can't be trusted and to fix the agency's absolutely terrible customer service. These are good bills. They are smart bills. Frankly, they are bills that make you wonder how any reasonable person could ever vote against them. But I forgot how irrational some people could be. Just a few days ago the Obama administration said they were against all four of these bills. Really? They are against accountability? They are against IRS agency employees paying their taxes? They want the IRS to fail to answer the vast majority of customer service calls? They want to rehire bad employees? I couldn't understand it. Frankly, the administration's statement didn't clear things up either. The Office of Management and Budget actually said this: ``These bills would impose unnecessary constraints on the Internal Revenue Service's . . . operations . . .''. Now, let me get one thing out of the way. The administration is worried about imposing constraints on the IRS, but it has no problem imposing constraints and regulations on small businesses, energy producers, manufacturers, to the point that it is driving them out of business. That shows you how backwards this administration's priorities are. The IRS targets conservative groups, fails at basic tasks, and employs people who don't pay their own taxes. But the people who are trying to earn an honest living and power their homes and produce products right here in America? The administration thinks they are the problem. They think they need to be regulated. That is wrong. That is not what our country stands for, and it is not what this majority is going to stand for either. But there is another principle here. The House is not trying to write some laws and impose some rules on the IRS just because. We are trying to restrain government because unaccountable and unelected bureaucrats have shown that they can't be trusted with the power they have been given. When you say ``IRS,'' I can assure you that the last words people think of are honest, fair, transparent, or even trustworthy. That is not how our government should be, especially the arm of government entrusted with collecting our taxes. Because when people can't trust that their government is treating them fairly, they lose faith in politics. They become cynical, and it increases the divisions within our country. Now, good government shouldn't be a one-party issue. I love the debates about how small or how large government should be or how high or how low taxes should be. But we can and we should agree that government should do its job well without abusing the trust of the American people. That should never be a one-party argument. That is what these bills are about. That is what this debate is about. The American people are watching, Mr. Chairman, and they want us to make our choice, good government or bad. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I have to respond to the previous speaker, whose simplistic analysis has been exposed during this Presidential election. We have selective memories. That is our problem, because how can you come before the American people, Mr. Chairman, and explain how X amount of IRS workers have not paid their taxes? We all want everybody to pay their taxes because when insufficient revenue is in the coffers, we can't pay our bills. But if the truth be known and we didn't have selective memory, when you point out how many people in the IRS of the 80,000 employees-- 1,500--haven't paid their taxes or are in default of their taxes, the gentleman fails to mention that one of the biggest culprits in not paying their taxes is the very House of Representatives. My Lord. Five percent of the Members default on their taxes. Now, what about us and our responsibilities? We are the guardians. We are the guardians. We are the protectors of the taxpayers. Beware, taxpayers. Beware. I have a great deal of respect--and I hope I have proven it in the past--for the gentleman who has introduced this legislation, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan). I just think we are off on the wrong foot on this one. In your support for the bill, H.R. 4890, you claim to be concerned about IRS customer service. This bill would prohibit any bonuses being paid to IRS [[Page H1908]] employees until the agency comes up with a customer service strategy approved by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Customer service is critical. But how can you come here and complain about customer service when you have cut the IRS budget $1 billion in the last 5 years? That is 13,000 fewer full-time employees. At the same time--listen to this, Mr. Chairman--there have been 9 million more tax returns being filed. Think about that just for a second: 9 million more tax returns, 13,000 fewer employees, $1 billion less in appropriations. I mean, that is not rocket science. It is simply arithmetic. Your budgets have consistently starved the IRS of the resources it needs to do its job, and, true to form, this bill expressly forbids any additional appropriations to carry out this mandate. Here is the reality. The IRS customer service didn't decline because of lazy employees. It declined because of significant budget cuts. This year, thanks to an extra $290 million in funding, it has rebounded to about mediocre, still a disservice to many Americans who need help. So I agree with the ranking member when he says to look in the mirror and you will see who is responsible. Instead of helping the struggling people of Puerto Rico or Flint, Michigan, or passing a budget--tax day passed a few days ago--this Congress is fiddling with weakening the IRS. You can't deny that all these attempts to harm the IRS are really harming taxpayers. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, let me take a moment just to be responsive to a couple of things. In point of fact, I don't think that I could have had a better setup for the real issues here than the very arguments that have been made by my colleagues because, in fact, when you look behind what is actually going on, you see the scheme that is taking place here, which has put the IRS and the service that it gives to taxpayers right in the middle of the conflict. What they have done is created a circumstance in which, if you purposely starve the very thing that will relate to the taxpayers, you can get the taxpayers worked up to come back to scream for more money for the Service: Let's blame this on Congress. But let's talk about what is actually going on here, Mr. Chairman. There may have been budget cuts, as there have been budget cuts all across the government. One of the budget cuts related to the $50 million that the IRS has used for conferences. And so, just like every other agency in government, just like the 14 percent cut we have taken in our own offices, there have been cuts at a time in which our government doesn't have money. But that is not the issue. Because what has happened here has been the diverting of funding. What nobody is saying is that this same agency has been hit with $1.7 billion of diverted expenditure to service the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law that was pushed on us and pushed on all America; $1.7 billion has been diverted, will be dedicated this year, but never accounted for when that program was created. They put this responsibility, another unfunded mandate put on the agency by this law. What they have done is divert the attention. Take the resources away and then use it as a way to compel to see if we can force Congress to get pulled into this debate. Our thing is very, very simple. Again, it is not a funding issue. It is a service issue. We are not getting into that with this particular bill. It is a very simple thing that says: Create a plan for how you do it. I am glad that the gentleman from New Jersey, who I respect enormously, has been able, Mr. Chair, to touch on the very point that was also made, this idea that somehow we have been unresponsive and starved this agency. Mr. Chairman, $290 million just sent purposely for this issue, $290 million. So in addition to saying to give us a plan, we are saying: Here is $290 million of focused funding to say this is behind the plan. Tell us how you are going to use it. This whole thing is a smokescreen on the part of the other side to create the tension when, in fact, we are asking for a very simple thing that we have already funded. Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers at this time. I reserve the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Kelly of Mississippi). The Committee will rise informally. The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Holding) assumed the chair. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1905-H1908] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BAN ON IRS BONUSES UNTIL SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY DEVELOPS COMPREHENSIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE STRATEGY General Leave Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 4890. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bishop of Michigan). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 688 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 4890. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. {time} 0957 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 4890) to impose a ban on the payment of bonuses to employees of the Internal Revenue Service until the Secretary of the Treasury develops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy, with Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am before the House today--really, before the Nation--on behalf of all of those frustrated taxpayers who have spent a great part of the last month, if not months before, in preparing their taxes in what is an increasingly complex Code. While we have a mission to simplify that Code, the fact of the matter is they have to deal with the challenges that they face today. One of the agencies that they interact with or hope to interact with when they have questions is something called the Internal Revenue Service. I want to focus on that third word--``service''--because the idea here is we don't have some oversight agency, and we don't have some agency whose obligation and purpose in life is to make it harder on the average hardworking taxpayers, who are supporting the government with the money that they earn; it is to be a service--to use their resources to help the hardworking Americans who must pay taxes--and to simplify the process, particularly when they have questions of a very, very complex Code and its requirements that are being put on each and every one of them. When we talk about service, what we need to see is a pattern; and what we see is a pattern by which, unfortunately, the service of the IRS is deteriorating rapidly. Let me give you the facts, and I am talking about what they call the answer time. When an individual gets on the telephone because he is frustrated and he calls the IRS and says, ``I have a question,'' this year, the IRS estimates it will receive 48.4 million calls with people asking for assistance. Do you know how many they will answer? Sixteen million. That means that 32 million [[Page H1906]] taxpayers will call the service, and their calls will go unanswered. {time} 1000 What kind of private entity could survive in this day and age if that was the kind of service that they were providing? What we are seeing is that this is going in a backwards fashion. If you are able to get through and finally talk to somebody, the wait times a few years ago were 18.7 minutes. Well, how many people who are working at home, have other jobs, are doing things have 18.7 minutes just to wait for a phone call to be answered on an issue that they already have anxiety about? Well, those were the good old days, Mr. Chairman, 18.7 minutes, because today it is 34.4 minutes. If you are one of the lucky 30 percent who even gets their call answered, you wait 34.4 minutes. It even gets better because what the IRS has implemented is a program now called a courtesy disconnect. Well, if that isn't the most oxymoronic thing that I have heard--a courtesy disconnect. In other words, we are going to tell you ahead of time, when you call, we are going to disconnect your call right away because we are going to tell you you are not going to be able to get through in time, so don't waste your time trying to contact the IRS. Now, that just exacerbates the level of frustration. So what do we do about it? What is a solution? Let me tell you, Mr. Chairman, this isn't something that the Republicans on this side of the aisle have sat and said: Oh, let's go get the IRS. Mr. Chairman, the GAO, which has overlooked this agency for, now, 3 straight years has been calling on the IRS to do something very simple. What they say is create a strategy and a plan to do a better job of answering those calls, of being responsive to those very taxpayers that your service requires you to do so. Just create a plan. It is that simple. The GAO issued recommendations to the IRS that they first outline a strategy that defines appropriate levels of telephone and correspondence service and wait time lists and get specific steps to manage service based on an assessment of timeframes, demand capabilities, and resources. Just tell us how you can do it better. Number two was direct the appropriate officials to systematically and empirically compare its telephone service to the best in business to identify gaps between actual and desired performance; in other words, see how it is being done in other places and aspire to do it as well. Well, as I said again, go back to the private sector. I imagine the people aren't making 60 percent of the people that call, they don't even answer it. Lastly, just improve taxpayer service by requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a comprehensive customer service strategy. That is what the GAO asked them to do. This recommendation has been repeated year after year. Unfortunately, the response of the IRS to the GAO was that their existing efforts were sufficient. They have yet to devise this plan. Mr. Chairman, you tell me, when 60 percent of the calls are unanswered and those that are calling have wait times of over 35 minutes, tell me where that is sufficient. And therein lies the heart of the problem, the complete unwillingness to do a simple issue and to be responsive. Now, there are other reasons, perhaps, that the IRS is diverting the very resources that have been put in by this Congress to support taxpayer services. In fact, the commitment to those taxpayer services has gone down dramatically each and every year: In 2013, they put $190 million into ensuring that there were appropriate taxpayer services; and then, in 2014, they decreased it to $183 million to ensure that there were appropriate taxpayer services; and then, in 2015, they put $45 million into it. So at a time when the GAO is telling them to do better, they are speaking with their own specific acts to say: We think it is sufficient.

Now, good government shouldn't be a one-party issue. I love the debates about how small or how large government should be or how high or how low taxes should be. But we can and we should agree that government should do its job well without abusing the trust of the American people. That should never be a one-party argument. That is what these bills are about. That is what this debate is about. The American people are watching, Mr. Chairman, and they want us to make our choice, good government or bad. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I have to respond to the previous speaker, whose simplistic analysis has been exposed during this Presidential election. We have selective memories. That is our problem, because how can you come before the American people, Mr. Chairman, and explain how X amount of IRS workers have not paid their taxes? We all want everybody to pay their taxes because when insufficient revenue is in the coffers, we can't pay our bills. But if the truth be known and we didn't have selective memory, when you point out how many people in the IRS of the 80,000 employees-- 1,500--haven't paid their taxes or are in default of their taxes, the gentleman fails to mention that one of the biggest culprits in not paying their taxes is the very House of Representatives. My Lord. Five percent of the Members default on their taxes. Now, what about us and our responsibilities? We are the guardians. We are the guardians. We are the protectors of the taxpayers. Beware, taxpayers. Beware. I have a great deal of respect--and I hope I have proven it in the past--for the gentleman who has introduced this legislation, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan). I just think we are off on the wrong foot on this one. In your support for the bill, H.R. 4890, you claim to be concerned about IRS customer service. This bill would prohibit any bonuses being paid to IRS [[Page H1908]] employees until the agency comes up with a customer service strategy approved by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Customer service is critical. But how can you come here and complain about customer service when you have cut the IRS budget $1 billion in the last 5 years? That is 13,000 fewer full-time employees. At the same time--listen to this, Mr. Chairman--there have been 9 million more tax returns being filed. Think about that just for a second: 9 million more tax returns, 13,000 fewer employees, $1 billion less in appropriations. I mean, that is not rocket science. It is simply arithmetic. Your budgets have consistently starved the IRS of the resources it needs to do its job, and, true to form, this bill expressly forbids any additional appropriations to carry out this mandate. Here is the reality. The IRS customer service didn't decline because of lazy employees. It declined because of significant budget cuts. This year, thanks to an extra $290 million in funding, it has rebounded to about mediocre, still a disservice to many Americans who need help. So I agree with the ranking member when he says to look in the mirror and you will see who is responsible. Instead of helping the struggling people of Puerto Rico or Flint, Michigan, or passing a budget--tax day passed a few days ago--this Congress is fiddling with weakening the IRS. You can't deny that all these attempts to harm the IRS are really harming taxpayers. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, let me take a moment just to be responsive to a couple of things. In point of fact, I don't think that I could have had a better setup for the real issues here than the very arguments that have been made by my colleagues because, in fact, when you look behind what is actually going on, you see the scheme that is taking place here, which has put the IRS and the service that it gives to taxpayers right in the middle of the conflict. What they have done is created a circumstance in which, if you purposely starve the very thing that will relate to the taxpayers, you can get the taxpayers worked up to come back to scream for more money for the Service: Let's blame this on Congress. But let's talk about what is actually going on here, Mr. Chairman. There may have been budget cuts, as there have been budget cuts all across the government. One of the budget cuts related to the $50 million that the IRS has used for conferences. And so, just like every other agency in government, just like the 14 percent cut we have taken in our own offices, there have been cuts at a time in which our government doesn't have money. But that is not the issue. Because what has happened here has been the diverting of funding. What nobody is saying is that this same agency has been hit with $1.7 billion of diverted expenditure to service the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law that was pushed on us and pushed on all America; $1.7 billion has been diverted, will be dedicated this year, but never accounted for when that program was created. They put this responsibility, another unfunded mandate put on the agency by this law. What they have done is divert the attention. Take the resources away and then use it as a way to compel to see if we can force Congress to get pulled into this debate. Our thing is very, very simple. Again, it is not a funding issue. It is a service issue. We are not getting into that with this particular bill. It is a very simple thing that says: Create a plan for how you do it. I am glad that the gentleman from New Jersey, who I respect enormously, has been able, Mr. Chair, to touch on the very point that was also made, this idea that somehow we have been unresponsive and starved this agency. Mr. Chairman, $290 million just sent purposely for this issue, $290 million. So in addition to saying to give us a plan, we are saying: Here is $290 million of focused funding to say this is behind the plan. Tell us how you are going to use it. This whole thing is a smokescreen on the part of the other side to create the tension when, in fact, we are asking for a very simple thing that we have already funded. Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers at this time. I reserve the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Kelly of Mississippi). The Committee will rise informally.

sixteen million. that means that 32 million [[page h1906]] taxpayers will call the service, and their calls will go unanswered. {time} 1000 what kind of private entity could survive in this day and age if that was the kind of service that they were providing? what we are seeing is that this is going in a backwards fashion. if you are able to get through and finally talk to somebody, the wait times a few years ago were 18.7 minutes. well, how many people who are working at home, have other jobs, are doing things have 18.7 minutes just to wait for a phone call to be answered on an issue that they already have anxiety about? well, those were the good old days, mr. chairman, 18.7 minutes, because today it is 34.4 minutes. if you are one of the lucky 30 percent who even gets their call answered, you wait 34.4 minutes. it even gets better because what the irs has implemented is a program now called a courtesy disconnect. well, if that isn't the most oxymoronic thing that i have heard--a courtesy disconnect. in other words, we are going to tell you ahead of time, when you call, we are going to disconnect your call right away because we are going to tell you you are not going to be able to get through in time, so don't waste your time trying to contact the irs. now, that just exacerbates the level of frustration. so what do we do about it? what is a solution? let me tell you, mr. chairman, this isn't something that the republicans on this side of the aisle have sat and said: oh, let's go get the irs. mr. chairman, the gao, which has overlooked this agency for, now, 3 straight years has been calling on the irs to do something very simple. what they say is create a strategy and a plan to do a better job of answering those calls, of being responsive to those very taxpayers that your service requires you to do so. just create a plan. it is that simple. the gao issued recommendations to the irs that they first outline a strategy that defines appropriate levels of telephone and correspondence service and wait time lists and get specific steps to manage service based on an assessment of timeframes, demand capabilities, and resources. just tell us how you can do it better. number two was direct the appropriate officials to systematically and empirically compare its telephone service to the best in business to identify gaps between actual and desired performance; in other words, see how it is being done in other places and aspire to do it as well. well, as i said again, go back to the private sector. i imagine the people aren't making 60 percent of the people that call, they don't even answer it. lastly, just improve taxpayer service by requiring the secretary of the treasury to develop a comprehensive customer service strategy. that is what the gao asked them to do. this recommendation has been repeated year after year. unfortunately, the response of the irs to the gao was that their existing efforts were sufficient. they have yet to devise this plan. mr. chairman, you tell me, when 60 percent of the calls are unanswered and those that are calling have wait times of over 35 minutes, tell me where that is sufficient. and therein lies the heart of the problem, the complete unwillingness to do a simple issue and to be responsive. now, there are other reasons, perhaps, that the irs is diverting the very resources that have been put in by this congress to support taxpayer services. in fact, the commitment to those taxpayer services has gone down dramatically each and every year: in 2013, they put $190 million into ensuring that there were appropriate taxpayer services; and then, in 2014, they decreased it to $183 million to ensure that there were appropriate taxpayer services; and then, in 2015, they put $45 million into it. so at a time when the gao is telling them to do better, they are speaking with their own specific acts to say: we think it is sufficient. and not only do we think it is sufficient, we are actually pulling resources away from relations to the very taxpayers that we have an obligation to service. mr. chairman, the bill is really quite simple, and it is in response to that continuing unresponsiveness of those who manage the irs. it is simply saying to do what you have been requested to do. now, despite three gao reports and continuing oversight by congress, the refusal to be responsive to that, we looked and said a very simple thing. it says do not pay bonuses to the employees until you have fulfilled the very simple requirement of coming up with this plan. now, somebody might say to me: well, that is outrageous. put new obligations on the irs. they have not done it in 3 years. but guess who has? the department of labor does it. the department of agriculture does it. the department of education does it. the office of management and budget does it. each and every one of them, i would suggest to you, mr. chairman, probably have a lot less interaction with everyday americans, but they have taken the time to put together that plan. so there is a template. we are not asking a whole lot. it has been specific, laid out in the gao report, simply to do that. so we are asking very simply in the bill, do your job; and until you have done that job, which other agencies are very capable of doing, no bonuses get paid. it doesn't say no bonuses get paid at all. in fact, this is not antiworker. in fact, hardworking people at the irs--and there are many--they can get rewarded for appropriate work that they do. but don't pay those bonuses until you, management, answer to them why you won't do the service agreement or service plan. you tell your employees why you won't do it. don't go blaming it on somebody else. that is the very simple request that we have, which is to make the plan before you write the bonuses. mr. chairman, that is not asking for much. it is certainly not asking for much on behalf of the frustrated taxpayers of the united states who are seeing a demonstrated inability to communicate with the very agency that is responsible for helping them solve the questions that they have with respect to the complexities of the tax code. mr. chairman, i look forward to continuing to debate this issue. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. levin. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. what we are facing today is the worst kind of demagoguery, and really it descends to propaganda. look, the reason the phones aren't being answered is because the republican majority has failed to answer to its responsibilities. the appropriations have been going down. the last 5 years, the budget cut for irs has been close to $1 billion. so you try to hide from your failure and you point your finger everyplace except where it belongs--yourselves. you want to say no bonuses to the 80,000 people because this house majority has failed to meet its basic responsibility, and that is to fund so that there can be adequate resources to answer the phones. you are the ones who have shut it off. so the problem is not a lack of strategy; it is a lack of resources. the house republicans are trying to pass the buck because they are not providing the bucks necessary for adequate taxpayer services. we had this chart yesterday, and here it is again. this shows, in the yellow, the amount of resources. in the blue, it shows the average time to answer the phone. as the resources have gone down, the time it takes has gone up. that is a simple fact. the only time that changed was when this institution provided some adequate resources, and so the time to answer the phones went down. now you are back at it again, diminishing the resources, and you are essentially blaming the 80,000 people who don't get the adequate resources to do their jobs. now you say let's have a plan. there is already a system, but you don't provide the resources to carry it out. you are saying come up with a plan that will be looked at and approved by the inspector general that doesn't have that responsibility. so that is why the white house stands in opposition, and i read: ``legislation constraining the irs's ability to retain and recruit highly qualified employees is not needed and could be counterproductive to the service's mission.'' [[page h1907]] so i am going to point out other things you haven't done. mr. crowley laid them out very, very well. this place, under your leadership, has been bankrupt in terms of addressing the critical needs of the budget, the problems in flint, the problems faced by puerto rico, the problems faced by thousands of people because of zika. so you come here and you say, well, the irs isn't doing its job. you are not doing your job. don't go after an agency for not being able to answer the telephone when you essentially are cutting the lines of resources. it is outrageous. it is outrageous, and i think the people will know. i say this to my constituents. when you call up and it takes hours, call up your local member of congress, especially if he or she a member of the majority here. call them up. if they don't answer the phone, try email. and if there is no response, call one of us who are working to provide the adequate resources for the irs to answer the phones, and we will try to find a way for you to communicate with your member, if that person has failed to meet his responsibilities. the blame is on your doorstep. don't try to shift it. i reserve the balance of my time. the acting chair (mr. poe of texas). members of the house are reminded to address their remarks to the chair and not to each other in the second person. mr. levin. mr. chair, i ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from new jersey (mr. pascrell) control the remainder of my time. the acting chair. the gentleman from new jersey will be recognized. mr. meehan. mr. chair, i yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from california (mr. mccarthy). mr. mccarthy. mr. chairman, i thank the gentleman for yielding and his work. mr. chairman, every year the american people pay their taxes; and every year to do that, they have to deal with an agency that is inept and increasingly unethical. you can't make this stuff up. the irs failed to answer 8 million calls during tax season last year. yet, over a short 5-year period, they handed out nearly $6 million in bonuses to themselves. {time} 1015 just to make this clear, that means the irs can't take the taxpayers' phone calls, but they sure as heck can take the taxpayers' money for their bonuses. or how about this? the inspector general found that nearly 1,600 irs employees willfully avoided paying their own taxes over a 10-year period; yet, we trust these same people to collect taxes from their fellow citizens. how is it that the agency charged with collecting taxes employs people who don't pay their own taxes and that agency does nothing about it? now, it doesn't stop there. the irs has a slush fund of money it collects from fees that it uses however it wants. no accountability. no transparency. meanwhile, about 500 irs employees have been fired for misconduct, such as snooping on private taxpayers' information; yet, they have been hired back again. the irs selectively targeted for sanctions taxpayers who donated to romney, intimidated nonprofit citizen groups, and sent out millions in potentially fraudulent tax refunds all in the past few years alone. you wonder why american people don't trust their government. now, mr. chairman, i urge members to look at these bills on the floor. we are not trying to make some partisan statement here. we just want our government to work for the people and work well. but, to do that, we can't leave the irs the way it has been. we had bills yesterday on the floor by congressmen jason smith and david rouzer that put an end to the slush funds and to make sure the people working at the irs actually paid their taxes, and today we are going to pass more bills by kristi noem and pat meehan to stop the irs from hiring people who can't be trusted and to fix the agency's absolutely terrible customer service. these are good bills. they are smart bills. frankly, they are bills that make you wonder how any reasonable person could ever vote against them. but i forgot how irrational some people could be. just a few days ago the obama administration said they were against all four of these bills. really? they are against accountability? they are against irs agency employees paying their taxes? they want the irs to fail to answer the vast majority of customer service calls? they want to rehire bad employees? i couldn't understand it. frankly, the administration's statement didn't clear things up either. the office of management and budget actually said this: ``these bills would impose unnecessary constraints on the internal revenue service's . . . operations . . .''. now, let me get one thing out of the way. the administration is worried about imposing constraints on the irs, but it has no problem imposing constraints and regulations on small businesses, energy producers, manufacturers, to the point that it is driving them out of business. that shows you how backwards this administration's priorities are. the irs targets conservative groups, fails at basic tasks, and employs people who don't pay their own taxes. but the people who are trying to earn an honest living and power their homes and produce products right here in america? the administration thinks they are the problem. they think they need to be regulated. that is wrong. that is not what our country stands for, and it is not what this majority is going to stand for either. but there is another principle here. the house is not trying to write some laws and impose some rules on the irs just because. we are trying to restrain government because unaccountable and unelected bureaucrats have shown that they can't be trusted with the power they have been given. when you say ``irs,'' i can assure you that the last words people think of are honest, fair, transparent, or even trustworthy. that is not how our government should be, especially the arm of government entrusted with collecting our taxes. because when people can't trust that their government is treating them fairly, they lose faith in politics. they become cynical, and it increases the divisions within our country. now, good government shouldn't be a one-party issue. i love the debates about how small or how large government should be or how high or how low taxes should be. but we can and we should agree that government should do its job well without abusing the trust of the american people. that should never be a one-party argument. that is what these bills are about. that is what this debate is about. the american people are watching, mr. chairman, and they want us to make our choice, good government or bad. mr. pascrell. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. chairman, i have to respond to the previous speaker, whose simplistic analysis has been exposed during this presidential election. we have selective memories. that is our problem, because how can you come before the american people, mr. chairman, and explain how x amount of irs workers have not paid their taxes?

There are mandates within the Affordable Care Act which necessitate, obviously, the involvement of the IRS agency. So any attempts to make it or create a slush fund in people's minds is totally, totally inaccurate. That is not the issue. The issue is we have cut $5 billion. This year we restored $290 million. Again, do the math. We have 13,000 less employees. So that means a lot of those 13,000 less employees came to the end, perhaps, of their career, but were never replaced. It had nothing to do with the budget. It was beyond the budget, even, or within the budget. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers at this time, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Seven former IRS Commissioners wrote, and we need to take a look at it because obviously they weren't all Democrats and they weren't all Republicans, but seven former IRS Commissioners have said: ``Over the last 50 years, none of us has ever witnessed anything like what has happened to the IRS appropriations over the last 5 years and impact these appropriations reductions are having on our tax system.'' The percentage of callers able to reach a live person at the IRS in the 2015 filing season was just 43 percent. The average wait time was 28 minutes. At one point during the filing season, the Taxpayer Protection Program line, which answers calls for victims of identity theft--a growing issue day by day--was not answering 90 percent of the calls. That is not acceptable to your side. It is certainly not acceptable to our side, but your solution is, by no means, the solution. If you were truly concerned about improving customer service at the IRS, you would fully fund the agency. And we would support that. Penalizing the IRS is misguided and, in the long run, the consequence hurts the taxpayer. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Kelly of Mississippi). Members are again reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, I want to once again actually appreciate the comments that were made by the other side in the entirety of this debate because they really speak to, in essence, what they are trying to do. [[Page H1909]] And I start again with this effectively unfunded mandate that was put on the IRS by the other side. They talk about funding. They gave them $1.7 billion of responsibility under the Affordable Care Act, but never a penny to pay for it. As my parents used to say when I was a kid: You should have thought about that when you did it. Where was the recognition that these responsibilities that you are putting on them, you have got to pay for them? We have seen costs rise exponentially in so many different factors, but that is the essence of what is being done here. So we are not going to pay for it, but let's create tension and anxiety at the one place where the taxpayers will uprise, because we will stop talking to them. That is the essence of what is being done here. Mr. Chairman, once again, we are not asking for anything radical in response. In fact, we have already responded quite appropriately by putting $290 million more into the very issue that is at stake here. All we are saying is: Come up with a plan. Show us how you are going to do it. Show us how, when 48 million people call you and ask for help with their taxes at a time when they don't have 34 minutes to wait on a phone, to be one of the lucky 30 percent that even get their phone call answered. Do what a number of other agencies already do, give us a plan on how you are going to improve that. It is that simple. Our purpose isn't to punish diligent IRS employees, but rather to compel management to finally put the taxpayers first and take the need to improve the customer service experience seriously. Upon learning that this legislation was in development, the IRS reported to the GAO that they have established a team to consider its customer service recommendations. How about that? After 3 years, no response. The IRS Commissioner himself says service is abysmal. And they say it has been satisfactory up to this point in time. But as soon as this legislation is introduced, we have customer service recommendations and a team being established. I don't think that is a coincidence. Passing the bill into law will ensure that the process continues in good faith. Mr. Chairman, Congress has a duty to oversee the IRS and ensure that it is meeting the needs of American taxpayers. When the IRS fails to meet those needs, it is up to Congress to act. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-49. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows: H.R. 4890 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. BAN ON IRS BONUSES UNTIL IRS DEVELOPS COMPREHENSIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE STRATEGY. (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary's delegate, may not pay a bonus, award, or similar cash payment to any employee of the Internal Revenue Service until the Secretary, or the Secretary's delegate, develops and submits to Congress a comprehensive customer service strategy that has been reviewed and approved by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Such strategy shall include-- (1) appropriate telephone and correspondence levels of service, which shall be based on service provided by the best in business and customer expectations; (2) a thorough assessment of which services the Internal Revenue Service can shift to self-service options; and (3) proposals to improve customer service in the short term (the current and following fiscal year), medium term (approximately three to five fiscal years), and long term (approximately ten fiscal years). (b) Progress Reports.--The Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary's delegate, shall submit reports to the Congress on the status of its customer service strategy and actions taken to improve customer service. Such reports shall be submitted on a semiannual basis until the comprehensive customer service strategy under subsection (a) is fully implemented. SEC. 2. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available to carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated or made available. The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in House Report 114- 503. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall be not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Meehan The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 114-503. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, line 23, strike ``or made available''. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 688, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a technical amendment to clarify section 2 of the bill. This section states that no additional funds are authorized or otherwise made available to carry out the requirement of this bill. The language in the amendment makes it abundantly clear that we are not authorizing a new appropriation here. The IRS needs to create a customer service agency. If they want to claim that they don't have enough money in the budget to be serving the taxpayers with an appropriate topnotch customer service strategy, then we are saying: Give us a plan to do so, and withhold the bonuses until you do so. It is very, very simple. This amendment makes a technical correction to make our intentions here crystal clear. The IRS doesn't need additional funding to make customer service the top priority when, in fact, it has already been given $290 million to do just this. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, once again, my friends on the other side of the aisle are cutting off their nose to spite their face: more mandates on the IRS with fewer resources and somehow expecting them to improve services. As I have said, the IRS is servicing 9 million more people with $1 billion less. This amendment would only exacerbate that problem. The words of the seven former IRS Commissioners ring out here. Why don't we just cut congressional office budgets by 17 percent, as we did with the IRS, and then mandate that we improve constituent services or increase our workloads? That doesn't make any sense either. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Sanford The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 114-503. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, after line 17, insert the following: [[Page H1910]] (c) Consultation With Taxpayer Advocate.--In developing the comprehensive customer service strategy pursuant to this section, the Secretary, or the Secretary's delegate, shall consult with the National Taxpayer Advocate. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 688, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I have a small but, I think, perfecting amendment that I think, whether Republican or Democrat, we can agree on. Because I think as Republicans and Democrats, we may have different perspectives on this equation, but we would agree that money is power and that the IRS has an immense amount of power, given the amount of money that it is, in essence, steward to and controls as money is moved from individuals across this country to the Federal Government. I think that we would agree that money without a plan is chaos. That is why in the military they have a five-paragraph order. That is why if you think about the business rule, you have a business plan. If you think about sports, you have got a game plan. You need to go through a planning process to effectively use money. I think we would agree that the government's role is to serve. I think it disturbed a lot of us that the Lincoln Memorial was closed back during the government shutdown. Some people saw that as a way of maximizing inconvenience for folks, as a way of highlighting some rule we agreed or disagreed on as opposed to, again, staying focused on this larger notion of service. So I applaud the overall work of this bill and what it is about. I think that there is a problem when wait times move up threefold over the last 5 years. I think that there is a problem with dropped calls and infinity holds and all the other things that people have seen come their way as a result of dysfunction at the IRS. We might see different remedies as to how we get there, but I think we would agree on those things. And so I applaud what is being done with this notion of saying: Let's hold on bonuses. Let's actually come up with a plan as we deal with how this additional $20 million is dispensed and used within the IRS. This amendment simply says that as you go in consultation with the Treasury, as you go in consultation with the IG, let's also include the National Taxpayer Advocate there at the IRS. Because I think it is important. You may deal with technology experts, you may deal with phone call experts, you may deal with taxation specialists, but to keep the bull's-eye the ultimate customer out there--and that is the taxpayer. Too often the taxpayer is indeed the forgotten man or forgotten women in this equation. The idea of consulting with the National Taxpayers Union as you formulate those plans, again, I think make this a simply perfecting amendment, as you listen to the different constituencies that will be dealt with in coming up with this plan. I think that perspective is key in holding the taxpayers' viewpoint to be vital in the creation of this plan. That is all the amendment does. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan). {time} 1045 Mr. MEEHAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chair, let me just take a moment to say that the National Taxpayer Advocate has a long history of not only working on behalf of taxpayers, but working with the IRS to improve customer service. I think having the National Taxpayer Advocate involved in this process of creating comprehensive service strategy will actually improve the final outcome. I thank the gentleman for taking his time not only to look at the totality of this bill, but to find a way to improve its implementation with that support. I support the addition, and I urge others to vote ``yes'' on the amendment. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, so let's get this amendment straight. This bill would have the IRS work with the National Taxpayer Advocate, in addition to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, as I read it correctly, in coming up with a customer service plan. Sounds good. However, you forget to mention one thing, Mr. Chairman, because the National Taxpayer Advocate and the Treasury Inspector General Tax Administrator have publicly stated, for the record, that the severe budget cuts enacted by the other side, Mr. Chairman, in Congress have forced the IRS to reduce its workforce, reduce training, reduce technology, and that these steps have weakened the ability to enforce the Nation's tax laws--is that what you are looking for?--and serve taxpayers effectively. They said it, I didn't. You can't make this stuff up. So, instead of forcing the IRS to work with the National Taxpayer Advocate, why don't we, in Congress, listen to them, and fund the IRS so it can do its job? This is the height of misdirection. I am only going by the words you have in this amendment. And I will tell you, they have made a statement very loud and clear to all of us. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Womack) having assumed the chair, Mr. Kelly of Mississippi, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4890) to impose a ban on the payment of bonuses to employees of the Internal Revenue Service until the Secretary of the Treasury develops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy, and, pursuant to House Resolution 688, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15- minute vote on passage of H.R. 4890 will be followed by a 5-minute vote on passage of H.R. 3724.

I think we would agree that the government's role is to serve. I think it disturbed a lot of us that the Lincoln Memorial was closed back during the government shutdown. Some people saw that as a way of maximizing inconvenience for folks, as a way of highlighting some rule we agreed or disagreed on as opposed to, again, staying focused on this larger notion of service. So I applaud the overall work of this bill and what it is about. I think that there is a problem when wait times move up threefold over the last 5 years. I think that there is a problem with dropped calls and infinity holds and all the other things that people have seen come their way as a result of dysfunction at the IRS. We might see different remedies as to how we get there, but I think we would agree on those things. And so I applaud what is being done with this notion of saying: Let's hold on bonuses. Let's actually come up with a plan as we deal with how this additional $20 million is dispensed and used within the IRS. This amendment simply says that as you go in consultation with the Treasury, as you go in consultation with the IG, let's also include the National Taxpayer Advocate there at the IRS. Because I think it is important. You may deal with technology experts, you may deal with phone call experts, you may deal with taxation specialists, but to keep the bull's-eye the ultimate customer out there--and that is the taxpayer. Too often the taxpayer is indeed the forgotten man or forgotten women in this equation. The idea of consulting with the National Taxpayers Union as you formulate those plans, again, I think make this a simply perfecting amendment, as you listen to the different constituencies that will be dealt with in coming up with this plan. I think that perspective is key in holding the taxpayers' viewpoint to be vital in the creation of this plan. That is all the amendment does. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan). {time} 1045 Mr. MEEHAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chair, let me just take a moment to say that the National Taxpayer Advocate has a long history of not only working on behalf of taxpayers, but working with the IRS to improve customer service. I think having the National Taxpayer Advocate involved in this process of creating comprehensive service strategy will actually improve the final outcome. I thank the gentleman for taking his time not only to look at the totality of this bill, but to find a way to improve its implementation with that support. I support the addition, and I urge others to vote ``yes'' on the amendment. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, so let's get this amendment straight. This bill would have the IRS work with the National Taxpayer Advocate, in addition to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, as I read it correctly, in coming up with a customer service plan. Sounds good. However, you forget to mention one thing, Mr. Chairman, because the National Taxpayer Advocate and the Treasury Inspector General Tax Administrator have publicly stated, for the record, that the severe budget cuts enacted by the other side, Mr. Chairman, in Congress have forced the IRS to reduce its workforce, reduce training, reduce technology, and that these steps have weakened the ability to enforce the Nation's tax laws--is that what you are looking for?--and serve taxpayers effectively. They said it, I didn't. You can't make this stuff up. So, instead of forcing the IRS to work with the National Taxpayer Advocate, why don't we, in Congress, listen to them, and fund the IRS so it can do its job? This is the height of misdirection. I am only going by the words you have in this amendment. And I will tell you, they have made a statement very loud and clear to all of us. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Womack) having assumed the chair, Mr. Kelly of Mississippi, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4890) to impose a ban on the payment of bonuses to employees of the Internal Revenue Service until the Secretary of the Treasury develops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy, and, pursuant to House Resolution 688, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, today, Thursday, April 21, 2016, I was unable to be present for the first recorded vote of the day. Had I been present, I would have voted ``no'' on rollcall vote No. 162 (on passage of H.R. 4890). ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1908-H1911] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BAN ON IRS BONUSES UNTIL SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY DEVELOPS COMPREHENSIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE STRATEGY The Committee resumed its sitting. {time} 1030 Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, just in response to my friend from the Keystone State, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act is not an IRS slush fund. There are mandates within the Affordable Care Act which necessitate, obviously, the involvement of the IRS agency. So any attempts to make it or create a slush fund in people's minds is totally, totally inaccurate. That is not the issue. The issue is we have cut $5 billion. This year we restored $290 million. Again, do the math. We have 13,000 less employees. So that means a lot of those 13,000 less employees came to the end, perhaps, of their career, but were never replaced. It had nothing to do with the budget. It was beyond the budget, even, or within the budget. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers at this time, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Seven former IRS Commissioners wrote, and we need to take a look at it because obviously they weren't all Democrats and they weren't all Republicans, but seven former IRS Commissioners have said: ``Over the last 50 years, none of us has ever witnessed anything like what has happened to the IRS appropriations over the last 5 years and impact these appropriations reductions are having on our tax system.'' The percentage of callers able to reach a live person at the IRS in the 2015 filing season was just 43 percent. The average wait time was 28 minutes. At one point during the filing season, the Taxpayer Protection Program line, which answers calls for victims of identity theft--a growing issue day by day--was not answering 90 percent of the calls. That is not acceptable to your side. It is certainly not acceptable to our side, but your solution is, by no means, the solution. If you were truly concerned about improving customer service at the IRS, you would fully fund the agency. And we would support that. Penalizing the IRS is misguided and, in the long run, the consequence hurts the taxpayer. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Kelly of Mississippi). Members are again reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, I want to once again actually appreciate the comments that were made by the other side in the entirety of this debate because they really speak to, in essence, what they are trying to do. [[Page H1909]] And I start again with this effectively unfunded mandate that was put on the IRS by the other side. They talk about funding. They gave them $1.7 billion of responsibility under the Affordable Care Act, but never a penny to pay for it. As my parents used to say when I was a kid: You should have thought about that when you did it. Where was the recognition that these responsibilities that you are putting on them, you have got to pay for them? We have seen costs rise exponentially in so many different factors, but that is the essence of what is being done here. So we are not going to pay for it, but let's create tension and anxiety at the one place where the taxpayers will uprise, because we will stop talking to them. That is the essence of what is being done here. Mr. Chairman, once again, we are not asking for anything radical in response. In fact, we have already responded quite appropriately by putting $290 million more into the very issue that is at stake here. All we are saying is: Come up with a plan. Show us how you are going to do it. Show us how, when 48 million people call you and ask for help with their taxes at a time when they don't have 34 minutes to wait on a phone, to be one of the lucky 30 percent that even get their phone call answered. Do what a number of other agencies already do, give us a plan on how you are going to improve that. It is that simple. Our purpose isn't to punish diligent IRS employees, but rather to compel management to finally put the taxpayers first and take the need to improve the customer service experience seriously. Upon learning that this legislation was in development, the IRS reported to the GAO that they have established a team to consider its customer service recommendations. How about that? After 3 years, no response. The IRS Commissioner himself says service is abysmal. And they say it has been satisfactory up to this point in time. But as soon as this legislation is introduced, we have customer service recommendations and a team being established. I don't think that is a coincidence. Passing the bill into law will ensure that the process continues in good faith. Mr. Chairman, Congress has a duty to oversee the IRS and ensure that it is meeting the needs of American taxpayers. When the IRS fails to meet those needs, it is up to Congress to act. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-49. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows: H.R. 4890 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. BAN ON IRS BONUSES UNTIL IRS DEVELOPS COMPREHENSIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE STRATEGY. (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary's delegate, may not pay a bonus, award, or similar cash payment to any employee of the Internal Revenue Service until the Secretary, or the Secretary's delegate, develops and submits to Congress a comprehensive customer service strategy that has been reviewed and approved by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Such strategy shall include-- (1) appropriate telephone and correspondence levels of service, which shall be based on service provided by the best in business and customer expectations; (2) a thorough assessment of which services the Internal Revenue Service can shift to self-service options; and (3) proposals to improve customer service in the short term (the current and following fiscal year), medium term (approximately three to five fiscal years), and long term (approximately ten fiscal years). (b) Progress Reports.--The Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary's delegate, shall submit reports to the Congress on the status of its customer service strategy and actions taken to improve customer service. Such reports shall be submitted on a semiannual basis until the comprehensive customer service strategy under subsection (a) is fully implemented. SEC. 2. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available to carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated or made available. The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in House Report 114- 503. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall be not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Meehan The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 114-503. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, line 23, strike ``or made available''. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 688, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a technical amendment to clarify section 2 of the bill. This section states that no additional funds are authorized or otherwise made available to carry out the requirement of this bill. The language in the amendment makes it abundantly clear that we are not authorizing a new appropriation here. The IRS needs to create a customer service agency. If they want to claim that they don't have enough money in the budget to be serving the taxpayers with an appropriate topnotch customer service strategy, then we are saying: Give us a plan to do so, and withhold the bonuses until you do so. It is very, very simple. This amendment makes a technical correction to make our intentions here crystal clear. The IRS doesn't need additional funding to make customer service the top priority when, in fact, it has already been given $290 million to do just this. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, once again, my friends on the other side of the aisle are cutting off their nose to spite their face: more mandates on the IRS with fewer resources and somehow expecting them to improve services. As I have said, the IRS is servicing 9 million more people with $1 billion less. This amendment would only exacerbate that problem. The words of the seven former IRS Commissioners ring out here. Why don't we just cut congressional office budgets by 17 percent, as we did with the IRS, and then mandate that we improve constituent services or increase our workloads? That doesn't make any sense either. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Sanford The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 114-503. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, after line 17, insert the following: [[Page H1910]] (c) Consultation With Taxpayer Advocate.--In developing the comprehensive customer service strategy pursuant to this section, the Secretary, or the Secretary's delegate, shall consult with the National Taxpayer Advocate. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 688, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I have a small but, I think, perfecting amendment that I think, whether Republican or Democrat, we can agree on. Because I think as Republicans and Democrats, we may have different perspectives on this equation, but we would agree that money is power and that the IRS has an immense amount of power, given the amount of money that it is, in essence, steward to and controls as money is moved from individuals across this country to the Federal Government. I think that we would agree that money without a plan is chaos. That is why in the military they have a five-paragraph order. That is why if you think about the business rule, you have a business plan. If you think about sports, you have got a game plan. You need to go through a planning process to effectively use money. I think we would agree that the government's role is to serve. I think it disturbed a lot of us that the Lincoln Memorial was closed back during the government shutdown.

Had I been present, I would have voted ``no'' on rollcall vote No. 162 (on passage of H.R. 4890). ____________________",package_114_168.csv,22839,22839,22908,"[congressional record volume 162, number 62 (thursday, april 21, 2016)] [house] [pages h1908-h1911] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] ban on irs bonuses until secretary of the treasury develops comprehensive customer service strategy the committee resumed its sitting. {time} 1030 mr. pascrell. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. chairman, just in response to my friend from the keystone state, the implementation of the affordable care act is not an irs slush fund. there are mandates within the affordable care act which necessitate, obviously, the involvement of the irs agency. so any attempts to make it or create a slush fund in people's minds is totally, totally inaccurate. that is not the issue. the issue is we have cut $5 billion. this year we restored $290 million. again, do the math. we have 13,000 less employees. so that means a lot of those 13,000 less employees came to the end, perhaps, of their career, but were never replaced. it had nothing to do with the budget. it was beyond the budget, even, or within the budget. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. meehan. mr. chairman, i have no other speakers at this time, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pascrell. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. seven former irs commissioners wrote, and we need to take a look at it because obviously they weren't all democrats and they weren't all republicans, but seven former irs commissioners have said: ``over the last 50 years, none of us has ever witnessed anything like what has happened to the irs appropriations over the last 5 years and impact these appropriations reductions are having on our tax system.'' the percentage of callers able to reach a live person at the irs in the 2015 filing season was just 43 percent. the average wait time was 28 minutes. at one point during the filing season, the taxpayer protection program line, which answers calls for victims of identity theft--a growing issue day by day--was not answering 90 percent of the calls. that is not acceptable to your side. it is certainly not acceptable to our side, but your solution is, by no means, the solution. if you were truly concerned about improving customer service at the irs, you would fully fund the agency. and we would support that. penalizing the irs is misguided and, in the long run, the consequence hurts the taxpayer. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair (mr. kelly of mississippi). members are again reminded to direct their remarks to the chair. mr. meehan. mr. chairman, i yield myself the balance of my time. in closing, i want to once again actually appreciate the comments that were made by the other side in the entirety of this debate because they really speak to, in essence, what they are trying to do. [[page h1909]] and i start again with this effectively unfunded mandate that was put on the irs by the other side. they talk about funding. they gave them $1.7 billion of responsibility under the affordable care act, but never a penny to pay for it. as my parents used to say when i was a kid: you should have thought about that when you did it. where was the recognition that these responsibilities that you are putting on them, you have got to pay for them? we have seen costs rise exponentially in so many different factors, but that is the essence of what is being done here. so we are not going to pay for it, but let's create tension and anxiety at the one place where the taxpayers will uprise, because we will stop talking to them. that is the essence of what is being done here. mr. chairman, once again, we are not asking for anything radical in response. in fact, we have already responded quite appropriately by putting $290 million more into the very issue that is at stake here. all we are saying is: come up with a plan. show us how you are going to do it. show us how, when 48 million people call you and ask for help with their taxes at a time when they don't have 34 minutes to wait on a phone, to be one of the lucky 30 percent that even get their phone call answered. do what a number of other agencies already do, give us a plan on how you are going to improve that. it is that simple. our purpose isn't to punish diligent irs employees, but rather to compel management to finally put the taxpayers first and take the need to improve the customer service experience seriously. upon learning that this legislation was in development, the irs reported to the gao that they have established a team to consider its customer service recommendations. how about that? after 3 years, no response. the irs commissioner himself says service is abysmal. and they say it has been satisfactory up to this point in time. but as soon as this legislation is introduced, we have customer service recommendations and a team being established. i don't think that is a coincidence. passing the bill into law will ensure that the process continues in good faith. mr. chairman, congress has a duty to oversee the irs and ensure that it is meeting the needs of american taxpayers. when the irs fails to meet those needs, it is up to congress to act. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. all time for general debate has expired. pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. in lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on ways and means, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of rules committee print 114-49. that amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. the text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows: h.r. 4890 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. ban on irs bonuses until irs develops comprehensive customer service strategy. (a) in general.--the secretary of the treasury, and the secretary's delegate, may not pay a bonus, award, or similar cash payment to any employee of the internal revenue service until the secretary, or the secretary's delegate, develops and submits to congress a comprehensive customer service strategy that has been reviewed and approved by the treasury inspector general for tax administration. such strategy shall include-- (1) appropriate telephone and correspondence levels of service, which shall be based on service provided by the best in business and customer expectations; (2) a thorough assessment of which services the internal revenue service can shift to self-service options; and (3) proposals to improve customer service in the short term (the current and following fiscal year), medium term (approximately three to five fiscal years), and long term (approximately ten fiscal years). (b) progress reports.--the secretary of the treasury, or the secretary's delegate, shall submit reports to the congress on the status of its customer service strategy and actions taken to improve customer service. such reports shall be submitted on a semiannual basis until the comprehensive customer service strategy under subsection (a) is fully implemented. sec. 2. no additional funds authorized. no additional funds are authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available to carry out the requirements of this act. such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated or made available. the acting chair. no amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in house report 114- 503. each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall be not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. amendment no. 1 offered by mr. meehan the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 1 printed in house report 114-503. mr. meehan. mr. chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from texas (mr. brady), i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 2, line 23, strike ``or made available''. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 688, the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. meehan) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from pennsylvania. mr. meehan. mr. chairman, this amendment is a technical amendment to clarify section 2 of the bill. this section states that no additional funds are authorized or otherwise made available to carry out the requirement of this bill. the language in the amendment makes it abundantly clear that we are not authorizing a new appropriation here. the irs needs to create a customer service agency. if they want to claim that they don't have enough money in the budget to be serving the taxpayers with an appropriate topnotch customer service strategy, then we are saying: give us a plan to do so, and withhold the bonuses until you do so. it is very, very simple. this amendment makes a technical correction to make our intentions here crystal clear. the irs doesn't need additional funding to make customer service the top priority when, in fact, it has already been given $290 million to do just this. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. pascrell. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the amendment. the acting chair. the gentleman from new jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. pascrell. mr. chairman, once again, my friends on the other side of the aisle are cutting off their nose to spite their face: more mandates on the irs with fewer resources and somehow expecting them to improve services. as i have said, the irs is servicing 9 million more people with $1 billion less. this amendment would only exacerbate that problem. the words of the seven former irs commissioners ring out here. why don't we just cut congressional office budgets by 17 percent, as we did with the irs, and then mandate that we improve constituent services or increase our workloads? that doesn't make any sense either. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. meehan). the amendment was agreed to. amendment no. 2 offered by mr. sanford the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 2 printed in house report 114-503. mr. sanford. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 2, after line 17, insert the following: [[page h1910]] (c) consultation with taxpayer advocate.--in developing the comprehensive customer service strategy pursuant to this section, the secretary, or the secretary's delegate, shall consult with the national taxpayer advocate. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 688, the gentleman from south carolina (mr. sanford) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from south carolina. mr. sanford. mr. chairman, i have a small but, i think, perfecting amendment that i think, whether republican or democrat, we can agree on. because i think as republicans and democrats, we may have different perspectives on this equation, but we would agree that money is power and that the irs has an immense amount of power, given the amount of money that it is, in essence, steward to and controls as money is moved from individuals across this country to the federal government. i think that we would agree that money without a plan is chaos. that is why in the military they have a five-paragraph order. that is why if you think about the business rule, you have a business plan. if you think about sports, you have got a game plan. you need to go through a planning process to effectively use money. i think we would agree that the government's role is to serve. i think it disturbed a lot of us that the lincoln memorial was closed back during the government shutdown. some people saw that as a way of maximizing inconvenience for folks, as a way of highlighting some rule we agreed or disagreed on as opposed to, again, staying focused on this larger notion of service. so i applaud the overall work of this bill and what it is about. i think that there is a problem when wait times move up threefold over the last 5 years. i think that there is a problem with dropped calls and infinity holds and all the other things that people have seen come their way as a result of dysfunction at the irs. we might see different remedies as to how we get there, but i think we would agree on those things. and so i applaud what is being done with this notion of saying: let's hold on bonuses. let's actually come up with a plan as we deal with how this additional $20 million is dispensed and used within the irs. this amendment simply says that as you go in consultation with the treasury, as you go in consultation with the ig, let's also include the national taxpayer advocate there at the irs. because i think it is important. you may deal with technology experts, you may deal with phone call experts, you may deal with taxation specialists, but to keep the bull's-eye the ultimate customer out there--and that is the taxpayer. too often the taxpayer is indeed the forgotten man or forgotten women in this equation. the idea of consulting with the national taxpayers union as you formulate those plans, again, i think make this a simply perfecting amendment, as you listen to the different constituencies that will be dealt with in coming up with this plan. i think that perspective is key in holding the taxpayers' viewpoint to be vital in the creation of this plan. that is all the amendment does. i yield to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. meehan). {time} 1045 mr. meehan. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. chair, let me just take a moment to say that the national taxpayer advocate has a long history of not only working on behalf of taxpayers, but working with the irs to improve customer service. i think having the national taxpayer advocate involved in this process of creating comprehensive service strategy will actually improve the final outcome. i thank the gentleman for taking his time not only to look at the totality of this bill, but to find a way to improve its implementation with that support. i support the addition, and i urge others to vote ``yes'' on the amendment. mr. sanford. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. pascrell. mr. chairman, i rise in strong opposition to this amendment. the acting chair. the gentleman from new jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. pascrell. mr. chairman, so let's get this amendment straight. this bill would have the irs work with the national taxpayer advocate, in addition to the treasury inspector general for tax administration, as i read it correctly, in coming up with a customer service plan. sounds good. however, you forget to mention one thing, mr. chairman, because the national taxpayer advocate and the treasury inspector general tax administrator have publicly stated, for the record, that the severe budget cuts enacted by the other side, mr. chairman, in congress have forced the irs to reduce its workforce, reduce training, reduce technology, and that these steps have weakened the ability to enforce the nation's tax laws--is that what you are looking for?--and serve taxpayers effectively. they said it, i didn't. you can't make this stuff up. so, instead of forcing the irs to work with the national taxpayer advocate, why don't we, in congress, listen to them, and fund the irs so it can do its job? this is the height of misdirection. i am only going by the words you have in this amendment. and i will tell you, they have made a statement very loud and clear to all of us. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from south carolina (mr. sanford). the amendment was agreed to. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. the amendment was agreed to. the acting chair. under the rule, the committee rises. accordingly, the committee rose; and the speaker pro tempore (mr. womack) having assumed the chair, mr. kelly of mississippi, acting chair of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union, reported that that committee, having had under consideration the bill (h.r. 4890) to impose a ban on the payment of bonuses to employees of the internal revenue service until the secretary of the treasury develops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy, and, pursuant to house resolution 688, he reported the bill back to the house with an amendment adopted in the committee of the whole. the speaker pro tempore. under the rule, the previous question is ordered. is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the committee of the whole? if not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. the amendment was agreed to. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the passage of the bill. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. pascrell. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, this 15- minute vote on passage of h.r. 4890 will be followed by a 5-minute vote on passage of h.r. 3724. the vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 260, nays 158, not voting 15, as follows: [roll no. 162] yeas--260

Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy) for the purposes of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come. (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9:00 a.m. for legislative business. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider H.R. 4498, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act, sponsored by Representative Steve Chabot. This bill extends the role of angel investing in assisting start-up businesses to acquire the financing needed to grow, innovate, and create jobs. The House will also consider H.R. 4901, the Scholarship for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act, sponsored by Representative Jason Chaffetz. This bill is essential to improving education outcomes for low-income students in the District of Columbia. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider H.J. Res. 88, sponsored by Representative Phil Roe, which disapproves of the rules submitted by the Department of Labor relating to the definition of the term ``fiduciary.'' This ill-advised rule will result in thousands of individuals being dropped by their financial advisers and unable to receive sound financial advice. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information as to the schedule. As I am sure he knows, I will want to ask him some questions about things that are not yet scheduled and, of course, the next week we will take a recess. {time} 1130 As the gentleman knows, the budget was passed out of the Budget Committee last month. We understand, of course, obviously, the Appropriations Committee is proceeding to mark up bills notwithstanding the fact that the budget has not been passed. We are not sure exactly what the allocations for each subcommittee are going to be because, apparently, there has been no 302(b) allocation, which is the allocation to the 12 subcommittees. It is going to be hard for us to tell exactly how much money is left if, in fact, appropriations bills are brought to the floor without knowing fully the distribution of funds for both defense and domestic priorities. First, let me ask the gentleman: Does the gentleman expect the budget to be brought to the floor prior to the bringing of appropriations bills to the floor? I yield to my friend. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. We will continue to work through the budget process, and I will update the Members once there is more information. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for the depth of that information. We do have a serious problem. And I want to tell my friend, the majority leader, as someone who had served on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years, obviously, one of the important facts to know is how much will be allocated for each one of the 12 subcommittees so you can make judgments, as bills come to the floor or as they come to full committee, about whether the funding levels for those are appropriate or whether there ought to be other priorities that ought to be brought to the floor. I appreciate the gentleman's response. I know that the Speaker has indicated that doing a budget is absolutely the responsible thing to do, that that is the regular order to do, and I know the budget has passed out of the committee. So I am wondering: What is holding the budget up, Mr. Leader? Why aren't we considering it? I yield to my friend. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding and asking again. As for the schedule, we are not scheduled for next week. We continue to work through. We think the budget is very important. When we have it scheduled, I will notify. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman, I suppose, for that additional information. Of course, it goes without saying that it is not scheduled next week, and we still don't have the knowledge that I think is necessary for us to have before you bring the appropriations bills to the floor. In having said that, I understand the gentleman's answer. There are three items that I have brought up before, Mr. Leader, that we think are critical items to be brought sooner rather than later that we need to deal with. First, I want to reiterate what I said last week. I appreciate the majority leader's and I appreciate the Speaker's action and the chairman of the committee, Mr. Bishop, in working with Treasury and with our side of the aisle to try to get a bill that we can agree on-- that can enjoy bipartisan support--that will address the crisis that confronts the American citizens who live in Puerto Rico. I also want to thank the gentleman--we had a meeting in his office-- in that he and I shared the view that we ought to have a bill that is simple and straightforward so that we can forge a bipartisan agreement and get this bill done. The Speaker has set May 1 as the deadline. It would appear that we are not going to meet that deadline. And we did not meet the March 31 deadline. But I know we had a meeting yesterday with our staffs. It was a positive meeting, and I hope it will lead to a productive meeting as well. I would like to yield to my friend to see if the gentleman has any comments about where we stand on our moving forward on a bill to address the fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico. I yield to my friend. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Yes, the gentleman is correct in that we have been working together, especially with the Natural Resources Committee, on the proposal. [[Page H1913]] I appreciate the gentleman's commitment as well in making sure that we produce a bill that has solid financial footing and no financial bailout, which the work we are doing right now does not. As the gentleman knows, the discussions are ongoing, and part of the challenge of finishing it is the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department still had some concerns. I know there were some meetings this week, and I know there were Members on your side of the aisle who did not feel comfortable in moving forward until the Treasury Department had finished some of those negotiations. But we look forward to getting the bill finished and moving it forward on a bipartisan basis, a bill that has no bailout, but that meets the needs with what is going on in Puerto Rico. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. I would reiterate what he and I both stated last week, which is that, clearly, this is not a bailout. There is no money contemplated that is going to Puerto Rico, and there is no extension of U.S. credit backing from the United States to Puerto Rico. What it is, as the gentleman knows, is just setting up a process for a restructuring of debt that everyone knows cannot be paid, and there needs to be some sort of rational way that Puerto Rico can work itself to both repay that which it can repay while, at the same time, maintain the absolutely essential services of education, health care, and public safety for the American citizens who live in Puerto Rico. So I would hope that we would continue to work on that. Again, the majority leader's staff and my staff, Treasury, and Mr. Bishop's staff, the leader's staff and Mr. Ryan's staff all have been working towards that end, and I appreciate that. But I think we all feel a sense of urgency. Even if we could work it out over the weekend or before we end next week, if we could bring it to the floor next week, if we had an agreement, I think that would be a good thing for us to do. I don't know whether it is possible--I hope it is possible--but I look forward to working with the majority leader towards that end. There are two other items, as you know, that I have mentioned in the past. Zika. There was a very compelling editorial in The Washington Post today about Zika. The administration has asked for $1.9 billion to address that crisis, which, clearly, almost every week, the CDC says is a growing one, with more exposure, with more of the United States' mainland being implicated as being at risk. In addition to that, of course, Ebola continues to be a continuing health challenge both in Africa and in this country, but mainly in Africa. As you know, we appropriated money. Mr. Rogers and the Appropriations Committee and the gentleman said: Look, we can take some of that money and move it over to the Zika effort. The problem with that, Mr. Leader, as I think you have heard me say before, is that Ebola continues to be a crisis. Is there any expectation that we could bring a supplemental appropriations bill for this emergency that confronts the health of our people here, in Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean, and, frankly, in other parts of the world? Is there any chance of bringing a supplemental to the floor to address both of those? In addition, Flint continues to be on bottled water because they have not yet been provided with a water system that works for their people. So those three items, in addition to Puerto Rico, I think are compelling, timely issues for us to address. Will the gentleman give me any additional information as to when that might occur? I yield to my friend. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to take the opportunity to thank the gentleman for working with us on Zika. As he knows, I approached him early on to make sure we dealt with this in a bipartisan manner. As to any threat, we want to make sure it is not a partisan issue. As the gentleman knows, there was somewhere around $2 billion in unobligated Ebola money. One of the ideas, especially when the administration had requested money, was to have time to go through and ask the question, and many of those questions have not been answered yet. We wanted to make sure no funding problems would happen. We are proud of the administration for its being able to take our idea and move almost $600 million into Zika as we go forward. That will take us quite a ways into this fiscal year. We are continuing to look at and to ask questions. I have a whole list here of questions that have been asked from a standpoint of an updated spending plan from HHS, which still hasn't been planned, of where they go, of what activities will the funds carry out, of how much funding do the agencies anticipate needing in 2016. I mean, as the gentleman knows, never should we write a blank check, but never should we turn a blind eye to a problem. I am proud of the fact that we have not and that we have responsibly made sure that close to $600 million is used right now. We have asked the questions of what we need to go forward. I know the Appropriations Committee is continuing to work on that. We have the appropriations process going through, and that will probably be the ideal time to deal with it and anything going any further because we would have the questions answered and the ability to fund it. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments. Let me make a couple of observations. I hear there is some discussion about the appropriations process. As the gentleman well knows, the appropriations process hasn't done too well lately. Forgetting about who is to blame or who is not to blame, the appropriations process, essentially, has not worked, as the gentleman knows. Of course, last year, as we had done the year before, we passed an omnibus and didn't pass the appropriations bills. My view is we have an emergency. It is doubtful that appropriations bills are going to get done in time. My own supposition is we are going to have a CR in September. We have, really, 40 days left between now, I think, and the August break of legislative days. It is going to be problematic, at best, to get appropriations bills done by October 1, much less to respond to an emergency, which is why we believe that a supplemental, really, is called for. We have two emergencies that are ongoing and a third in Flint, Michigan, and we believe that we ought to respond to those long before the possibility, much less the probability, of the appropriations bills passing this House, the Senate, and being signed by the President. Does the gentleman have any thoughts on that? Because, if you are contemplating an appropriations process, Mr. Leader, with all due respect, past history would tell us, over the last few years--again, forgetting about who is to blame for it--the appropriations process does not get done in a timely fashion. I yield to my friend. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. As the gentleman knows, the Appropriations Committee has already marked up three bills. The gentleman having served on Appropriations, he also understands that that is where you get a lot of questions answered, that that is where you get a lot of the good information from both sides of the aisle. There is close to $600 million for Zika right now. I have the same concern that you have. That is why I am telling the administration and the agencies that it would be very helpful if they would answer the questions needed. Where would this money go? There are so many from the perspective of: Is Ebola no longer a public health risk? You have $2 billion, unobligated, sitting in there that we could use. If we want to solve the Zika problem, I think we should all work together. I am looking for the administration to answer some questions. I think that is the most responsible way to go about solving this problem. I haven't given up on the appropriations process. I think it is a perfect opportunity, and I would think, for Members on both sides of the aisle, maybe it would give them a little incentive, in knowing the challenges that are out there for the American public, that this is the process that was created. And we could all have input. [[Page H1914]] One thing that we know, since this majority has taken over, is that we have an open process in appropriations as well; so, anybody can offer an amendment. I think that would be the best place to deal with this. I do have a very personal compassion in talking about water. I know the situation that happened in Flint. I have lived with water problems in California for quite some time. For the last three Congresses, I have fought very hard to solve that for California. Unfortunately, the other Chamber has done nothing. I have kids in the Central Valley who do not have water, people who are on bottled water they bring in, people who have portable water, where they have to come in and bring the tanks. We have lived this for quite some time; so, you will find, on this side of the aisle, someone who is very compassionate about it and who wants to deal with that water issue at the same time as well. I think it would be appropriate. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments and for his concern, which I think is sincere, about California. Let me say to him that I would certainly be open on this side of the aisle, as, I am sure, my Members would be, to working with him to address those issues. It is not a question of Flint, per se, but it is a question of some 6,000 to 9,000 children who have been exposed immediately, and it is an emergency now as they are not able to drink the water; they are drinking bottled water. My point is not that we ought not to address problems in California or, very frankly, in Maryland or in Ohio or in Florida or wherever else they may occur in league with the States and municipalities. Obviously, this is a partnership, not just our responsibility. {time} 1145 I would again reiterate, Zika and Ebola are both emergencies that need to be dealt with now. I think the gentleman is absolutely correct that we ought to know how much is needed, how it is going to be spent, and what effect it will have. I will tell you that one of my members in the whip meeting this morning, Mr. Leader, said that her understanding from her local health department was that their efforts with respect to Ebola and other infectious diseases are being adversely affected by the fact that that $589 million, which didn't just come out of the air, was transferred, as you pointed out and as I pointed out, to the Zika response. It was money that was--not obligated--planned to be spent in communities and in other areas to effect a solution to the challenge that confronts us. So it is not just as if that $589 million didn't have a purpose when we originally appropriated it. The gentleman supported it and I support it, so we allocated that money. I know the Appropriations Committee supported it. And I presume, as the gentleman points out, they had hearings to know exactly the answers to the questions. But we will work with you on getting answers to those questions from the administration. We would urge that, within the next few weeks, we have a supplemental on the floor, having those questions answered and being confident that the money is going to be spent, but knowing full well that people's health is at risk in this country. We have an empathy and a concern about that and want to respond to it. So I would hope that we could move it before the appropriations process because I think, unfortunately, the experience is, under all the parties that have been in control of this House over the years, that sometimes it happens slower than this emergency requires. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1912-H1914] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy) for the purposes of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come. (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9:00 a.m. for legislative business. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider H.R. 4498, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act, sponsored by Representative Steve Chabot. This bill extends the role of angel investing in assisting start-up businesses to acquire the financing needed to grow, innovate, and create jobs. The House will also consider H.R. 4901, the Scholarship for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act, sponsored by Representative Jason Chaffetz. This bill is essential to improving education outcomes for low-income students in the District of Columbia. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider H.J. Res. 88, sponsored by Representative Phil Roe, which disapproves of the rules submitted by the Department of Labor relating to the definition of the term ``fiduciary.'' This ill-advised rule will result in thousands of individuals being dropped by their financial advisers and unable to receive sound financial advice. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information as to the schedule. As I am sure he knows, I will want to ask him some questions about things that are not yet scheduled and, of course, the next week we will take a recess. {time} 1130 As the gentleman knows, the budget was passed out of the Budget Committee last month. We understand, of course, obviously, the Appropriations Committee is proceeding to mark up bills notwithstanding the fact that the budget has not been passed. We are not sure exactly what the allocations for each subcommittee are going to be because, apparently, there has been no 302(b) allocation, which is the allocation to the 12 subcommittees. It is going to be hard for us to tell exactly how much money is left if, in fact, appropriations bills are brought to the floor without knowing fully the distribution of funds for both defense and domestic priorities. First, let me ask the gentleman: Does the gentleman expect the budget to be brought to the floor prior to the bringing of appropriations bills to the floor? I yield to my friend. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. We will continue to work through the budget process, and I will update the Members once there is more information. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for the depth of that information. We do have a serious problem. And I want to tell my friend, the majority leader, as someone who had served on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years, obviously, one of the important facts to know is how much will be allocated for each one of the 12 subcommittees so you can make judgments, as bills come to the floor or as they come to full committee, about whether the funding levels for those are appropriate or whether there ought to be other priorities that ought to be brought to the floor. I appreciate the gentleman's response. I know that the Speaker has indicated that doing a budget is absolutely the responsible thing to do, that that is the regular order to do, and I know the budget has passed out of the committee. So I am wondering: What is holding the budget up, Mr. Leader? Why aren't we considering it? I yield to my friend. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding and asking again. As for the schedule, we are not scheduled for next week. We continue to work through. We think the budget is very important. When we have it scheduled, I will notify. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman, I suppose, for that additional information. Of course, it goes without saying that it is not scheduled next week, and we still don't have the knowledge that I think is necessary for us to have before you bring the appropriations bills to the floor. In having said that, I understand the gentleman's answer. There are three items that I have brought up before, Mr. Leader, that we think are critical items to be brought sooner rather than later that we need to deal with. First, I want to reiterate what I said last week. I appreciate the majority leader's and I appreciate the Speaker's action and the chairman of the committee, Mr. Bishop, in working with Treasury and with our side of the aisle to try to get a bill that we can agree on-- that can enjoy bipartisan support--that will address the crisis that confronts the American citizens who live in Puerto Rico. I also want to thank the gentleman--we had a meeting in his office-- in that he and I shared the view that we ought to have a bill that is simple and straightforward so that we can forge a bipartisan agreement and get this bill done. The Speaker has set May 1 as the deadline. It would appear that we are not going to meet that deadline. And we did not meet the March 31 deadline. But I know we had a meeting yesterday with our staffs. It was a positive meeting, and I hope it will lead to a productive meeting as well. I would like to yield to my friend to see if the gentleman has any comments about where we stand on our moving forward on a bill to address the fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico. I yield to my friend. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Yes, the gentleman is correct in that we have been working together, especially with the Natural Resources Committee, on the proposal. [[Page H1913]] I appreciate the gentleman's commitment as well in making sure that we produce a bill that has solid financial footing and no financial bailout, which the work we are doing right now does not. As the gentleman knows, the discussions are ongoing, and part of the challenge of finishing it is the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department still had some concerns. I know there were some meetings this week, and I know there were Members on your side of the aisle who did not feel comfortable in moving forward until the Treasury Department had finished some of those negotiations. But we look forward to getting the bill finished and moving it forward on a bipartisan basis, a bill that has no bailout, but that meets the needs with what is going on in Puerto Rico. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. I would reiterate what he and I both stated last week, which is that, clearly, this is not a bailout. There is no money contemplated that is going to Puerto Rico, and there is no extension of U.S. credit backing from the United States to Puerto Rico. What it is, as the gentleman knows, is just setting up a process for a restructuring of debt that everyone knows cannot be paid, and there needs to be some sort of rational way that Puerto Rico can work itself to both repay that which it can repay while, at the same time, maintain the absolutely essential services of education, health care, and public safety for the American citizens who live in Puerto Rico. So I would hope that we would continue to work on that. Again, the majority leader's staff and my staff, Treasury, and Mr. Bishop's staff, the leader's staff and Mr. Ryan's staff all have been working towards that end, and I appreciate that. But I think we all feel a sense of urgency. Even if we could work it out over the weekend or before we end next week, if we could bring it to the floor next week, if we had an agreement, I think that would be a good thing for us to do. I don't know whether it is possible--I hope it is possible--but I look forward to working with the majority leader towards that end. There are two other items, as you know, that I have mentioned in the past. Zika. There was a very compelling editorial in The Washington Post today about Zika. The administration has asked for $1.9 billion to address that crisis, which, clearly, almost every week, the CDC says is a growing one, with more exposure, with more of the United States' mainland being implicated as being at risk. In addition to that, of course, Ebola continues to be a continuing health challenge both in Africa and in this country, but mainly in Africa. As you know, we appropriated money. Mr. Rogers and the Appropriations Committee and the gentleman said: Look, we can take some of that money and move it over to the Zika effort. The problem with that, Mr. Leader, as I think you have heard me say before, is that Ebola continues to be a crisis. Is there any expectation that we could bring a supplemental appropriations bill for this emergency that confronts the health of our people here, in Puerto Rico, in the Caribbean, and, frankly, in other parts of the world? Is there any chance of bringing a supplemental to the floor to address both of those? In addition, Flint continues to be on bottled water because they have not yet been provided with a water system that works for their people. So those three items, in addition to Puerto Rico, I think are compelling, timely issues for us to address. Will the gentleman give me any additional information as to when that might occur? I yield to my friend. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to take the opportunity to thank the gentleman for working with us on Zika. As he knows, I approached him early on to make sure we dealt with this in a bipartisan manner. As to any threat, we want to make sure it is not a partisan issue. As the gentleman knows, there was somewhere around $2 billion in unobligated Ebola money. One of the ideas, especially when the administration had requested money, was to have time to go through and ask the question, and many of those questions have not been answered yet. We wanted to make sure no funding problems would happen. We are proud of the administration for its being able to take our idea and move almost $600 million into Zika as we go forward. That will take us quite a ways into this fiscal year. We are continuing to look at and to ask questions. I have a whole list here of questions that have been asked from a standpoint of an updated spending plan from HHS, which still hasn't been planned, of where they go, of what activities will the funds carry out, of how much funding do the agencies anticipate needing in 2016. I mean, as the gentleman knows, never should we write a blank check, but never should we turn a blind eye to a problem. I am proud of the fact that we have not and that we have responsibly made sure that close to $600 million is used right now. We have asked the questions of what we need to go forward. I know the Appropriations Committee is continuing to work on that. We have the appropriations process going through, and that will probably be the ideal time to deal with it and anything going any further because we would have the questions answered and the ability to fund it. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments. Let me make a couple of observations. I hear there is some discussion about the appropriations process. As the gentleman well knows, the appropriations process hasn't done too well lately. Forgetting about who is to blame or who is not to blame, the appropriations process, essentially, has not worked, as the gentleman knows. Of course, last year, as we had done the year before, we passed an omnibus and didn't pass the appropriations bills. My view is we have an emergency. It is doubtful that appropriations bills are going to get done in time. My own supposition is we are going to have a CR in September. We have, really, 40 days left between now, I think, and the August break of legislative days. It is going to be problematic, at best, to get appropriations bills done by October 1, much less to respond to an emergency, which is why we believe that a supplemental, really, is called for. We have two emergencies that are ongoing and a third in Flint, Michigan, and we believe that we ought to respond to those long before the possibility, much less the probability, of the appropriations bills passing this House, the Senate, and being signed by the President. Does the gentleman have any thoughts on that? Because, if you are contemplating an appropriations process, Mr. Leader, with all due respect, past history would tell us, over the last few years--again, forgetting about who is to blame for it--the appropriations process does not get done in a timely fashion. I yield to my friend. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. As the gentleman knows, the Appropriations Committee has already marked up three bills. The gentleman having served on Appropriations, he also understands that that is where you get a lot of questions answered, that that is where you get a lot of the good information from both sides of the aisle. There is close to $600 million for Zika right now. I have the same concern that you have. That is why I am telling the administration and the agencies that it would be very helpful if they would answer the questions needed. Where would this money go? There are so many from the perspective of: Is Ebola no longer a public health risk? You have $2 billion, unobligated, sitting in there that we could use. If we want to solve the Zika problem, I think we should all work together. I am looking for the administration to answer some questions. I think that is the most responsible way to go about solving this problem. I haven't given up on the appropriations process. I think it is a perfect opportunity, and I would think, for Members on both sides of the aisle, maybe it would give them a little incentive, in knowing the challenges that are out there for the American public, that this is the process that was created. And we could all have input. [[Page H1914]] One thing that we know, since this majority has taken over, is that we have an open process in appropriations as well; so, anybody can offer an amendment. I think that would be the best place to deal with this. I do have a very personal compassion in talking about water. I know the situation that happened in Flint. I have lived with water problems in California for quite some time. For the last three Congresses, I have fought very hard to solve that for California. Unfortunately, the other Chamber has done nothing. I have kids in the Central Valley who do not have water, people who are on bottled water they bring in, people who have portable water, where they have to come in and bring the tanks. We have lived this for quite some time; so, you will find, on this side of the aisle, someone who is very compassionate about it and who wants to deal with that water issue at the same time as well. I think it would be appropriate. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments and for his concern, which I think is sincere, about California. Let me say to him that I would certainly be open on this side of the aisle, as, I am sure, my Members would be, to working with him to address those issues. It is not a question of Flint, per se, but it is a question of some 6,000 to 9,000 children who have been exposed immediately, and it is an emergency now as they are not able to drink the water; they are drinking bottled water. My point is not that we ought not to address problems in California or, very frankly, in Maryland or in Ohio or in Florida or wherever else they may occur in league with the States and municipalities. Obviously, this is a partnership, not just our responsibility. {time} 1145 I would again reiterate, Zika and Ebola are both emergencies that need to be dealt with now. I think the gentleman is absolutely correct that we ought to know how much is needed, how it is going to be spent, and what effect it will have. I will tell you that one of my members in the whip meeting this morning, Mr. Leader, said that her understanding from her local health department was that their efforts with respect to Ebola and other infectious diseases are being adversely affected by the fact that that $589 million, which didn't just come out of the air, was transferred, as you pointed out and as I pointed out, to the Zika response. It was money that was--not obligated--planned to be spent in communities and in other areas to effect a solution to the challenge that confronts us. So it is not just as if that $589 million didn't have a purpose when we originally appropriated it. The gentleman supported it and I support it, so we allocated that money. I know the Appropriations Committee supported it. And I presume, as the gentleman points out, they had hearings to know exactly the answers to the questions.

I will tell you that one of my members in the whip meeting this morning, Mr. Leader, said that her understanding from her local health department was that their efforts with respect to Ebola and other infectious diseases are being adversely affected by the fact that that $589 million, which didn't just come out of the air, was transferred, as you pointed out and as I pointed out, to the Zika response. It was money that was--not obligated--planned to be spent in communities and in other areas to effect a solution to the challenge that confronts us. So it is not just as if that $589 million didn't have a purpose when we originally appropriated it. The gentleman supported it and I support it, so we allocated that money. I know the Appropriations Committee supported it. And I presume, as the gentleman points out, they had hearings to know exactly the answers to the questions. But we will work with you on getting answers to those questions from the administration. We would urge that, within the next few weeks, we have a supplemental on the floor, having those questions answered and being confident that the money is going to be spent, but knowing full well that people's health is at risk in this country. We have an empathy and a concern about that and want to respond to it. So I would hope that we could move it before the appropriations process because I think, unfortunately, the experience is, under all the parties that have been in control of this House over the years, that sometimes it happens slower than this emergency requires. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_168.csv,17932,17932,18001,"[congressional record volume 162, number 62 (thursday, april 21, 2016)] [house] [pages h1912-h1914] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] legislative program (mr. hoyer asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) mr. hoyer. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from california (mr. mccarthy) for the purposes of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come. (mr. mccarthy asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. mccarthy. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, on monday, no votes are expected in the house. on tuesday, the house will meet at noon for morning-hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. on wednesday and thursday, the house will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour and noon for legislative business. on friday, the house will meet at 9:00 a.m. for legislative business. mr. speaker, the house will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow. mr. speaker, the house will also consider h.r. 4498, the helping angels lead our startups act, sponsored by representative steve chabot. this bill extends the role of angel investing in assisting start-up businesses to acquire the financing needed to grow, innovate, and create jobs. the house will also consider h.r. 4901, the scholarship for opportunity and results reauthorization act, sponsored by representative jason chaffetz. this bill is essential to improving education outcomes for low-income students in the district of columbia. mr. speaker, the house will consider h.j. res. 88, sponsored by representative phil roe, which disapproves of the rules submitted by the department of labor relating to the definition of the term ``fiduciary.'' this ill-advised rule will result in thousands of individuals being dropped by their financial advisers and unable to receive sound financial advice. mr. hoyer. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for that information as to the schedule. as i am sure he knows, i will want to ask him some questions about things that are not yet scheduled and, of course, the next week we will take a recess. {time} 1130 as the gentleman knows, the budget was passed out of the budget committee last month. we understand, of course, obviously, the appropriations committee is proceeding to mark up bills notwithstanding the fact that the budget has not been passed. we are not sure exactly what the allocations for each subcommittee are going to be because, apparently, there has been no 302(b) allocation, which is the allocation to the 12 subcommittees. it is going to be hard for us to tell exactly how much money is left if, in fact, appropriations bills are brought to the floor without knowing fully the distribution of funds for both defense and domestic priorities. first, let me ask the gentleman: does the gentleman expect the budget to be brought to the floor prior to the bringing of appropriations bills to the floor? i yield to my friend. mr. mccarthy. i thank the gentleman for yielding. we will continue to work through the budget process, and i will update the members once there is more information. mr. hoyer. i thank the gentleman for the depth of that information. we do have a serious problem. and i want to tell my friend, the majority leader, as someone who had served on the appropriations committee for 23 years, obviously, one of the important facts to know is how much will be allocated for each one of the 12 subcommittees so you can make judgments, as bills come to the floor or as they come to full committee, about whether the funding levels for those are appropriate or whether there ought to be other priorities that ought to be brought to the floor. i appreciate the gentleman's response. i know that the speaker has indicated that doing a budget is absolutely the responsible thing to do, that that is the regular order to do, and i know the budget has passed out of the committee. so i am wondering: what is holding the budget up, mr. leader? why aren't we considering it? i yield to my friend. mr. mccarthy. i thank the gentleman for yielding and asking again. as for the schedule, we are not scheduled for next week. we continue to work through. we think the budget is very important. when we have it scheduled, i will notify. mr. hoyer. i thank the gentleman, i suppose, for that additional information. of course, it goes without saying that it is not scheduled next week, and we still don't have the knowledge that i think is necessary for us to have before you bring the appropriations bills to the floor. in having said that, i understand the gentleman's answer. there are three items that i have brought up before, mr. leader, that we think are critical items to be brought sooner rather than later that we need to deal with. first, i want to reiterate what i said last week. i appreciate the majority leader's and i appreciate the speaker's action and the chairman of the committee, mr. bishop, in working with treasury and with our side of the aisle to try to get a bill that we can agree on-- that can enjoy bipartisan support--that will address the crisis that confronts the american citizens who live in puerto rico. i also want to thank the gentleman--we had a meeting in his office-- in that he and i shared the view that we ought to have a bill that is simple and straightforward so that we can forge a bipartisan agreement and get this bill done. the speaker has set may 1 as the deadline. it would appear that we are not going to meet that deadline. and we did not meet the march 31 deadline. but i know we had a meeting yesterday with our staffs. it was a positive meeting, and i hope it will lead to a productive meeting as well. i would like to yield to my friend to see if the gentleman has any comments about where we stand on our moving forward on a bill to address the fiscal crisis in puerto rico. i yield to my friend. mr. mccarthy. i thank the gentleman for yielding. yes, the gentleman is correct in that we have been working together, especially with the natural resources committee, on the proposal. [[page h1913]] i appreciate the gentleman's commitment as well in making sure that we produce a bill that has solid financial footing and no financial bailout, which the work we are doing right now does not. as the gentleman knows, the discussions are ongoing, and part of the challenge of finishing it is the treasury department. the treasury department still had some concerns. i know there were some meetings this week, and i know there were members on your side of the aisle who did not feel comfortable in moving forward until the treasury department had finished some of those negotiations. but we look forward to getting the bill finished and moving it forward on a bipartisan basis, a bill that has no bailout, but that meets the needs with what is going on in puerto rico. mr. hoyer. i thank the gentleman. i would reiterate what he and i both stated last week, which is that, clearly, this is not a bailout. there is no money contemplated that is going to puerto rico, and there is no extension of u.s. credit backing from the united states to puerto rico. what it is, as the gentleman knows, is just setting up a process for a restructuring of debt that everyone knows cannot be paid, and there needs to be some sort of rational way that puerto rico can work itself to both repay that which it can repay while, at the same time, maintain the absolutely essential services of education, health care, and public safety for the american citizens who live in puerto rico. so i would hope that we would continue to work on that. again, the majority leader's staff and my staff, treasury, and mr. bishop's staff, the leader's staff and mr. ryan's staff all have been working towards that end, and i appreciate that. but i think we all feel a sense of urgency. even if we could work it out over the weekend or before we end next week, if we could bring it to the floor next week, if we had an agreement, i think that would be a good thing for us to do. i don't know whether it is possible--i hope it is possible--but i look forward to working with the majority leader towards that end. there are two other items, as you know, that i have mentioned in the past. zika. there was a very compelling editorial in the washington post today about zika. the administration has asked for $1.9 billion to address that crisis, which, clearly, almost every week, the cdc says is a growing one, with more exposure, with more of the united states' mainland being implicated as being at risk. in addition to that, of course, ebola continues to be a continuing health challenge both in africa and in this country, but mainly in africa. as you know, we appropriated money. mr. rogers and the appropriations committee and the gentleman said: look, we can take some of that money and move it over to the zika effort. the problem with that, mr. leader, as i think you have heard me say before, is that ebola continues to be a crisis. is there any expectation that we could bring a supplemental appropriations bill for this emergency that confronts the health of our people here, in puerto rico, in the caribbean, and, frankly, in other parts of the world? is there any chance of bringing a supplemental to the floor to address both of those? in addition, flint continues to be on bottled water because they have not yet been provided with a water system that works for their people. so those three items, in addition to puerto rico, i think are compelling, timely issues for us to address. will the gentleman give me any additional information as to when that might occur? i yield to my friend. mr. mccarthy. i thank the gentleman for yielding. i want to take the opportunity to thank the gentleman for working with us on zika. as he knows, i approached him early on to make sure we dealt with this in a bipartisan manner. as to any threat, we want to make sure it is not a partisan issue. as the gentleman knows, there was somewhere around $2 billion in unobligated ebola money. one of the ideas, especially when the administration had requested money, was to have time to go through and ask the question, and many of those questions have not been answered yet. we wanted to make sure no funding problems would happen. we are proud of the administration for its being able to take our idea and move almost $600 million into zika as we go forward. that will take us quite a ways into this fiscal year. we are continuing to look at and to ask questions. i have a whole list here of questions that have been asked from a standpoint of an updated spending plan from hhs, which still hasn't been planned, of where they go, of what activities will the funds carry out, of how much funding do the agencies anticipate needing in 2016. i mean, as the gentleman knows, never should we write a blank check, but never should we turn a blind eye to a problem. i am proud of the fact that we have not and that we have responsibly made sure that close to $600 million is used right now. we have asked the questions of what we need to go forward. i know the appropriations committee is continuing to work on that. we have the appropriations process going through, and that will probably be the ideal time to deal with it and anything going any further because we would have the questions answered and the ability to fund it. mr. hoyer. i thank the gentleman for his comments. let me make a couple of observations. i hear there is some discussion about the appropriations process. as the gentleman well knows, the appropriations process hasn't done too well lately. forgetting about who is to blame or who is not to blame, the appropriations process, essentially, has not worked, as the gentleman knows. of course, last year, as we had done the year before, we passed an omnibus and didn't pass the appropriations bills. my view is we have an emergency. it is doubtful that appropriations bills are going to get done in time. my own supposition is we are going to have a cr in september. we have, really, 40 days left between now, i think, and the august break of legislative days. it is going to be problematic, at best, to get appropriations bills done by october 1, much less to respond to an emergency, which is why we believe that a supplemental, really, is called for. we have two emergencies that are ongoing and a third in flint, michigan, and we believe that we ought to respond to those long before the possibility, much less the probability, of the appropriations bills passing this house, the senate, and being signed by the president. does the gentleman have any thoughts on that? because, if you are contemplating an appropriations process, mr. leader, with all due respect, past history would tell us, over the last few years--again, forgetting about who is to blame for it--the appropriations process does not get done in a timely fashion. i yield to my friend. mr. mccarthy. i thank the gentleman for yielding. as the gentleman knows, the appropriations committee has already marked up three bills. the gentleman having served on appropriations, he also understands that that is where you get a lot of questions answered, that that is where you get a lot of the good information from both sides of the aisle. there is close to $600 million for zika right now. i have the same concern that you have. that is why i am telling the administration and the agencies that it would be very helpful if they would answer the questions needed. where would this money go? there are so many from the perspective of: is ebola no longer a public health risk? you have $2 billion, unobligated, sitting in there that we could use. if we want to solve the zika problem, i think we should all work together. i am looking for the administration to answer some questions. i think that is the most responsible way to go about solving this problem. i haven't given up on the appropriations process. i think it is a perfect opportunity, and i would think, for members on both sides of the aisle, maybe it would give them a little incentive, in knowing the challenges that are out there for the american public, that this is the process that was created. and we could all have input. [[page h1914]] one thing that we know, since this majority has taken over, is that we have an open process in appropriations as well; so, anybody can offer an amendment. i think that would be the best place to deal with this. i do have a very personal compassion in talking about water. i know the situation that happened in flint. i have lived with water problems in california for quite some time. for the last three congresses, i have fought very hard to solve that for california. unfortunately, the other chamber has done nothing. i have kids in the central valley who do not have water, people who are on bottled water they bring in, people who have portable water, where they have to come in and bring the tanks. we have lived this for quite some time; so, you will find, on this side of the aisle, someone who is very compassionate about it and who wants to deal with that water issue at the same time as well. i think it would be appropriate. mr. hoyer. i thank the gentleman for his comments and for his concern, which i think is sincere, about california. let me say to him that i would certainly be open on this side of the aisle, as, i am sure, my members would be, to working with him to address those issues. it is not a question of flint, per se, but it is a question of some 6,000 to 9,000 children who have been exposed immediately, and it is an emergency now as they are not able to drink the water; they are drinking bottled water. my point is not that we ought not to address problems in california or, very frankly, in maryland or in ohio or in florida or wherever else they may occur in league with the states and municipalities. obviously, this is a partnership, not just our responsibility. {time} 1145 i would again reiterate, zika and ebola are both emergencies that need to be dealt with now. i think the gentleman is absolutely correct that we ought to know how much is needed, how it is going to be spent, and what effect it will have. i will tell you that one of my members in the whip meeting this morning, mr. leader, said that her understanding from her local health department was that their efforts with respect to ebola and other infectious diseases are being adversely affected by the fact that that $589 million, which didn't just come out of the air, was transferred, as you pointed out and as i pointed out, to the zika response. it was money that was--not obligated--planned to be spent in communities and in other areas to effect a solution to the challenge that confronts us. so it is not just as if that $589 million didn't have a purpose when we originally appropriated it. the gentleman supported it and i support it, so we allocated that money. i know the appropriations committee supported it. and i presume, as the gentleman points out, they had hearings to know exactly the answers to the questions. but we will work with you on getting answers to those questions from the administration. we would urge that, within the next few weeks, we have a supplemental on the floor, having those questions answered and being confident that the money is going to be spent, but knowing full well that people's health is at risk in this country. we have an empathy and a concern about that and want to respond to it. so i would hope that we could move it before the appropriations process because i think, unfortunately, the experience is, under all the parties that have been in control of this house over the years, that sometimes it happens slower than this emergency requires. i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",17932

Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the rising cost of our Nation's nuclear forces budget. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that between 2015 and 2024, the administration's plans for nuclear forces will cost us about $348 billion. That is about $35 billion a year on our nuclear enterprise. According to the CBO, this is about 5 to 6 percent of the total cost of the administration's plans for our national defense for the next 10 years. Next week, the House Armed Services Committee will mark up the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, our military bill, if you will. One of my main priorities in the committee has been to reduce our Nation's nuclear weapons spending and to reduce our nuclear stockpile. Unfortunately, year after year, the Congress authorizes funding for more weapons while capping the funding that we use to dismantle nuclear weapons. I think it is a far safer world without these nuclear weapons. Mr. Speaker, rather than spend on the legacy of the cold war, we should be investing in our most important military asset: our men and our women in uniform. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [House] [Page H1914] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NUCLEAR FORCES BUDGET (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

Evelyn Beatrice Hall, the late British author, wrote: ``I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.'' In Bangladesh, discrimination and deadly violence against atheists, secularists, Hindus, Buddhists, and other religious minorities have unfortunately become a regular occurrence. This underscores the absolute necessity of not only defeating this global wave of intolerance, but standing up and fighting for the right of others to freely express their views regardless of whether you agree with those views or not.

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgH1915-5,CREC-2016-04-21,114,REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1915-H1916] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, in October of this year, the Republic of Georgia will hold elections. More than just an election to determine its national leadership, this election will likely determine whether the Republic of Georgia remains a semi-free country that will continue on a path to self-determination or whether it will succumb to corruption, Russian oligarch influence, and Russian domination. Georgia has a long history of fighting to protect its identity against evil tyrants, bullying neighbors, corrupted officials, and outright invasion. A small but important nation with its distinct language and people, Georgian territory forms a vital land bridge between Eastern Europe and West Asia that is nestled on the Black Sea. With the exception of her neighbor Armenia, much of her history has been fighting for survival against her neighbors wanting to force her into Russian, Turkish, or Persian domination. Since Georgia's reassertion of independence from her Russian masters in 1991, her struggle has not been easy. Balanced between a crumbling Soviet Union and internal unrest, Georgia emerged from several years of civil strife to defend her independence. Georgia saw her first President, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, ousted by Russian-backed leaders, such as Eduard Shevardnadze. During attempts to restore elected government, President Gamsakhurdia later would lose his life in still mysterious circumstances. After a period of domination by Russian-backed forces and political leaders, the nascent Republic of Georgia strove for great reforms in the Rose Revolution of 2003, finally breaking her chains and setting a path toward self-determination. The United States and the international community embraced [[Page H1916]] this effort, and global monitors affirmed the legitimate vote of the people that exposed the corruption of the election results. {time} 1200 Shevardnadze's government attempted to ignore the true results, but the Georgian people had a different plan and peacefully forced Shevardnadze to succumb to the will of the people as they stormed the parliament with roses. It was one of the most inspirational episodes of freedom in world history. Since then, Georgia has enjoyed a period of self-determination, Western engagement, human rights improvements, and trade. This has not been without cost. Separatists in the Georgian districts of Ossetia and Abkhazia, encouraged by Moscow, cast the Republic of Georgia into turmoil. Russia used this unrest as pretext to invade Georgia and still occupies these territories while denouncing earlier agreements to close Russian bases on Georgia's Black Sea coast. Still, President Mikheil Saakashvili was able to take his rightful place as the duly elected President of Georgia, and his reforms brought Georgia from a backward status in the world to a much improved financial structure, with marked increases in economic growth and foreign investment. For all of Georgia's struggles, for all of her self-determination, outside neighbors once again are vying to make Georgia subservient to their wishes. Russia has been stung by free peoples in independent states that she once dominated in the Soviet era that now choose instead to preserve their language, culture, history, and restore their freedom. Russia, for its part, has done everything in its power to force these peoples back into a serf status. Whether in Crimea, Ukraine, the Baltic States, or Georgia, the pattern has been the same. Russia's playbook starts with flooding opposition groups with cash from oligarchs loyal to Moscow. Separatists are courted in areas with some Russian ethnicity and then encouraged to foment division against these struggling republics, demanding their rights for Russian peoples in these territories. Russia then aids militias to create violence that strains the local political and law enforcement structure, causing the people living there to wish for anything--even the bad old days--to somehow restore order. Then national political parties are infiltrated and flushed with oligarch cash and promises of power as they convert legitimate parliaments into calls for pro-Moscow governance that, in essence, become nothing more than the old Soviet Socialist structure ruled by Moscow. In Georgia, it has been no different. Despite Georgia casting off outside invaders and attempting to push off the chains of Russia in the early 1800s or in 1918 or in 1991, Russia somehow feels it is her right to treat Georgians as a subclass of human beings that only exist to serve the interests of Moscow and her territory should only merely be a transitway for Russian interests. After the successful removal of Russian chains in the Rose Revolution in 2003, Russia has continually bullied Georgia's political system, fomented unrest in Abkhazia and Ossetia, invaded Georgia, and violated her agreement to withdraw from bases in Georgian territory. Amazingly, through all of this, Georgia has remained resolute. So, in classic form, Russia has moved to infiltrate the political process in the hopes of creating its own pro-Moscow government in the Georgian capital to hand them everything on a silver political platter. Chief among the funding efforts and political infiltration is oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, a close ally of Vladimir Putin. The aim is to rig votes along the same lines as was attempted in 2003 by buying votes, punishing political opponents, using Georgia's own administrative and political resources to influence the elections while using Georgian special forces to influence the outcomes. Combined with the full privatization of the election commissions, who one source estimates is now 98 percent controlled by Ivanishvili, the Georgian people face an alarming prospect in their right to free elections in October of this year. Faced with such bullying, the Georgian people are looking to the world for support. It is somehow fitting, Mr. Speaker, that this Saturday marks St. George's Day in world history. St. George, the Christian martyr and mythical slayer of dragons, is the namesake from whom the country of Georgia takes its name, according to some legends. The Georgian people are willing to slay this political dragon and stand for their freedom as they have before, but they need our help. We can ignore their pleas--after all, most Americans don't even know where Georgia is on the map--or we can give them a megaphone to shout their message, and the message is this: They wish to remain free. Here are some simple steps that we, in our country, can take: We call on the President of the United States to assist in monitoring of this fall's election processes in Georgia, as we once assisted them in the pivotal 2003 elections. We call upon the Georgian electoral commissions to be restored to representative membership to counter the private buyout being conducted by Moscow and their proxy, oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili. We call upon the United States Department of Treasury and Western banks to freeze the assets of Ivanishvili for violations as an illegal arms trader. We call upon the State Department to flag Georgian officials and business leaders who are discovered to be complicit in tampering with free elections to have their visas revoked and their assets frozen. We also call upon Western journalists in our free press to give the Georgian people a chance to have their story heard by investigating and covering the remaining few months of what could be the last free months of a Republic of Georgia. Finally, we call upon the self-determined, free, and resolute people of Georgia to stand in the spirit of St. George. Hold your head high, grasp the lance, and pierce the attacking dragon. You have been threatened before. By your commitment, as in 2003, you can show the world again that freedom will not succumb to corruption and intimidation. The people of Georgia should also know the God of the universe does not slumber. We, the people of the United States, join with the people of Georgia in our prayers for your freedom.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I so much appreciate my colleague and friend talking about the Georgia election. We should be encouraging fair elections everywhere and, when they are not fair, calling those to account. Not that we are the policemen of the world, but it becomes so much more unfortunate when you have a nation like Egypt that gets pushed into elections before they are ready, the Muslim Brotherhood takes over the country, as in Egypt when Morsi became President. He began shredding the Constitution and taking more and more power as it happened in Venezuela with Chavez and other countries. He had taken a lesson: This is the way you do it. You get elected, and then you start seizing more and more power. To the credit of the Egyptian people, their story in recent years is the greatest peaceful uprising in the history of the world. It wasn't entirely peaceful because of the violence of the Muslim Brotherhood. They want a world caliphate, and they want to start with something resembling the old Ottoman Empire, that caliphate that came around North Africa and on around the Mediterranean, and they need Egypt in order to make the beginning of the caliphate work. And so they were quite happy when radical Islam, Muslim Brotherhood, took over Egypt through Morsi. But when the Egyptian people, a third of the population, basically--30 million or so of the 90 million there in the nation of Egypt--rose up together, yes, you had Muslims marching with Christians. [[Page H1917]] The Coptic Christian Pope himself has told me more than once how moving it was to have Muslims and Christians and Jews and secularists walking together through the streets in Egypt demanding an end to radical Islamic control, demanding that the President, who was constantly violating the Constitution, be removed. The Coptic Pope told me that it was moving when Muslims, who just wanted peace in Egypt--they didn't want radical Islamic control--would come up to him and apologize for the way that Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood and radical Islamists were acting. And, yes, among Muslims, they are able to recognize that there is a part of Islam--the radical Islamists--that they don't like, but it is a part of Islam. When the administration in this country tells the world that there is no such thing as radical Islam, then they are demeaning and degrading those courageous Muslims who stand up and say: We need to stop radical Islam within Muslims, within the Islamic movement. They actually do damage to the people who want to live in peace. So we are grateful to the people of Egypt for stopping the caliphate before it could be really set in concrete around North Africa and, of course, Syria, all the way around. They want to get back to the old Ottoman Empire and spread and cover the world under the caliphate. It is really most interesting. We have a President who went to elementary school in Muslim school and was trained in Islam in elementary school, and that is the main part of his training on Islam. Because, as we know, he sat under Jeremiah Wright's teaching in church for 20 years or so. So the basic teaching on Islam was in elementary school, whereas there is the ultimate world expert on what is or is not Islam that most of the world recognizes. They don't down the street here, down Pennsylvania Avenue. They don't at the State Department under Secretary Kerry. But most of the world recognizes that a man who got degrees, including his doctor of philosophy, his Ph.D., in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad, is an expert on Islam. He says radical Islam is Islam. He didn't just get a little elementary school training on Islam. He studied Islam his whole life, has a Ph.D. in Islamic studies, and has continued to pour himself into study of the Koran, and he happens to be the head of the Islamic State. {time} 1215 It would seem that if somebody who spent his life studying--rather than just studying Islam in elementary school--says the Islamic State is truly Islam, perhaps the so-called experts in our State Department and our White House ought to listen to that and take notice as well that perhaps maybe it is not as they have been saying, that it is not Islam. It is Islam, but it is a part of Islam, the radical Islamists, and we should be standing against it. So, again, the Iran treaty clearly is a treaty. It needs to be called for what it is: a treaty. And we need to have people in the Senate with courage to step up and say we need a vote on the Iran treaty, because it is a treaty. The Corker bill doesn't apply because it is a treaty. Take the vote. Two-thirds will not vote for it. It will not be confirmed. Then we can call the Iran treaty at an end, because it never was properly agreed to. But in the meantime, since this administration put so much of what credibility it has on the table and at risk by backing the Iran deal, Iran--it may be the run-in leaders, their radical Islamic leaders, want to take over the world. They may be crazy in that regard, they may be power crazy in that regard, but they are very intelligent. You can be crazy and still be highly intelligent. That is how you can be crazy enough to fly a plane into a building and kill thousands of innocent people, but you are intelligent enough to have your engineers look at the plans and figure out what kind of load it would take to bring down a building like the World Trade Center. An article by Joel Pollak from last year--this is last year--and he says: ``In his State of the Union address'' last year, ``President Barack Obama claimed: `Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies, including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.' '' Mr. Pollak's article says: ``None of that is true. The chances of an agreement have dropped sharply, and even the most optimistic analysts do not expect a deal that `prevents a nuclear-armed Iran,' but only one that puts nuclear `breakout' out of reach for a while. Most important of all, we have not `halted the progress' of Iran's nuclear program. Earlier this month, the Tehran regime announced that it was building two new reactors, and is thought to be behind a suspected facility planned in Syria as well. ``In a lengthy essay in Commentary magazine, the invaluable Omri Ceren summarizes the history of President Obama's appeasement of the Iranian's, from the first failed `suckers deal,' as the French called it, through the new veto threats against congressional sanctions. ``The scale of the Obama administration's incompetence is simply daunting. Far from rallying international unity against Iran, President Obama has destroyed it by giving away global demands decades in the making. ``Suddenly, the reason for . . . invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Congress--without consultation from the White House--becomes clear . . . it is not the pro-Israel nature of Congress that drove the Bibi''--Netanyahu--``invitation. It is the fact that Obama''-- Well, it says he misrepresented things, but that is this article. But it goes on to point out that ``there at least five ways in which Iran has explicitly violated the interim agreement'' and spells those out. This is over a year old. They have never stopped violating the agreement--not the interim agreement--they were violating it, the executive agreement that this President entered with Iran. They so much sank their reputation into the Iran treaty that has not been ratified that these constant violations by Iran have the administration defending Iran, sending them money, covering for Iran, making excuses for Iran. This article was from less than a year ago by Cory Bennett from The Hill: ``A diplomatic deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program could inadvertently jumpstart the country's cyber warfare efforts. ``Experts say Tehran might use the economic sanctions relief from the nuclear pact to buttress its growing cyber program, which has already infiltrated critical networks in over a dozen countries, including the U.S.'' So the article goes on to point out: ``We are in a lose-lose situation.'' It is clear to most of us that the Iranian agreement was a huge mistake. They are the largest state supporters of terrorism in the world, and this administration is ongoing right now in giving billions and billions of dollars. And though the Iranian leaders have lied about so many things, when they say that the money that President Obama gives to them, which they don't currently have--the $100 billion to $150 billion in the first year, perhaps $100 billion or so each year after that; it remains to be seen--their Iranian leaders say: We are going to be able to fund more terrorist organizations. That is a statement we should take seriously. That is something that we should believe when they tell us these things. So the President is giving them the money. This article says this week that, of the $3 billion that was recently provided to Iran, this administration can't really tell if they have used it to support additional terrorism or not. But this article that was written in May of last year that the Iran deal could help fund Iran's cyber war, I bring that up now--it is from May 10 of last year from Mr. Bennett--because it was just in the last 4 or 5 months that John Hayward wrote the article: ``Iran Hacks State Department Social Media Accounts.'' We know they have hacked a New York dam Web site. They have explored defenses of the United States Government's Internet. [[Page H1918]] Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to look back and see that, wow, in May of last year, there were reporters that were warning that this deal with Iran may help them in their cyber warfare against us greater than we even know. Then we find out that this administration put a hold on charges against the Iranians that hacked into our government system until after the deal was made so that people didn't raise more of a fuss to try to stop the Iranian treaty. Well, it is still not too late. The Senate could go ahead and take a vote. We know that Harry Reid had said: Gee, there are some low-level confirmations that are so important to the country, we are going to set aside the cloture rule. It only takes 51 votes to do that. Mr. Speaker, I would submit that this Iranian treaty--I keep saying it because it is so critical to the world and to any chance at a semblance of world peace--has to be stopped because it is enriching the largest supporter of terrorism in the world. The Iranian leaders have made clear to the Iranian people that they have no intention of being bound by any agreement with President Obama, John Kerry, or the people here in the U.S. They are still going to do what they want to. So all the Senate has to do is take a vote--51 votes; there are plenty of Republicans to do that--and they might just get some Democrats that are too afraid to be seen as supportive of Iran and this nuclear deal that they may get some Democrat votes. Vote with 51 votes to set aside the cloture rule so you can bring treaty to the floor, have a vote on confirmation--it won't get the two-thirds--and then you would have all kinds of people that should have standing to go into Federal court and put a stop to the billions of dollars that this administration is releasing illegally to Iran. That is, funding--this administration says they know not what--it could be terrorism, they are not sure. I would submit they would--Iran would be supporting terrorism. But here are five things that the article pointed out that they were--even a year ago--breaking the interim agreement: ``Trying to buy equipment for plutonium reactor at Arak, breaking commitment to suspend work. The Obama administration actually complained about the purchases to the U.N. Security Council, even as it told the world that Iran had `lived up to its end of the bargain.' '' They are ``feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into a plant where it had agreed to suspend nuclear enrichment. The Institute for Science and International Security noted that Iran had begun enrichment at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz. It notified the Obama administration, which complained to the Iranians, which then claimed to have stop the enrichment activity.'' Three: ``Withholding camera footage of nuclear facilities, defying the International Atomic Energy Agency. A leading International Atomic Energy Agency official recently said the agency was `not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran' . . . The interim deal was to provide surveillance footage of Iranian nuclear facilities, but Iran has only provided would what it wants to reveal.'' And that is consistent with what Steve King and I and a couple of other Members were told by the IAEA inspectors who were in charge of inspecting Iran, that they can only go by what they are given. They are not given access to military facilities. They are not being given this footage. I am very proud to yield to my dear friend from Kentucky (Mr. Massie), a proud graduate of MIT on the floor. Mr. MASSIE. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding to me. This is a very interesting topic that you are speaking on, and I have never had the chance on the floor to explain my feelings on this vote nor the reason why I voted as I did on the Iran bill. So I appreciate the opportunity to say a little bit about this. Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that the gentleman from Texas is basically qualifying the Iran deal as a treaty, and I agree with that position. In fact, I believe I was the only Congressman to vote ``present'' on that bill. And the reason that I did vote ``present''--I just wanted a chance to clarify this--is that I felt that it was a treaty. I know a lot of us felt that way and we had different ways of dealing with that vote, but I voted ``present'' to indicate it was a treaty and that it really shouldn't have even been here in the House of Representatives. {time} 1230 According to the Constitution, only the Senate shall agree to the treaties, and not the House. We shouldn't really have a say in that. So I just wanted the opportunity, and I appreciate the gentleman from Texas giving me this opportunity, to explain the reason that I voted ``present.'' I think it was only the second time since I have been in Congress, and it was for a constitutional reason. I felt strongly that was a treaty. I thank the gentleman from Texas for this opportunity. Mr. GOHMERT. If the gentleman would hang on for a moment, I voted for the bill, but I did not feel like it adequately dealt with the issue that my friend from Kentucky raised, but I completely respect that position. Since the gentleman from Kentucky and I have had a lot of discussions about Iran and the Iranian treaty and his feelings, I have always felt that his vote, ``present,'' made eminent sense, was consistent with our position. Really, the vote on what we took didn't really matter so much as the point that the gentleman has just made. This is a treaty. The Senate needs to vote on it. Our vote, though nice, was not particularly relevant to the fact that it is a treaty. I would like to ask, if the gentleman would yield for a question, because I saw that there was a handsome young man in a blue shirt that came in with him, and wondered if he might identify who has accompanied him onto the floor. Mr. MASSIE. As the gentleman from Texas knows, we are allowed to bring younger constituents and visitors, and we have a visitor from Kentucky; that is true. His name is Joe. Mr. GOHMERT. I thought perhaps he might be from Kentucky. Mr. MASSIE. His name is Joe. Mr. GOHMERT. That is wonderful. He looks quite comfortable here on the floor, looks like he would be a good fit some day. I thank my friend for making that point. The vote that we took last year pointed out that the Iranians had not complied; the administration had not complied, as I recall, with the requirements to provide proper information. But the gentleman from Kentucky is exactly right. The real issue was a vote in the Senate on it being a treaty. The Senate has not yet voted on the Iranian treaty as a treaty, and if they would do that, when it didn't get the two-thirds votes, then we could stop the outrage of sending billions of dollars to a country that has a massive amount of American, precious American blood on its hands because of the way in which they have funded terrorism. They were the largest provider of IEDs when Americans were fighting for Muslim freedom in Iraq, and yet Iran continued to build and furnish IEDs. It needs to be dealt with. People are suffering in the world. Mr. Speaker, I mentioned Egypt, and what a great day for world history when a third of the population rose up, 30 million people that had never risen up in the history of the world, in peaceful demonstration, despite the Muslim Brotherhood's violence to try to make it appear otherwise. They had never risen up like those people did in Egypt. They are to be commended. I would humbly submit that if this administration would help Egypt and be the friend to Egypt that it is being in helping Iran and providing money to Iran, then the world would be a far better place than it is with all the help that this administration is providing to Iran. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the ultimate result of the Clinton, Wendy Sherman deal with North Korea, in which, in essence, the Clinton administration says: Hey, we will give you nuclear--we will let you have nuclear power. We will give you what you need to have if you will just sign and say you won't ever use it to develop nukes. And then, big shocker for some in the Democratic administration--it wasn't [[Page H1919]] to most of us that were watching from afar in different places in the United States--North Korea lied. They did use what we provided to create nuclear weapons, and now the world is a much less safe place. So I have no doubt that someday, maybe, some Iranian will kill me; but somebody will be here on the floor, if the Capitol still exists, and will point out that this deal that Obama and Kerry and Wendy Sherman did with Iran, in allowing them to move forward with nuclear activity, providing them with $100 billion or so to start off, hundreds of billions in the future, that they ended up lying when they said they agreed, initially, to the agreement--even though they have said publicly: We are not going to abide by it--that they ended up using results from the Obama administration's treaty to develop nuclear weapons, and that, just like the Clinton-Albright-Sherman deal with North Korea, the Obama-Kerry-Sherman deal with Iran has resulted in Iran having nukes sooner than they would have otherwise, despite the promises previously by the Obama administration to prevent Iran from having nukes. Actually, they helped them get the nukes. North Carolina's Passage of House Bill 2 Mr. GOHMERT. I want to turn to one other subject that has been very controversial--North Carolina has gotten a bad rap--and this article from ABC News, ``North Carolina's Controversial `Anti-LGBT' Bill Explained.'' The article says: ``Several civil rights groups and LGBTQ advocates are organizing a rally tonight in Raleigh''--this is from March 24 of this year--``North Carolina, to protest the State's controversial passage of its House Bill 2, which critics have called `the most anti- LGBT bill in the country.' '' The article says: ``Here's everything you need to know about the bill, also known as The Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, which was signed into law by Governor Pat McCrory on Wednesday. ``What does it do? ``House Bill 2 declares that State law overrides all local ordinances concerning wages, employment, and public accommodations.'' ``Thus, the law now bars local municipalities from creating their own rules prohibiting discrimination in public places based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Though North Carolina does have a statewide nondiscrimination law, it does not include specific protections for LGBTQ people.'' We keep adding letters, you know. We kept adding letters until we got to LGBT, and now we have added Q. ``The law also directs all public schools, government agencies, and public college campuses to require that multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities, such as locker rooms, be designated for use only by people based on their `biological sex' stated on their birth certificate. Transgender people can use the bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their gender identity only if they get the biological sex on their birth certificate changed.'' ``Under the law, public institutions can still offer single-occupancy facilities.'' And nobody has a problem with that. If you have got a single bathroom facility that has just got one facility for going to the bathroom, that is fine. It can be for whoever needs to use it. But they are saying, as has been consistent with the history of the world for most of the world's existence, that if you, according to documentation, are a female, you use the female restroom when it is for multiple people's use at the same time; and if, by documentation, you are a male, you use the male facilities. It has really been shocking to see how many people, including singers and entertainers and different groups--I understand Target now wants to make sure that boys can use girls restrooms as they please. But it has been amazing that such people have been demanding that we have to let boys who want to go in little girls bathrooms go in there. If a man wants to go in a little girls bathroom, according to the big popular movement now, for heaven's sake, let's let the man go in the little girls bathroom. North Carolina has taken action consistent with the position of the world since the world began. If you are going to have a multiple-use restroom, normally, you have a female go to a female multiuse restroom, a male go to a male multiuse restroom. This article goes on. It says: ``Republican lawmakers, who make up the majority of North Carolina's General Assembly, publicly unveiled the language of the bill Wednesday morning.'' It goes on and talks about its passage: ``In less than 12 hours''--I am talking about after its passage--``the bill was approved by the house and senate''--or after it was brought forward, the bill was passed, signed by the Governor. Lawmakers in the House voted 83-25 to pass the bill. The Senate approved the bill, 32-0 after Democrats, who make up the minority, walked out of the Chamber in protest. Obviously, they want men to go to little girls restrooms, too. ``Republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from `radical' action by Charlotte.'' ``Critics of Charlotte's ordinance said it could have allowed men who may be sexual offenders to enter a woman's restroom or locker room by claiming a transgender identity.'' Well, critics of the Charlotte ordinance is what the article says, but actually, that is not just a claim; that is a fact. Under what North Carolina was objecting to, if someone who is a sexual offender has decided he wants to go in and meddle in a little girls restroom where he has no business, people like the entertainer that doesn't want to go to North Carolina, they are saying, by golly, you have got to let that man go in that little girls restroom. What has happened to the sense that used to be such a prominent part of this country? I mean, there was a very intelligent man on Fox News, Bill O'Reilly, who actually asked a lawyer on a panel with him on the show: So they passed this law. They don't want men going into the women's restroom, basically, was the crux of it, or boys going in where little girls go. He asked the question, actually: Who are they trying to protect? I couldn't believe that we have come to the point where an intelligent person would have to ask such a stupid question. Whether you agree or disagree with what North Carolina did, whom they were trying to protect, it is almost rhetorical. Clearly, whether you agree or disagree, they were trying to protect the little girls. {time} 1245 It is shocking that anybody would have to ask such a question: Gee, whom are they trying to protect by saying men can't go into girls' restrooms? Incredible. The outrage aimed at North Carolina has just been incredible. I see an article today by Ryan Lovelace from the Washington Examiner: Trump slams North Carolina bathroom law, says state should ``leave it the way it is.'' The way, apparently, Charlotte was going to have it was that men could go in little girls' restrooms. Of course, sexual predators who are male, all they have to do is say they are transgender and they get to go in the little girls' restrooms and wreak the havoc that made them a sexual predator. Whom are they trying to protect in North Carolina? They are trying to protect innocent kids who cannot protect themselves. They count on adults to keep them from harm. It is incredible that people are outraged at North Carolina. Anyone who has children who are female, do you really want men to say: I am transgender and get to go in where your little girl is going to the bathroom, where you can't go because you are not transgender? You are the girl's father. This article says ``What Do Proponents of the Bill Argue?'' It says: ``Republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from `radical' action by Charlotte.'' ``John Rustin, president of the North Carolina Family Policy Council, testified before the Senate, saying that the Charlotte ordinance `means men could enter women restrooms and locker rooms--placing the privacy, safety, and [[Page H1920]] dignity of women and the elderly at great risk.' '' Parenthetically, I noticed an article in recent days, last week, that indicated that one of the leading colleges in pushing for transgender restrooms has had a problem--and it has come up a couple of times-- where men would come in where women were showering, go into the restroom and use their cell phone, hold it up over the stall so they can film or take pictures of the female who was trying to have some privacy in a very personal act of showering or going to the bathroom. What is wrong with saying: Do you know what? When it comes to going to the restroom, females will go to female, males will go to male, and, look, if you want to have a single facility for one person at a time to use or families to use to change diapers or whatever, those are really handy? Those are very helpful. My wife and I have used them ourselves raising girls. It is a handy thing to have. But why condemn North Carolina when they are just trying to protect the privacy of girls? It has already been shown that, if you give guys a chance to say: I am transgender, and I can get to go in and film a girl in a shower, there will be people that do that. Why not let the transgender LGBTQRST--whatever the initials are--let them have their activities where they don't impose upon the privacy of someone who wants to go to the restroom or shower without someone from the opposite sex being there with them? Governor McCrory wrote this statement: ``The basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings, a restroom or locker room, for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of Charlotte . . . As a result, I have signed legislation passed by a bipartisan majority to stop this breach of basic privacy and etiquette which was to go into effect April 1.'' Mr. Speaker, I mentioned that I understand Target may now be changing their restrooms. I will have to double-check because, if they are going to be having women come to men's restrooms, I won't be going to Target to shop unless and until that changes. Usually, Target is great. They have the restroom right there where you go in the door to the store, normally. You don't have to go clear to the back of the store. It is a handy thing. If you have to go shopping, it is handy, but not anymore. Anybody that wants to go to the restroom and have privacy from the opposite sex may need to shop elsewhere. We will have to look at what they have actually done. Anyway, this article seems to make the point that it is not such a crazy thing that North Carolina has done, and that is why for 99.999 percent of human history, since civilization exists since we got past the caveman era, when there have been public restrooms, you recognize there is a difference between males and females. Some day it will be written in the ``Rise and Fall of the United States'' that the greatest, freest, and most powerful country in the history of the world showed symptoms of insanity when it reached the pinnacle of its greatness and success--and this will be one of the symptoms that was written about--that they thought they were so much smarter than civilization for most of our history of the world that a difference was recognized between men and women for purposes of facilities. It is a sad day for the country. Now, I see this article from yesterday that Curt Schilling, an ESPN analyst, was fired over what they deemed as an offensive social media post. Here is what Schilling said: The post showed an overweight man wearing a wig and women's clothing with parts of the T-shirt cut out to expose his chest. It says, ``Let him into the restroom with your daughter or else you are a narrow-minded, judgmental, unloving racist bigot who needs to die.'' Apparently, this kind of thing offends ESPN. Although at one time their job was covering sports, now their job is being social managers, apparently, in making sure that, if men want to go to little girls' restrooms, then we let the men go to little girls' restrooms. This article from yesterday talking about Target stores says: ``Target says transgender customers may use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify.'' How about that. Et tu, Target? So here we are at the place in our history where insanity in the name of political correctness rules the day, common sense is no longer common, and to the point that the current leader in the Republican campaign for President even says that North Carolina should not have taken action that, in essence, says men--which would include sexual predators--should not be allowed to go in women's restrooms. He wanted it left like it was. So if Charlotte wants to say that, if you are a man and you are a sexual predator and you say you are transgender and want to go into the restroom where little girls are, go ahead. That is the position of the leading Republican candidate? I don't know. Hopefully, that will be another one of the positions he will change. But, in the meantime, we need to get common sense back in charge in America while we are still the great country we have been. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Newhouse). Members are reminded not to make reference to guests on the floor of the House. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1916-H1920] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE WEEK IN REVIEW The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I so much appreciate my colleague and friend talking about the Georgia election. We should be encouraging fair elections everywhere and, when they are not fair, calling those to account. Not that we are the policemen of the world, but it becomes so much more unfortunate when you have a nation like Egypt that gets pushed into elections before they are ready, the Muslim Brotherhood takes over the country, as in Egypt when Morsi became President. He began shredding the Constitution and taking more and more power as it happened in Venezuela with Chavez and other countries. He had taken a lesson: This is the way you do it. You get elected, and then you start seizing more and more power. To the credit of the Egyptian people, their story in recent years is the greatest peaceful uprising in the history of the world. It wasn't entirely peaceful because of the violence of the Muslim Brotherhood. They want a world caliphate, and they want to start with something resembling the old Ottoman Empire, that caliphate that came around North Africa and on around the Mediterranean, and they need Egypt in order to make the beginning of the caliphate work. And so they were quite happy when radical Islam, Muslim Brotherhood, took over Egypt through Morsi. But when the Egyptian people, a third of the population, basically--30 million or so of the 90 million there in the nation of Egypt--rose up together, yes, you had Muslims marching with Christians. [[Page H1917]] The Coptic Christian Pope himself has told me more than once how moving it was to have Muslims and Christians and Jews and secularists walking together through the streets in Egypt demanding an end to radical Islamic control, demanding that the President, who was constantly violating the Constitution, be removed. The Coptic Pope told me that it was moving when Muslims, who just wanted peace in Egypt--they didn't want radical Islamic control--would come up to him and apologize for the way that Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood and radical Islamists were acting. And, yes, among Muslims, they are able to recognize that there is a part of Islam--the radical Islamists--that they don't like, but it is a part of Islam. When the administration in this country tells the world that there is no such thing as radical Islam, then they are demeaning and degrading those courageous Muslims who stand up and say: We need to stop radical Islam within Muslims, within the Islamic movement. They actually do damage to the people who want to live in peace. So we are grateful to the people of Egypt for stopping the caliphate before it could be really set in concrete around North Africa and, of course, Syria, all the way around. They want to get back to the old Ottoman Empire and spread and cover the world under the caliphate. It is really most interesting. We have a President who went to elementary school in Muslim school and was trained in Islam in elementary school, and that is the main part of his training on Islam. Because, as we know, he sat under Jeremiah Wright's teaching in church for 20 years or so. So the basic teaching on Islam was in elementary school, whereas there is the ultimate world expert on what is or is not Islam that most of the world recognizes. They don't down the street here, down Pennsylvania Avenue. They don't at the State Department under Secretary Kerry. But most of the world recognizes that a man who got degrees, including his doctor of philosophy, his Ph.D., in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad, is an expert on Islam. He says radical Islam is Islam. He didn't just get a little elementary school training on Islam. He studied Islam his whole life, has a Ph.D. in Islamic studies, and has continued to pour himself into study of the Koran, and he happens to be the head of the Islamic State. {time} 1215 It would seem that if somebody who spent his life studying--rather than just studying Islam in elementary school--says the Islamic State is truly Islam, perhaps the so-called experts in our State Department and our White House ought to listen to that and take notice as well that perhaps maybe it is not as they have been saying, that it is not Islam. It is Islam, but it is a part of Islam, the radical Islamists, and we should be standing against it. So, again, the Iran treaty clearly is a treaty. It needs to be called for what it is: a treaty. And we need to have people in the Senate with courage to step up and say we need a vote on the Iran treaty, because it is a treaty. The Corker bill doesn't apply because it is a treaty. Take the vote. Two-thirds will not vote for it. It will not be confirmed. Then we can call the Iran treaty at an end, because it never was properly agreed to. But in the meantime, since this administration put so much of what credibility it has on the table and at risk by backing the Iran deal, Iran--it may be the run-in leaders, their radical Islamic leaders, want to take over the world. They may be crazy in that regard, they may be power crazy in that regard, but they are very intelligent. You can be crazy and still be highly intelligent. That is how you can be crazy enough to fly a plane into a building and kill thousands of innocent people, but you are intelligent enough to have your engineers look at the plans and figure out what kind of load it would take to bring down a building like the World Trade Center. An article by Joel Pollak from last year--this is last year--and he says: ``In his State of the Union address'' last year, ``President Barack Obama claimed: `Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies, including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.' '' Mr. Pollak's article says: ``None of that is true. The chances of an agreement have dropped sharply, and even the most optimistic analysts do not expect a deal that `prevents a nuclear-armed Iran,' but only one that puts nuclear `breakout' out of reach for a while. Most important of all, we have not `halted the progress' of Iran's nuclear program. Earlier this month, the Tehran regime announced that it was building two new reactors, and is thought to be behind a suspected facility planned in Syria as well. ``In a lengthy essay in Commentary magazine, the invaluable Omri Ceren summarizes the history of President Obama's appeasement of the Iranian's, from the first failed `suckers deal,' as the French called it, through the new veto threats against congressional sanctions. ``The scale of the Obama administration's incompetence is simply daunting. Far from rallying international unity against Iran, President Obama has destroyed it by giving away global demands decades in the making. ``Suddenly, the reason for . . . invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Congress--without consultation from the White House--becomes clear . . . it is not the pro-Israel nature of Congress that drove the Bibi''--Netanyahu--``invitation. It is the fact that Obama''-- Well, it says he misrepresented things, but that is this article. But it goes on to point out that ``there at least five ways in which Iran has explicitly violated the interim agreement'' and spells those out. This is over a year old. They have never stopped violating the agreement--not the interim agreement--they were violating it, the executive agreement that this President entered with Iran. They so much sank their reputation into the Iran treaty that has not been ratified that these constant violations by Iran have the administration defending Iran, sending them money, covering for Iran, making excuses for Iran. This article was from less than a year ago by Cory Bennett from The Hill: ``A diplomatic deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program could inadvertently jumpstart the country's cyber warfare efforts. ``Experts say Tehran might use the economic sanctions relief from the nuclear pact to buttress its growing cyber program, which has already infiltrated critical networks in over a dozen countries, including the U.S.'' So the article goes on to point out: ``We are in a lose-lose situation.'' It is clear to most of us that the Iranian agreement was a huge mistake. They are the largest state supporters of terrorism in the world, and this administration is ongoing right now in giving billions and billions of dollars. And though the Iranian leaders have lied about so many things, when they say that the money that President Obama gives to them, which they don't currently have--the $100 billion to $150 billion in the first year, perhaps $100 billion or so each year after that; it remains to be seen--their Iranian leaders say: We are going to be able to fund more terrorist organizations. That is a statement we should take seriously. That is something that we should believe when they tell us these things. So the President is giving them the money. This article says this week that, of the $3 billion that was recently provided to Iran, this administration can't really tell if they have used it to support additional terrorism or not. But this article that was written in May of last year that the Iran deal could help fund Iran's cyber war, I bring that up now--it is from May 10 of last year from Mr. Bennett--because it was just in the last 4 or 5 months that John Hayward wrote the article: ``Iran Hacks State Department Social Media Accounts.'' We know they have hacked a New York dam Web site. They have explored defenses of the United States Government's Internet. [[Page H1918]] Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to look back and see that, wow, in May of last year, there were reporters that were warning that this deal with Iran may help them in their cyber warfare against us greater than we even know. Then we find out that this administration put a hold on charges against the Iranians that hacked into our government system until after the deal was made so that people didn't raise more of a fuss to try to stop the Iranian treaty. Well, it is still not too late. The Senate could go ahead and take a vote. We know that Harry Reid had said: Gee, there are some low-level confirmations that are so important to the country, we are going to set aside the cloture rule. It only takes 51 votes to do that. Mr. Speaker, I would submit that this Iranian treaty--I keep saying it because it is so critical to the world and to any chance at a semblance of world peace--has to be stopped because it is enriching the largest supporter of terrorism in the world. The Iranian leaders have made clear to the Iranian people that they have no intention of being bound by any agreement with President Obama, John Kerry, or the people here in the U.S. They are still going to do what they want to. So all the Senate has to do is take a vote--51 votes; there are plenty of Republicans to do that--and they might just get some Democrats that are too afraid to be seen as supportive of Iran and this nuclear deal that they may get some Democrat votes. Vote with 51 votes to set aside the cloture rule so you can bring treaty to the floor, have a vote on confirmation--it won't get the two-thirds--and then you would have all kinds of people that should have standing to go into Federal court and put a stop to the billions of dollars that this administration is releasing illegally to Iran. That is, funding--this administration says they know not what--it could be terrorism, they are not sure. I would submit they would--Iran would be supporting terrorism. But here are five things that the article pointed out that they were--even a year ago--breaking the interim agreement: ``Trying to buy equipment for plutonium reactor at Arak, breaking commitment to suspend work. The Obama administration actually complained about the purchases to the U.N. Security Council, even as it told the world that Iran had `lived up to its end of the bargain.' '' They are ``feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into a plant where it had agreed to suspend nuclear enrichment. The Institute for Science and International Security noted that Iran had begun enrichment at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz. It notified the Obama administration, which complained to the Iranians, which then claimed to have stop the enrichment activity.'' Three: ``Withholding camera footage of nuclear facilities, defying the International Atomic Energy Agency. A leading International Atomic Energy Agency official recently said the agency was `not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran' . . . The interim deal was to provide surveillance footage of Iranian nuclear facilities, but Iran has only provided would what it wants to reveal.'' And that is consistent with what Steve King and I and a couple of other Members were told by the IAEA inspectors who were in charge of inspecting Iran, that they can only go by what they are given. They are not given access to military facilities. They are not being given this footage. I am very proud to yield to my dear friend from Kentucky (Mr. Massie), a proud graduate of MIT on the floor. Mr. MASSIE. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding to me. This is a very interesting topic that you are speaking on, and I have never had the chance on the floor to explain my feelings on this vote nor the reason why I voted as I did on the Iran bill. So I appreciate the opportunity to say a little bit about this. Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that the gentleman from Texas is basically qualifying the Iran deal as a treaty, and I agree with that position. In fact, I believe I was the only Congressman to vote ``present'' on that bill. And the reason that I did vote ``present''--I just wanted a chance to clarify this--is that I felt that it was a treaty. I know a lot of us felt that way and we had different ways of dealing with that vote, but I voted ``present'' to indicate it was a treaty and that it really shouldn't have even been here in the House of Representatives. {time} 1230 According to the Constitution, only the Senate shall agree to the treaties, and not the House. We shouldn't really have a say in that. So I just wanted the opportunity, and I appreciate the gentleman from Texas giving me this opportunity, to explain the reason that I voted ``present.'' I think it was only the second time since I have been in Congress, and it was for a constitutional reason. I felt strongly that was a treaty. I thank the gentleman from Texas for this opportunity. Mr. GOHMERT. If the gentleman would hang on for a moment, I voted for the bill, but I did not feel like it adequately dealt with the issue that my friend from Kentucky raised, but I completely respect that position. Since the gentleman from Kentucky and I have had a lot of discussions about Iran and the Iranian treaty and his feelings, I have always felt that his vote, ``present,'' made eminent sense, was consistent with our position. Really, the vote on what we took didn't really matter so much as the point that the gentleman has just made. This is a treaty. The Senate needs to vote on it. Our vote, though nice, was not particularly relevant to the fact that it is a treaty. I would like to ask, if the gentleman would yield for a question, because I saw that there was a handsome young man in a blue shirt that came in with him, and wondered if he might identify who has accompanied him onto the floor. Mr. MASSIE. As the gentleman from Texas knows, we are allowed to bring younger constituents and visitors, and we have a visitor from Kentucky; that is true. His name is Joe. Mr. GOHMERT. I thought perhaps he might be from Kentucky. Mr. MASSIE. His name is Joe. Mr. GOHMERT. That is wonderful. He looks quite comfortable here on the floor, looks like he would be a good fit some day. I thank my friend for making that point. The vote that we took last year pointed out that the Iranians had not complied; the administration had not complied, as I recall, with the requirements to provide proper information. But the gentleman from Kentucky is exactly right. The real issue was a vote in the Senate on it being a treaty. The Senate has not yet voted on the Iranian treaty as a treaty, and if they would do that, when it didn't get the two-thirds votes, then we could stop the outrage of sending billions of dollars to a country that has a massive amount of American, precious American blood on its hands because of the way in which they have funded terrorism. They were the largest provider of IEDs when Americans were fighting for Muslim freedom in Iraq, and yet Iran continued to build and furnish IEDs. It needs to be dealt with. People are suffering in the world. Mr. Speaker, I mentioned Egypt, and what a great day for world history when a third of the population rose up, 30 million people that had never risen up in the history of the world, in peaceful demonstration, despite the Muslim Brotherhood's violence to try to make it appear otherwise. They had never risen up like those people did in Egypt. They are to be commended. I would humbly submit that if this administration would help Egypt and be the friend to Egypt that it is being in helping Iran and providing money to Iran, then the world would be a far better place than it is with all the help that this administration is providing to Iran. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the ultimate result of the Clinton, Wendy Sherman deal with North Korea, in which, in essence, the Clinton administration says: Hey, we will give you nuclear--we will let you have nuclear power. We will give you what you need to have if you will just sign and say you won't ever use it to develop nukes. And then, big shocker for some in the Democratic administration--it wasn't [[Page H1919]] to most of us that were watching from afar in different places in the United States--North Korea lied. They did use what we provided to create nuclear weapons, and now the world is a much less safe place. So I have no doubt that someday, maybe, some Iranian will kill me; but somebody will be here on the floor, if the Capitol still exists, and will point out that this deal that Obama and Kerry and Wendy Sherman did with Iran, in allowing them to move forward with nuclear activity, providing them with $100 billion or so to start off, hundreds of billions in the future, that they ended up lying when they said they agreed, initially, to the agreement--even though they have said publicly: We are not going to abide by it--that they ended up using results from the Obama administration's treaty to develop nuclear weapons, and that, just like the Clinton-Albright-Sherman deal with North Korea, the Obama-Kerry-Sherman deal with Iran has resulted in Iran having nukes sooner than they would have otherwise, despite the promises previously by the Obama administration to prevent Iran from having nukes. Actually, they helped them get the nukes. North Carolina's Passage of House Bill 2 Mr. GOHMERT. I want to turn to one other subject that has been very controversial--North Carolina has gotten a bad rap--and this article from ABC News, ``North Carolina's Controversial `Anti-LGBT' Bill Explained.'' The article says: ``Several civil rights groups and LGBTQ advocates are organizing a rally tonight in Raleigh''--this is from March 24 of this year--``North Carolina, to protest the State's controversial passage of its House Bill 2, which critics have called `the most anti- LGBT bill in the country.' '' The article says: ``Here's everything you need to know about the bill, also known as The Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, which was signed into law by Governor Pat McCrory on Wednesday. ``What does it do? ``House Bill 2 declares that State law overrides all local ordinances concerning wages, employment, and public accommodations.'' ``Thus, the law now bars local municipalities from creating their own rules prohibiting discrimination in public places based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Though North Carolina does have a statewide nondiscrimination law, it does not include specific protections for LGBTQ people.'' We keep adding letters, you know. We kept adding letters until we got to LGBT, and now we have added Q. ``The law also directs all public schools, government agencies, and public college campuses to require that multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities, such as locker rooms, be designated for use only by people based on their `biological sex' stated on their birth certificate. Transgender people can use the bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their gender identity only if they get the biological sex on their birth certificate changed.'' ``Under the law, public institutions can still offer single-occupancy facilities.'' And nobody has a problem with that. If you have got a single bathroom facility that has just got one facility for going to the bathroom, that is fine. It can be for whoever needs to use it. But they are saying, as has been consistent with the history of the world for most of the world's existence, that if you, according to documentation, are a female, you use the female restroom when it is for multiple people's use at the same time; and if, by documentation, you are a male, you use the male facilities. It has really been shocking to see how many people, including singers and entertainers and different groups--I understand Target now wants to make sure that boys can use girls restrooms as they please. But it has been amazing that such people have been demanding that we have to let boys who want to go in little girls bathrooms go in there. If a man wants to go in a little girls bathroom, according to the big popular movement now, for heaven's sake, let's let the man go in the little girls bathroom. North Carolina has taken action consistent with the position of the world since the world began. If you are going to have a multiple-use restroom, normally, you have a female go to a female multiuse restroom, a male go to a male multiuse restroom. This article goes on. It says: ``Republican lawmakers, who make up the majority of North Carolina's General Assembly, publicly unveiled the language of the bill Wednesday morning.'' It goes on and talks about its passage: ``In less than 12 hours''--I am talking about after its passage--``the bill was approved by the house and senate''--or after it was brought forward, the bill was passed, signed by the Governor. Lawmakers in the House voted 83-25 to pass the bill. The Senate approved the bill, 32-0 after Democrats, who make up the minority, walked out of the Chamber in protest. Obviously, they want men to go to little girls restrooms, too. ``Republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from `radical' action by Charlotte.'' ``Critics of Charlotte's ordinance said it could have allowed men who may be sexual offenders to enter a woman's restroom or locker room by claiming a transgender identity.'' Well, critics of the Charlotte ordinance is what the article says, but actually, that is not just a claim; that is a fact. Under what North Carolina was objecting to, if someone who is a sexual offender has decided he wants to go in and meddle in a little girls restroom where he has no business, people like the entertainer that doesn't want to go to North Carolina, they are saying, by golly, you have got to let that man go in that little girls restroom. What has happened to the sense that used to be such a prominent part of this country? I mean, there was a very intelligent man on Fox News, Bill O'Reilly, who actually asked a lawyer on a panel with him on the show: So they passed this law. They don't want men going into the women's restroom, basically, was the crux of it, or boys going in where little girls go. He asked the question, actually: Who are they trying to protect? I couldn't believe that we have come to the point where an intelligent person would have to ask such a stupid question. Whether you agree or disagree with what North Carolina did, whom they were trying to protect, it is almost rhetorical. Clearly, whether you agree or disagree, they were trying to protect the little girls. {time} 1245 It is shocking that anybody would have to ask such a question: Gee, whom are they trying to protect by saying men can't go into girls' restrooms? Incredible. The outrage aimed at North Carolina has just been incredible. I see an article today by Ryan Lovelace from the Washington Examiner: Trump slams North Carolina bathroom law, says state should ``leave it the way it is.'' The way, apparently, Charlotte was going to have it was that men could go in little girls' restrooms. Of course, sexual predators who are male, all they have to do is say they are transgender and they get to go in the little girls' restrooms and wreak the havoc that made them a sexual predator. Whom are they trying to protect in North Carolina? They are trying to protect innocent kids who cannot protect themselves. They count on adults to keep them from harm. It is incredible that people are outraged at North Carolina. Anyone who has children who are female, do you really want men to say: I am transgender and get to go in where your little girl is going to the bathroom, where you can't go because you are not transgender? You are the girl's father. This article says ``What Do Proponents of the Bill Argue?'' It says: ``Republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from `radical' action by Charlotte.'' ``John Rustin, president of the North Carolina Family Policy Council, testified before the Senate, saying that the Charlotte ordinance `means men could enter women restrooms and locker rooms--placing the privacy, safety, and [[Page H1920]] dignity of women and the elderly at great risk.' '' Parenthetically, I noticed an article in recent days, last week, that indicated that one of the leading colleges in pushing for transgender restrooms has had a problem--and it has come up a couple of times-- where men would come in where women were showering, go into the restroom and use their cell phone, hold it up over the stall so they can film or take pictures of the female who was trying to have some privacy in a very personal act of showering or going to the bathroom. What is wrong with saying: Do you know what? When it comes to going to the restroom, females will go to female, males will go to male, and, look, if you want to have a single facility for one person at a time to use or families to use to change diapers or whatever, those are really handy? Those are very helpful. My wife and I have used them ourselves raising girls. It is a handy thing to have. But why condemn North Carolina when they are just trying to protect the privacy of girls? It has already been shown that, if you give guys a chance to say: I am transgender, and I can get to go in and film a girl in a shower, there will be people that do that. Why not let the transgender LGBTQRST--whatever the initials are--let them have their activities where they don't impose upon the privacy of someone who wants to go to the restroom or shower without someone from the opposite sex being there with them? Governor McCrory wrote this statement: ``The basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings, a restroom or locker room, for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of Charlotte . . . As a result, I have signed legislation passed by a bipartisan majority to stop this breach of basic privacy and etiquette which was to go into effect April 1.'' Mr. Speaker, I mentioned that I understand Target may now be changing their restrooms. I will have to double-check because, if they are going to be having women come to men's restrooms, I won't be going to Target to shop unless and until that changes. Usually, Target is great. They have the restroom right there where you go in the door to the store, normally. You don't have to go clear to the back of the store. It is a handy thing. If you have to go shopping, it is handy, but not anymore. Anybody that wants to go to the restroom and have privacy from the opposite sex may need to shop elsewhere. We will have to look at what they have actually done. Anyway, this article seems to make the point that it is not such a crazy thing that North Carolina has done, and that is why for 99.999 percent of human history, since civilization exists since we got past the caveman era, when there have been public restrooms, you recognize there is a difference between males and females. Some day it will be written in the ``Rise and Fall of the United States'' that the greatest, freest, and most powerful country in the history of the world showed symptoms of insanity when it reached the pinnacle of its greatness and success--and this will be one of the symptoms that was written about--that they thought they were so much smarter than civilization for most of our history of the world that a difference was recognized between men and women for purposes of facilities. It is a sad day for the country. Now, I see this article from yesterday that Curt Schilling, an ESPN analyst, was fired over what they deemed as an offensive social media post. Here is what Schilling said: The post showed an overweight man wearing a wig and women's clothing with parts of the T-shirt cut out to expose his chest. It says, ``Let him into the restroom with your daughter or else you are a narrow-minded, judgmental, unloving racist bigot who needs to die.'' Apparently, this kind of thing offends ESPN. Although at one time their job was covering sports, now their job is being social managers, apparently, in making sure that, if men want to go to little girls' restrooms, then we let the men go to little girls' restrooms. This article from yesterday talking about Target stores says: ``Target says transgender customers may use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify.'' How about that. Et tu, Target? So here we are at the place in our history where insanity in the name of political correctness rules the day, common sense is no longer common, and to the point that the current leader in the Republican campaign for President even says that North Carolina should not have taken action that, in essence, says men--which would include sexual predators--should not be allowed to go in women's restrooms. He wanted it left like it was. So if Charlotte wants to say that, if you are a man and you are a sexual predator and you say you are transgender and want to go into the restroom where little girls are, go ahead. That is the position of the leading Republican candidate? I don't know. Hopefully, that will be another one of the positions he will change. But, in the meantime, we need to get common sense back in charge in America while we are still the great country we have been. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Newhouse). Members are reminded not to make reference to guests on the floor of the House. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1916-H1920] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE WEEK IN REVIEW The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I so much appreciate my colleague and friend talking about the Georgia election. We should be encouraging fair elections everywhere and, when they are not fair, calling those to account. Not that we are the policemen of the world, but it becomes so much more unfortunate when you have a nation like Egypt that gets pushed into elections before they are ready, the Muslim Brotherhood takes over the country, as in Egypt when Morsi became President. He began shredding the Constitution and taking more and more power as it happened in Venezuela with Chavez and other countries. He had taken a lesson: This is the way you do it. You get elected, and then you start seizing more and more power. To the credit of the Egyptian people, their story in recent years is the greatest peaceful uprising in the history of the world. It wasn't entirely peaceful because of the violence of the Muslim Brotherhood. They want a world caliphate, and they want to start with something resembling the old Ottoman Empire, that caliphate that came around North Africa and on around the Mediterranean, and they need Egypt in order to make the beginning of the caliphate work. And so they were quite happy when radical Islam, Muslim Brotherhood, took over Egypt through Morsi. But when the Egyptian people, a third of the population, basically--30 million or so of the 90 million there in the nation of Egypt--rose up together, yes, you had Muslims marching with Christians. [[Page H1917]] The Coptic Christian Pope himself has told me more than once how moving it was to have Muslims and Christians and Jews and secularists walking together through the streets in Egypt demanding an end to radical Islamic control, demanding that the President, who was constantly violating the Constitution, be removed. The Coptic Pope told me that it was moving when Muslims, who just wanted peace in Egypt--they didn't want radical Islamic control--would come up to him and apologize for the way that Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood and radical Islamists were acting. And, yes, among Muslims, they are able to recognize that there is a part of Islam--the radical Islamists--that they don't like, but it is a part of Islam. When the administration in this country tells the world that there is no such thing as radical Islam, then they are demeaning and degrading those courageous Muslims who stand up and say: We need to stop radical Islam within Muslims, within the Islamic movement. They actually do damage to the people who want to live in peace. So we are grateful to the people of Egypt for stopping the caliphate before it could be really set in concrete around North Africa and, of course, Syria, all the way around. They want to get back to the old Ottoman Empire and spread and cover the world under the caliphate. It is really most interesting. We have a President who went to elementary school in Muslim school and was trained in Islam in elementary school, and that is the main part of his training on Islam. Because, as we know, he sat under Jeremiah Wright's teaching in church for 20 years or so. So the basic teaching on Islam was in elementary school, whereas there is the ultimate world expert on what is or is not Islam that most of the world recognizes. They don't down the street here, down Pennsylvania Avenue. They don't at the State Department under Secretary Kerry. But most of the world recognizes that a man who got degrees, including his doctor of philosophy, his Ph.D., in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad, is an expert on Islam. He says radical Islam is Islam. He didn't just get a little elementary school training on Islam. He studied Islam his whole life, has a Ph.D. in Islamic studies, and has continued to pour himself into study of the Koran, and he happens to be the head of the Islamic State. {time} 1215 It would seem that if somebody who spent his life studying--rather than just studying Islam in elementary school--says the Islamic State is truly Islam, perhaps the so-called experts in our State Department and our White House ought to listen to that and take notice as well that perhaps maybe it is not as they have been saying, that it is not Islam. It is Islam, but it is a part of Islam, the radical Islamists, and we should be standing against it. So, again, the Iran treaty clearly is a treaty. It needs to be called for what it is: a treaty. And we need to have people in the Senate with courage to step up and say we need a vote on the Iran treaty, because it is a treaty. The Corker bill doesn't apply because it is a treaty. Take the vote. Two-thirds will not vote for it. It will not be confirmed. Then we can call the Iran treaty at an end, because it never was properly agreed to. But in the meantime, since this administration put so much of what credibility it has on the table and at risk by backing the Iran deal, Iran--it may be the run-in leaders, their radical Islamic leaders, want to take over the world. They may be crazy in that regard, they may be power crazy in that regard, but they are very intelligent. You can be crazy and still be highly intelligent. That is how you can be crazy enough to fly a plane into a building and kill thousands of innocent people, but you are intelligent enough to have your engineers look at the plans and figure out what kind of load it would take to bring down a building like the World Trade Center. An article by Joel Pollak from last year--this is last year--and he says: ``In his State of the Union address'' last year, ``President Barack Obama claimed: `Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies, including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.' '' Mr. Pollak's article says: ``None of that is true. The chances of an agreement have dropped sharply, and even the most optimistic analysts do not expect a deal that `prevents a nuclear-armed Iran,' but only one that puts nuclear `breakout' out of reach for a while. Most important of all, we have not `halted the progress' of Iran's nuclear program. Earlier this month, the Tehran regime announced that it was building two new reactors, and is thought to be behind a suspected facility planned in Syria as well. ``In a lengthy essay in Commentary magazine, the invaluable Omri Ceren summarizes the history of President Obama's appeasement of the Iranian's, from the first failed `suckers deal,' as the French called it, through the new veto threats against congressional sanctions. ``The scale of the Obama administration's incompetence is simply daunting. Far from rallying international unity against Iran, President Obama has destroyed it by giving away global demands decades in the making. ``Suddenly, the reason for . . . invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Congress--without consultation from the White House--becomes clear . . . it is not the pro-Israel nature of Congress that drove the Bibi''--Netanyahu--``invitation. It is the fact that Obama''-- Well, it says he misrepresented things, but that is this article. But it goes on to point out that ``there at least five ways in which Iran has explicitly violated the interim agreement'' and spells those out. This is over a year old. They have never stopped violating the agreement--not the interim agreement--they were violating it, the executive agreement that this President entered with Iran. They so much sank their reputation into the Iran treaty that has not been ratified that these constant violations by Iran have the administration defending Iran, sending them money, covering for Iran, making excuses for Iran. This article was from less than a year ago by Cory Bennett from The Hill: ``A diplomatic deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program could inadvertently jumpstart the country's cyber warfare efforts. ``Experts say Tehran might use the economic sanctions relief from the nuclear pact to buttress its growing cyber program, which has already infiltrated critical networks in over a dozen countries, including the U.S.'' So the article goes on to point out: ``We are in a lose-lose situation.'' It is clear to most of us that the Iranian agreement was a huge mistake. They are the largest state supporters of terrorism in the world, and this administration is ongoing right now in giving billions and billions of dollars. And though the Iranian leaders have lied about so many things, when they say that the money that President Obama gives to them, which they don't currently have--the $100 billion to $150 billion in the first year, perhaps $100 billion or so each year after that; it remains to be seen--their Iranian leaders say: We are going to be able to fund more terrorist organizations. That is a statement we should take seriously. That is something that we should believe when they tell us these things. So the President is giving them the money. This article says this week that, of the $3 billion that was recently provided to Iran, this administration can't really tell if they have used it to support additional terrorism or not. But this article that was written in May of last year that the Iran deal could help fund Iran's cyber war, I bring that up now--it is from May 10 of last year from Mr. Bennett--because it was just in the last 4 or 5 months that John Hayward wrote the article: ``Iran Hacks State Department Social Media Accounts.'' We know they have hacked a New York dam Web site. They have explored defenses of the United States Government's Internet. [[Page H1918]] Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to look back and see that, wow, in May of last year, there were reporters that were warning that this deal with Iran may help them in their cyber warfare against us greater than we even know. Then we find out that this administration put a hold on charges against the Iranians that hacked into our government system until after the deal was made so that people didn't raise more of a fuss to try to stop the Iranian treaty. Well, it is still not too late. The Senate could go ahead and take a vote. We know that Harry Reid had said: Gee, there are some low-level confirmations that are so important to the country, we are going to set aside the cloture rule. It only takes 51 votes to do that. Mr. Speaker, I would submit that this Iranian treaty--I keep saying it because it is so critical to the world and to any chance at a semblance of world peace--has to be stopped because it is enriching the largest supporter of terrorism in the world. The Iranian leaders have made clear to the Iranian people that they have no intention of being bound by any agreement with President Obama, John Kerry, or the people here in the U.S. They are still going to do what they want to. So all the Senate has to do is take a vote--51 votes; there are plenty of Republicans to do that--and they might just get some Democrats that are too afraid to be seen as supportive of Iran and this nuclear deal that they may get some Democrat votes. Vote with 51 votes to set aside the cloture rule so you can bring treaty to the floor, have a vote on confirmation--it won't get the two-thirds--and then you would have all kinds of people that should have standing to go into Federal court and put a stop to the billions of dollars that this administration is releasing illegally to Iran. That is, funding--this administration says they know not what--it could be terrorism, they are not sure. I would submit they would--Iran would be supporting terrorism. But here are five things that the article pointed out that they were--even a year ago--breaking the interim agreement: ``Trying to buy equipment for plutonium reactor at Arak, breaking commitment to suspend work. The Obama administration actually complained about the purchases to the U.N. Security Council, even as it told the world that Iran had `lived up to its end of the bargain.' '' They are ``feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into a plant where it had agreed to suspend nuclear enrichment. The Institute for Science and International Security noted that Iran had begun enrichment at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz. It notified the Obama administration, which complained to the Iranians, which then claimed to have stop the enrichment activity.'' Three: ``Withholding camera footage of nuclear facilities, defying the International Atomic Energy Agency. A leading International Atomic Energy Agency official recently said the agency was `not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran' . . . The interim deal was to provide surveillance footage of Iranian nuclear facilities, but Iran has only provided would what it wants to reveal.'' And that is consistent with what Steve King and I and a couple of other Members were told by the IAEA inspectors who were in charge of inspecting Iran, that they can only go by what they are given. They are not given access to military facilities. They are not being given this footage. I am very proud to yield to my dear friend from Kentucky (Mr. Massie), a proud graduate of MIT on the floor. Mr. MASSIE. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding to me. This is a very interesting topic that you are speaking on, and I have never had the chance on the floor to explain my feelings on this vote nor the reason why I voted as I did on the Iran bill. So I appreciate the opportunity to say a little bit about this. Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that the gentleman from Texas is basically qualifying the Iran deal as a treaty, and I agree with that position. In fact, I believe I was the only Congressman to vote ``present'' on that bill. And the reason that I did vote ``present''--I just wanted a chance to clarify this--is that I felt that it was a treaty. I know a lot of us felt that way and we had different ways of dealing with that vote, but I voted ``present'' to indicate it was a treaty and that it really shouldn't have even been here in the House of Representatives. {time} 1230 According to the Constitution, only the Senate shall agree to the treaties, and not the House. We shouldn't really have a say in that. So I just wanted the opportunity, and I appreciate the gentleman from Texas giving me this opportunity, to explain the reason that I voted ``present.'' I think it was only the second time since I have been in Congress, and it was for a constitutional reason. I felt strongly that was a treaty. I thank the gentleman from Texas for this opportunity. Mr. GOHMERT. If the gentleman would hang on for a moment, I voted for the bill, but I did not feel like it adequately dealt with the issue that my friend from Kentucky raised, but I completely respect that position. Since the gentleman from Kentucky and I have had a lot of discussions about Iran and the Iranian treaty and his feelings, I have always felt that his vote, ``present,'' made eminent sense, was consistent with our position. Really, the vote on what we took didn't really matter so much as the point that the gentleman has just made. This is a treaty. The Senate needs to vote on it. Our vote, though nice, was not particularly relevant to the fact that it is a treaty. I would like to ask, if the gentleman would yield for a question, because I saw that there was a handsome young man in a blue shirt that came in with him, and wondered if he might identify who has accompanied him onto the floor. Mr. MASSIE. As the gentleman from Texas knows, we are allowed to bring younger constituents and visitors, and we have a visitor from Kentucky; that is true. His name is Joe. Mr. GOHMERT. I thought perhaps he might be from Kentucky. Mr. MASSIE. His name is Joe. Mr. GOHMERT. That is wonderful. He looks quite comfortable here on the floor, looks like he would be a good fit some day. I thank my friend for making that point. The vote that we took last year pointed out that the Iranians had not complied; the administration had not complied, as I recall, with the requirements to provide proper information. But the gentleman from Kentucky is exactly right. The real issue was a vote in the Senate on it being a treaty. The Senate has not yet voted on the Iranian treaty as a treaty, and if they would do that, when it didn't get the two-thirds votes, then we could stop the outrage of sending billions of dollars to a country that has a massive amount of American, precious American blood on its hands because of the way in which they have funded terrorism. They were the largest provider of IEDs when Americans were fighting for Muslim freedom in Iraq, and yet Iran continued to build and furnish IEDs. It needs to be dealt with. People are suffering in the world. Mr. Speaker, I mentioned Egypt, and what a great day for world history when a third of the population rose up, 30 million people that had never risen up in the history of the world, in peaceful demonstration, despite the Muslim Brotherhood's violence to try to make it appear otherwise. They had never risen up like those people did in Egypt. They are to be commended. I would humbly submit that if this administration would help Egypt and be the friend to Egypt that it is being in helping Iran and providing money to Iran, then the world would be a far better place than it is with all the help that this administration is providing to Iran. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the ultimate result of the Clinton, Wendy Sherman deal with North Korea, in which, in essence, the Clinton administration says: Hey, we will give you nuclear--we will let you have nuclear power. We will give you what you need to have if you will just sign and say you won't ever use it to develop nukes. And then, big shocker for some in the Democratic administration--it wasn't [[Page H1919]] to most of us that were watching from afar in different places in the United States--North Korea lied. They did use what we provided to create nuclear weapons, and now the world is a much less safe place. So I have no doubt that someday, maybe, some Iranian will kill me; but somebody will be here on the floor, if the Capitol still exists, and will point out that this deal that Obama and Kerry and Wendy Sherman did with Iran, in allowing them to move forward with nuclear activity, providing them with $100 billion or so to start off, hundreds of billions in the future, that they ended up lying when they said they agreed, initially, to the agreement--even though they have said publicly: We are not going to abide by it--that they ended up using results from the Obama administration's treaty to develop nuclear weapons, and that, just like the Clinton-Albright-Sherman deal with North Korea, the Obama-Kerry-Sherman deal with Iran has resulted in Iran having nukes sooner than they would have otherwise, despite the promises previously by the Obama administration to prevent Iran from having nukes. Actually, they helped them get the nukes. North Carolina's Passage of House Bill 2 Mr. GOHMERT. I want to turn to one other subject that has been very controversial--North Carolina has gotten a bad rap--and this article from ABC News, ``North Carolina's Controversial `Anti-LGBT' Bill Explained.'' The article says: ``Several civil rights groups and LGBTQ advocates are organizing a rally tonight in Raleigh''--this is from March 24 of this year--``North Carolina, to protest the State's controversial passage of its House Bill 2, which critics have called `the most anti- LGBT bill in the country.' '' The article says: ``Here's everything you need to know about the bill, also known as The Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, which was signed into law by Governor Pat McCrory on Wednesday. ``What does it do? ``House Bill 2 declares that State law overrides all local ordinances concerning wages, employment, and public accommodations.'' ``Thus, the law now bars local municipalities from creating their own rules prohibiting discrimination in public places based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Though North Carolina does have a statewide nondiscrimination law, it does not include specific protections for LGBTQ people.'' We keep adding letters, you know. We kept adding letters until we got to LGBT, and now we have added Q. ``The law also directs all public schools, government agencies, and public college campuses to require that multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities, such as locker rooms, be designated for use only by people based on their `biological sex' stated on their birth certificate. Transgender people can use the bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their gender identity only if they get the biological sex on their birth certificate changed.'' ``Under the law, public institutions can still offer single-occupancy facilities.'' And nobody has a problem with that. If you have got a single bathroom facility that has just got one facility for going to the bathroom, that is fine. It can be for whoever needs to use it. But they are saying, as has been consistent with the history of the world for most of the world's existence, that if you, according to documentation, are a female, you use the female restroom when it is for multiple people's use at the same time; and if, by documentation, you are a male, you use the male facilities. It has really been shocking to see how many people, including singers and entertainers and different groups--I understand Target now wants to make sure that boys can use girls restrooms as they please. But it has been amazing that such people have been demanding that we have to let boys who want to go in little girls bathrooms go in there. If a man wants to go in a little girls bathroom, according to the big popular movement now, for heaven's sake, let's let the man go in the little girls bathroom. North Carolina has taken action consistent with the position of the world since the world began. If you are going to have a multiple-use restroom, normally, you have a female go to a female multiuse restroom, a male go to a male multiuse restroom. This article goes on. It says: ``Republican lawmakers, who make up the majority of North Carolina's General Assembly, publicly unveiled the language of the bill Wednesday morning.'' It goes on and talks about its passage: ``In less than 12 hours''--I am talking about after its passage--``the bill was approved by the house and senate''--or after it was brought forward, the bill was passed, signed by the Governor. Lawmakers in the House voted 83-25 to pass the bill. The Senate approved the bill, 32-0 after Democrats, who make up the minority, walked out of the Chamber in protest. Obviously, they want men to go to little girls restrooms, too. ``Republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from `radical' action by Charlotte.'' ``Critics of Charlotte's ordinance said it could have allowed men who may be sexual offenders to enter a woman's restroom or locker room by claiming a transgender identity.'' Well, critics of the Charlotte ordinance is what the article says, but actually, that is not just a claim; that is a fact. Under what North Carolina was objecting to, if someone who is a sexual offender has decided he wants to go in and meddle in a little girls restroom where he has no business, people like the entertainer that doesn't want to go to North Carolina, they are saying, by golly, you have got to let that man go in that little girls restroom. What has happened to the sense that used to be such a prominent part of this country? I mean, there was a very intelligent man on Fox News, Bill O'Reilly, who actually asked a lawyer on a panel with him on the show: So they passed this law. They don't want men going into the women's restroom, basically, was the crux of it, or boys going in where little girls go. He asked the question, actually: Who are they trying to protect? I couldn't believe that we have come to the point where an intelligent person would have to ask such a stupid question. Whether you agree or disagree with what North Carolina did, whom they were trying to protect, it is almost rhetorical. Clearly, whether you agree or disagree, they were trying to protect the little girls. {time} 1245 It is shocking that anybody would have to ask such a question: Gee, whom are they trying to protect by saying men can't go into girls' restrooms? Incredible. The outrage aimed at North Carolina has just been incredible. I see an article today by Ryan Lovelace from the Washington Examiner: Trump slams North Carolina bathroom law, says state should ``leave it the way it is.'' The way, apparently, Charlotte was going to have it was that men could go in little girls' restrooms. Of course, sexual predators who are male, all they have to do is say they are transgender and they get to go in the little girls' restrooms and wreak the havoc that made them a sexual predator. Whom are they trying to protect in North Carolina? They are trying to protect innocent kids who cannot protect themselves. They count on adults to keep them from harm. It is incredible that people are outraged at North Carolina. Anyone who has children who are female, do you really want men to say: I am transgender and get to go in where your little girl is going to the bathroom, where you can't go because you are not transgender? You are the girl's father. This article says ``What Do Proponents of the Bill Argue?'' It says: ``Republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from `radical' action by Charlotte.'' ``John Rustin, president of the North Carolina Family Policy Council, testified before the Senate, saying that the Charlotte ordinance `means men could enter women restrooms and locker rooms--placing the privacy, safety, and [[Page H1920]] dignity of women and the elderly at great risk.' '' Parenthetically, I noticed an article in recent days, last week, that indicated that one of the leading colleges in pushing for transgender restrooms has had a problem--and it has come up a couple of times-- where men would come in where women were showering, go into the restroom and use their cell phone, hold it up over the stall so they can film or take pictures of the female who was trying to have some privacy in a very personal act of showering or going to the bathroom. What is wrong with saying: Do you know what? When it comes to going to the restroom, females will go to female, males will go to male, and, look, if you want to have a single facility for one person at a time to use or families to use to change diapers or whatever, those are really handy? Those are very helpful. My wife and I have used them ourselves raising girls. It is a handy thing to have. But why condemn North Carolina when they are just trying to protect the privacy of girls? It has already been shown that, if you give guys a chance to say: I am transgender, and I can get to go in and film a girl in a shower, there will be people that do that. Why not let the transgender LGBTQRST--whatever the initials are--let them have their activities where they don't impose upon the privacy of someone who wants to go to the restroom or shower without someone from the opposite sex being there with them? Governor McCrory wrote this statement: ``The basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings, a restroom or locker room, for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of Charlotte . . . As a result, I have signed legislation passed by a bipartisan majority to stop this breach of basic privacy and etiquette which was to go into effect April 1.'' Mr. Speaker, I mentioned that I understand Target may now be changing their restrooms. I will have to double-check because, if they are going to be having women come to men's restrooms, I won't be going to Target to shop unless and until that changes. Usually, Target is great. They have the restroom right there where you go in the door to the store, normally. You don't have to go clear to the back of the store. It is a handy thing. If you have to go shopping, it is handy, but not anymore. Anybody that wants to go to the restroom and have privacy from the opposite sex may need to shop elsewhere. We will have to look at what they have actually done. Anyway, this article seems to make the point that it is not such a crazy thing that North Carolina has done, and that is why for 99.999 percent of human history, since civilization exists since we got past the caveman era, when there have been public restrooms, you recognize there is a difference between males and females. Some day it will be written in the ``Rise and Fall of the United States'' that the greatest, freest, and most powerful country in the history of the world showed symptoms of insanity when it reached the pinnacle of its greatness and success--and this will be one of the symptoms that was written about--that they thought they were so much smarter than civilization for most of our history of the world that a difference was recognized between men and women for purposes of facilities. It is a sad day for the country. Now, I see this article from yesterday that Curt Schilling, an ESPN analyst, was fired over what they deemed as an offensive social media post. Here is what Schilling said: The post showed an overweight man wearing a wig and women's clothing with parts of the T-shirt cut out to expose his chest. It says, ``Let him into the restroom with your daughter or else you are a narrow-minded, judgmental, unloving racist bigot who needs to die.'' Apparently, this kind of thing offends ESPN. Although at one time their job was covering sports, now their job is being social managers, apparently, in making sure that, if men want to go to little girls' restrooms, then we let the men go to little girls' restrooms. This article from yesterday talking about Target stores says: ``Target says transgender customers may use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify.'' How about that. Et tu, Target? So here we are at the place in our history where insanity in the name of political correctness rules the day, common sense is no longer common, and to the point that the current leader in the Republican campaign for President even says that North Carolina should not have taken action that, in essence, says men--which would include sexual predators--should not be allowed to go in women's restrooms. He wanted it left like it was. So if Charlotte wants to say that, if you are a man and you are a sexual predator and you say you are transgender and want to go into the restroom where little girls are, go ahead. That is the position of the leading Republican candidate? I don't know. Hopefully, that will be another one of the positions he will change. But, in the meantime, we need to get common sense back in charge in America while we are still the great country we have been. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Newhouse). Members are reminded not to make reference to guests on the floor of the House. ____________________",package_114_168.csv,31817,31817,31886,"[congressional record volume 162, number 62 (thursday, april 21, 2016)] [house] [pages h1916-h1920] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] the week in review the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, i so much appreciate my colleague and friend talking about the georgia election. we should be encouraging fair elections everywhere and, when they are not fair, calling those to account. not that we are the policemen of the world, but it becomes so much more unfortunate when you have a nation like egypt that gets pushed into elections before they are ready, the muslim brotherhood takes over the country, as in egypt when morsi became president. he began shredding the constitution and taking more and more power as it happened in venezuela with chavez and other countries. he had taken a lesson: this is the way you do it. you get elected, and then you start seizing more and more power. to the credit of the egyptian people, their story in recent years is the greatest peaceful uprising in the history of the world. it wasn't entirely peaceful because of the violence of the muslim brotherhood. they want a world caliphate, and they want to start with something resembling the old ottoman empire, that caliphate that came around north africa and on around the mediterranean, and they need egypt in order to make the beginning of the caliphate work. and so they were quite happy when radical islam, muslim brotherhood, took over egypt through morsi. but when the egyptian people, a third of the population, basically--30 million or so of the 90 million there in the nation of egypt--rose up together, yes, you had muslims marching with christians. [[page h1917]] the coptic christian pope himself has told me more than once how moving it was to have muslims and christians and jews and secularists walking together through the streets in egypt demanding an end to radical islamic control, demanding that the president, who was constantly violating the constitution, be removed. the coptic pope told me that it was moving when muslims, who just wanted peace in egypt--they didn't want radical islamic control--would come up to him and apologize for the way that morsi and the muslim brotherhood and radical islamists were acting. and, yes, among muslims, they are able to recognize that there is a part of islam--the radical islamists--that they don't like, but it is a part of islam. when the administration in this country tells the world that there is no such thing as radical islam, then they are demeaning and degrading those courageous muslims who stand up and say: we need to stop radical islam within muslims, within the islamic movement. they actually do damage to the people who want to live in peace. so we are grateful to the people of egypt for stopping the caliphate before it could be really set in concrete around north africa and, of course, syria, all the way around. they want to get back to the old ottoman empire and spread and cover the world under the caliphate. it is really most interesting. we have a president who went to elementary school in muslim school and was trained in islam in elementary school, and that is the main part of his training on islam. because, as we know, he sat under jeremiah wright's teaching in church for 20 years or so. so the basic teaching on islam was in elementary school, whereas there is the ultimate world expert on what is or is not islam that most of the world recognizes. they don't down the street here, down pennsylvania avenue. they don't at the state department under secretary kerry. but most of the world recognizes that a man who got degrees, including his doctor of philosophy, his ph.d., in islamic studies from the university of baghdad, is an expert on islam. he says radical islam is islam. he didn't just get a little elementary school training on islam. he studied islam his whole life, has a ph.d. in islamic studies, and has continued to pour himself into study of the koran, and he happens to be the head of the islamic state. {time} 1215 it would seem that if somebody who spent his life studying--rather than just studying islam in elementary school--says the islamic state is truly islam, perhaps the so-called experts in our state department and our white house ought to listen to that and take notice as well that perhaps maybe it is not as they have been saying, that it is not islam. it is islam, but it is a part of islam, the radical islamists, and we should be standing against it. so, again, the iran treaty clearly is a treaty. it needs to be called for what it is: a treaty. and we need to have people in the senate with courage to step up and say we need a vote on the iran treaty, because it is a treaty. the corker bill doesn't apply because it is a treaty. take the vote. two-thirds will not vote for it. it will not be confirmed. then we can call the iran treaty at an end, because it never was properly agreed to. but in the meantime, since this administration put so much of what credibility it has on the table and at risk by backing the iran deal, iran--it may be the run-in leaders, their radical islamic leaders, want to take over the world. they may be crazy in that regard, they may be power crazy in that regard, but they are very intelligent. you can be crazy and still be highly intelligent. that is how you can be crazy enough to fly a plane into a building and kill thousands of innocent people, but you are intelligent enough to have your engineers look at the plans and figure out what kind of load it would take to bring down a building like the world trade center. an article by joel pollak from last year--this is last year--and he says: ``in his state of the union address'' last year, ``president barack obama claimed: `our diplomacy is at work with respect to iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed iran; secures america and our allies, including israel; while avoiding yet another middle east conflict.' '' mr. pollak's article says: ``none of that is true. the chances of an agreement have dropped sharply, and even the most optimistic analysts do not expect a deal that `prevents a nuclear-armed iran,' but only one that puts nuclear `breakout' out of reach for a while. most important of all, we have not `halted the progress' of iran's nuclear program. earlier this month, the tehran regime announced that it was building two new reactors, and is thought to be behind a suspected facility planned in syria as well. ``in a lengthy essay in commentary magazine, the invaluable omri ceren summarizes the history of president obama's appeasement of the iranian's, from the first failed `suckers deal,' as the french called it, through the new veto threats against congressional sanctions. ``the scale of the obama administration's incompetence is simply daunting. far from rallying international unity against iran, president obama has destroyed it by giving away global demands decades in the making. ``suddenly, the reason for . . . invitation to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to congress--without consultation from the white house--becomes clear . . . it is not the pro-israel nature of congress that drove the bibi''--netanyahu--``invitation. it is the fact that obama''-- well, it says he misrepresented things, but that is this article. but it goes on to point out that ``there at least five ways in which iran has explicitly violated the interim agreement'' and spells those out. this is over a year old. they have never stopped violating the agreement--not the interim agreement--they were violating it, the executive agreement that this president entered with iran. they so much sank their reputation into the iran treaty that has not been ratified that these constant violations by iran have the administration defending iran, sending them money, covering for iran, making excuses for iran. this article was from less than a year ago by cory bennett from the hill: ``a diplomatic deal with iran to limit its nuclear program could inadvertently jumpstart the country's cyber warfare efforts. ``experts say tehran might use the economic sanctions relief from the nuclear pact to buttress its growing cyber program, which has already infiltrated critical networks in over a dozen countries, including the u.s.'' so the article goes on to point out: ``we are in a lose-lose situation.'' it is clear to most of us that the iranian agreement was a huge mistake. they are the largest state supporters of terrorism in the world, and this administration is ongoing right now in giving billions and billions of dollars. and though the iranian leaders have lied about so many things, when they say that the money that president obama gives to them, which they don't currently have--the $100 billion to $150 billion in the first year, perhaps $100 billion or so each year after that; it remains to be seen--their iranian leaders say: we are going to be able to fund more terrorist organizations. that is a statement we should take seriously. that is something that we should believe when they tell us these things. so the president is giving them the money. this article says this week that, of the $3 billion that was recently provided to iran, this administration can't really tell if they have used it to support additional terrorism or not. but this article that was written in may of last year that the iran deal could help fund iran's cyber war, i bring that up now--it is from may 10 of last year from mr. bennett--because it was just in the last 4 or 5 months that john hayward wrote the article: ``iran hacks state department social media accounts.'' we know they have hacked a new york dam web site. they have explored defenses of the united states government's internet. [[page h1918]] mr. speaker, it is interesting to look back and see that, wow, in may of last year, there were reporters that were warning that this deal with iran may help them in their cyber warfare against us greater than we even know. then we find out that this administration put a hold on charges against the iranians that hacked into our government system until after the deal was made so that people didn't raise more of a fuss to try to stop the iranian treaty. well, it is still not too late. the senate could go ahead and take a vote. we know that harry reid had said: gee, there are some low-level confirmations that are so important to the country, we are going to set aside the cloture rule. it only takes 51 votes to do that. mr. speaker, i would submit that this iranian treaty--i keep saying it because it is so critical to the world and to any chance at a semblance of world peace--has to be stopped because it is enriching the largest supporter of terrorism in the world. the iranian leaders have made clear to the iranian people that they have no intention of being bound by any agreement with president obama, john kerry, or the people here in the u.s. they are still going to do what they want to. so all the senate has to do is take a vote--51 votes; there are plenty of republicans to do that--and they might just get some democrats that are too afraid to be seen as supportive of iran and this nuclear deal that they may get some democrat votes. vote with 51 votes to set aside the cloture rule so you can bring treaty to the floor, have a vote on confirmation--it won't get the two-thirds--and then you would have all kinds of people that should have standing to go into federal court and put a stop to the billions of dollars that this administration is releasing illegally to iran. that is, funding--this administration says they know not what--it could be terrorism, they are not sure. i would submit they would--iran would be supporting terrorism. but here are five things that the article pointed out that they were--even a year ago--breaking the interim agreement: ``trying to buy equipment for plutonium reactor at arak, breaking commitment to suspend work. the obama administration actually complained about the purchases to the u.n. security council, even as it told the world that iran had `lived up to its end of the bargain.' '' they are ``feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into a plant where it had agreed to suspend nuclear enrichment. the institute for science and international security noted that iran had begun enrichment at the pilot fuel enrichment plant at natanz. it notified the obama administration, which complained to the iranians, which then claimed to have stop the enrichment activity.'' three: ``withholding camera footage of nuclear facilities, defying the international atomic energy agency. a leading international atomic energy agency official recently said the agency was `not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in iran' . . . the interim deal was to provide surveillance footage of iranian nuclear facilities, but iran has only provided would what it wants to reveal.'' and that is consistent with what steve king and i and a couple of other members were told by the iaea inspectors who were in charge of inspecting iran, that they can only go by what they are given. they are not given access to military facilities. they are not being given this footage. i am very proud to yield to my dear friend from kentucky (mr. massie), a proud graduate of mit on the floor. mr. massie. i thank the gentleman from texas for yielding to me. this is a very interesting topic that you are speaking on, and i have never had the chance on the floor to explain my feelings on this vote nor the reason why i voted as i did on the iran bill. so i appreciate the opportunity to say a little bit about this. mr. speaker, it is my understanding that the gentleman from texas is basically qualifying the iran deal as a treaty, and i agree with that position. in fact, i believe i was the only congressman to vote ``present'' on that bill. and the reason that i did vote ``present''--i just wanted a chance to clarify this--is that i felt that it was a treaty. i know a lot of us felt that way and we had different ways of dealing with that vote, but i voted ``present'' to indicate it was a treaty and that it really shouldn't have even been here in the house of representatives. {time} 1230 according to the constitution, only the senate shall agree to the treaties, and not the house. we shouldn't really have a say in that. so i just wanted the opportunity, and i appreciate the gentleman from texas giving me this opportunity, to explain the reason that i voted ``present.'' i think it was only the second time since i have been in congress, and it was for a constitutional reason. i felt strongly that was a treaty. i thank the gentleman from texas for this opportunity. mr. gohmert. if the gentleman would hang on for a moment, i voted for the bill, but i did not feel like it adequately dealt with the issue that my friend from kentucky raised, but i completely respect that position. since the gentleman from kentucky and i have had a lot of discussions about iran and the iranian treaty and his feelings, i have always felt that his vote, ``present,'' made eminent sense, was consistent with our position. really, the vote on what we took didn't really matter so much as the point that the gentleman has just made. this is a treaty. the senate needs to vote on it. our vote, though nice, was not particularly relevant to the fact that it is a treaty. i would like to ask, if the gentleman would yield for a question, because i saw that there was a handsome young man in a blue shirt that came in with him, and wondered if he might identify who has accompanied him onto the floor. mr. massie. as the gentleman from texas knows, we are allowed to bring younger constituents and visitors, and we have a visitor from kentucky; that is true. his name is joe. mr. gohmert. i thought perhaps he might be from kentucky. mr. massie. his name is joe. mr. gohmert. that is wonderful. he looks quite comfortable here on the floor, looks like he would be a good fit some day. i thank my friend for making that point. the vote that we took last year pointed out that the iranians had not complied; the administration had not complied, as i recall, with the requirements to provide proper information. but the gentleman from kentucky is exactly right. the real issue was a vote in the senate on it being a treaty. the senate has not yet voted on the iranian treaty as a treaty, and if they would do that, when it didn't get the two-thirds votes, then we could stop the outrage of sending billions of dollars to a country that has a massive amount of american, precious american blood on its hands because of the way in which they have funded terrorism. they were the largest provider of ieds when americans were fighting for muslim freedom in iraq, and yet iran continued to build and furnish ieds. it needs to be dealt with. people are suffering in the world. mr. speaker, i mentioned egypt, and what a great day for world history when a third of the population rose up, 30 million people that had never risen up in the history of the world, in peaceful demonstration, despite the muslim brotherhood's violence to try to make it appear otherwise. they had never risen up like those people did in egypt. they are to be commended. i would humbly submit that if this administration would help egypt and be the friend to egypt that it is being in helping iran and providing money to iran, then the world would be a far better place than it is with all the help that this administration is providing to iran. there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the ultimate result of the clinton, wendy sherman deal with north korea, in which, in essence, the clinton administration says: hey, we will give you nuclear--we will let you have nuclear power. we will give you what you need to have if you will just sign and say you won't ever use it to develop nukes. and then, big shocker for some in the democratic administration--it wasn't [[page h1919]] to most of us that were watching from afar in different places in the united states--north korea lied. they did use what we provided to create nuclear weapons, and now the world is a much less safe place. so i have no doubt that someday, maybe, some iranian will kill me; but somebody will be here on the floor, if the capitol still exists, and will point out that this deal that obama and kerry and wendy sherman did with iran, in allowing them to move forward with nuclear activity, providing them with $100 billion or so to start off, hundreds of billions in the future, that they ended up lying when they said they agreed, initially, to the agreement--even though they have said publicly: we are not going to abide by it--that they ended up using results from the obama administration's treaty to develop nuclear weapons, and that, just like the clinton-albright-sherman deal with north korea, the obama-kerry-sherman deal with iran has resulted in iran having nukes sooner than they would have otherwise, despite the promises previously by the obama administration to prevent iran from having nukes. actually, they helped them get the nukes. north carolina's passage of house bill 2 mr. gohmert. i want to turn to one other subject that has been very controversial--north carolina has gotten a bad rap--and this article from abc news, ``north carolina's controversial `anti-lgbt' bill explained.'' the article says: ``several civil rights groups and lgbtq advocates are organizing a rally tonight in raleigh''--this is from march 24 of this year--``north carolina, to protest the state's controversial passage of its house bill 2, which critics have called `the most anti- lgbt bill in the country.' '' the article says: ``here's everything you need to know about the bill, also known as the public facilities privacy and security act, which was signed into law by governor pat mccrory on wednesday. ``what does it do? ``house bill 2 declares that state law overrides all local ordinances concerning wages, employment, and public accommodations.'' ``thus, the law now bars local municipalities from creating their own rules prohibiting discrimination in public places based on sexual orientation and gender identity. though north carolina does have a statewide nondiscrimination law, it does not include specific protections for lgbtq people.'' we keep adding letters, you know. we kept adding letters until we got to lgbt, and now we have added q. ``the law also directs all public schools, government agencies, and public college campuses to require that multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities, such as locker rooms, be designated for use only by people based on their `biological sex' stated on their birth certificate. transgender people can use the bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their gender identity only if they get the biological sex on their birth certificate changed.'' ``under the law, public institutions can still offer single-occupancy facilities.'' and nobody has a problem with that. if you have got a single bathroom facility that has just got one facility for going to the bathroom, that is fine. it can be for whoever needs to use it. but they are saying, as has been consistent with the history of the world for most of the world's existence, that if you, according to documentation, are a female, you use the female restroom when it is for multiple people's use at the same time; and if, by documentation, you are a male, you use the male facilities. it has really been shocking to see how many people, including singers and entertainers and different groups--i understand target now wants to make sure that boys can use girls restrooms as they please. but it has been amazing that such people have been demanding that we have to let boys who want to go in little girls bathrooms go in there. if a man wants to go in a little girls bathroom, according to the big popular movement now, for heaven's sake, let's let the man go in the little girls bathroom. north carolina has taken action consistent with the position of the world since the world began. if you are going to have a multiple-use restroom, normally, you have a female go to a female multiuse restroom, a male go to a male multiuse restroom. this article goes on. it says: ``republican lawmakers, who make up the majority of north carolina's general assembly, publicly unveiled the language of the bill wednesday morning.'' it goes on and talks about its passage: ``in less than 12 hours''--i am talking about after its passage--``the bill was approved by the house and senate''--or after it was brought forward, the bill was passed, signed by the governor. lawmakers in the house voted 83-25 to pass the bill. the senate approved the bill, 32-0 after democrats, who make up the minority, walked out of the chamber in protest. obviously, they want men to go to little girls restrooms, too. ``republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from `radical' action by charlotte.'' ``critics of charlotte's ordinance said it could have allowed men who may be sexual offenders to enter a woman's restroom or locker room by claiming a transgender identity.'' well, critics of the charlotte ordinance is what the article says, but actually, that is not just a claim; that is a fact. under what north carolina was objecting to, if someone who is a sexual offender has decided he wants to go in and meddle in a little girls restroom where he has no business, people like the entertainer that doesn't want to go to north carolina, they are saying, by golly, you have got to let that man go in that little girls restroom. what has happened to the sense that used to be such a prominent part of this country? i mean, there was a very intelligent man on fox news, bill o'reilly, who actually asked a lawyer on a panel with him on the show: so they passed this law. they don't want men going into the women's restroom, basically, was the crux of it, or boys going in where little girls go. he asked the question, actually: who are they trying to protect? i couldn't believe that we have come to the point where an intelligent person would have to ask such a stupid question. whether you agree or disagree with what north carolina did, whom they were trying to protect, it is almost rhetorical. clearly, whether you agree or disagree, they were trying to protect the little girls. {time} 1245 it is shocking that anybody would have to ask such a question: gee, whom are they trying to protect by saying men can't go into girls' restrooms? incredible. the outrage aimed at north carolina has just been incredible. i see an article today by ryan lovelace from the washington examiner: trump slams north carolina bathroom law, says state should ``leave it the way it is.'' the way, apparently, charlotte was going to have it was that men could go in little girls' restrooms. of course, sexual predators who are male, all they have to do is say they are transgender and they get to go in the little girls' restrooms and wreak the havoc that made them a sexual predator. whom are they trying to protect in north carolina? they are trying to protect innocent kids who cannot protect themselves. they count on adults to keep them from harm. it is incredible that people are outraged at north carolina. anyone who has children who are female, do you really want men to say: i am transgender and get to go in where your little girl is going to the bathroom, where you can't go because you are not transgender? you are the girl's father. this article says ``what do proponents of the bill argue?'' it says: ``republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from `radical' action by charlotte.'' ``john rustin, president of the north carolina family policy council, testified before the senate, saying that the charlotte ordinance `means men could enter women restrooms and locker rooms--placing the privacy, safety, and [[page h1920]] dignity of women and the elderly at great risk.' '' parenthetically, i noticed an article in recent days, last week, that indicated that one of the leading colleges in pushing for transgender restrooms has had a problem--and it has come up a couple of times-- where men would come in where women were showering, go into the restroom and use their cell phone, hold it up over the stall so they can film or take pictures of the female who was trying to have some privacy in a very personal act of showering or going to the bathroom. what is wrong with saying: do you know what? when it comes to going to the restroom, females will go to female, males will go to male, and, look, if you want to have a single facility for one person at a time to use or families to use to change diapers or whatever, those are really handy? those are very helpful. my wife and i have used them ourselves raising girls. it is a handy thing to have. but why condemn north carolina when they are just trying to protect the privacy of girls? it has already been shown that, if you give guys a chance to say: i am transgender, and i can get to go in and film a girl in a shower, there will be people that do that. why not let the transgender lgbtqrst--whatever the initials are--let them have their activities where they don't impose upon the privacy of someone who wants to go to the restroom or shower without someone from the opposite sex being there with them? governor mccrory wrote this statement: ``the basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings, a restroom or locker room, for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of charlotte . . . as a result, i have signed legislation passed by a bipartisan majority to stop this breach of basic privacy and etiquette which was to go into effect april 1.'' mr. speaker, i mentioned that i understand target may now be changing their restrooms. i will have to double-check because, if they are going to be having women come to men's restrooms, i won't be going to target to shop unless and until that changes. usually, target is great. they have the restroom right there where you go in the door to the store, normally. you don't have to go clear to the back of the store. it is a handy thing. if you have to go shopping, it is handy, but not anymore. anybody that wants to go to the restroom and have privacy from the opposite sex may need to shop elsewhere. we will have to look at what they have actually done. anyway, this article seems to make the point that it is not such a crazy thing that north carolina has done, and that is why for 99.999 percent of human history, since civilization exists since we got past the caveman era, when there have been public restrooms, you recognize there is a difference between males and females. some day it will be written in the ``rise and fall of the united states'' that the greatest, freest, and most powerful country in the history of the world showed symptoms of insanity when it reached the pinnacle of its greatness and success--and this will be one of the symptoms that was written about--that they thought they were so much smarter than civilization for most of our history of the world that a difference was recognized between men and women for purposes of facilities. it is a sad day for the country. now, i see this article from yesterday that curt schilling, an espn analyst, was fired over what they deemed as an offensive social media post. here is what schilling said: the post showed an overweight man wearing a wig and women's clothing with parts of the t-shirt cut out to expose his chest. it says, ``let him into the restroom with your daughter or else you are a narrow-minded, judgmental, unloving racist bigot who needs to die.'' apparently, this kind of thing offends espn. although at one time their job was covering sports, now their job is being social managers, apparently, in making sure that, if men want to go to little girls' restrooms, then we let the men go to little girls' restrooms. this article from yesterday talking about target stores says: ``target says transgender customers may use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify.'' how about that. et tu, target? so here we are at the place in our history where insanity in the name of political correctness rules the day, common sense is no longer common, and to the point that the current leader in the republican campaign for president even says that north carolina should not have taken action that, in essence, says men--which would include sexual predators--should not be allowed to go in women's restrooms. he wanted it left like it was. so if charlotte wants to say that, if you are a man and you are a sexual predator and you say you are transgender and want to go into the restroom where little girls are, go ahead. that is the position of the leading republican candidate? i don't know. hopefully, that will be another one of the positions he will change. but, in the meantime, we need to get common sense back in charge in america while we are still the great country we have been. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore (mr. newhouse). members are reminded not to make reference to guests on the floor of the house. ____________________",31817

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgS2351-4,CREC-2016-04-21,114,WELCOMING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2351] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WELCOMING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to welcome Bishop Swain to the U.S. Senate. On behalf of myself, my colleague from South Dakota who is currently presiding over the Senate, and thousands of grateful believers in South Dakota, I thank Bishop Swain for his service to our Lord and to our communities of faith. Bishop Swain was sworn in as the eighth bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sioux Falls in late 2006, but his journey of faith and service to his country began far before that. Paul Joseph Swain was born in Newark, NY, and is one of eight children. After graduating from Northern Ohio University with a degree in history and earning his master's at the University of Wisconsin, Bishop Swain joined the Air Force as an intelligence officer. He served our Nation in the Vietnam war, where he earned a Bronze Star. Bishop Swain should feel right at home on the floor of the U.S. Senate because after serving in Vietnam, he tried his hand in politics. He completed his law degree and went on to work on the campaign and in the administration of Gov. Lee Sherman Dreyfus, who served as the Governor of Wisconsin until 1983. After a short stint in politics, Bishop Swain answered a much higher calling. He was received into the Catholic Church, graduated divinity school in 1988, and entered the priesthood. Years of dedicated pastoral work ensued in the Diocese of Madison, WI, and a decade ago we were truly blessed when Pope Benedict named him bishop of Sioux Falls. On the day of his ordination, Archbishop Flynn gave the homily at high mass. He noticed that as successors to the apostles, the service of bishops is to spread the word of God and promote the sanctity of their flock. Bishop Swain has never forgotten that counsel. He understands that the church has a role to play in the public square, particularly on moral issues. He never shies away from the challenges facing the poor and disenfranchised, and he never hesitates to stand for values that protect life and family. He is a pillar of our community and a spiritual leader to over 100,000 Catholics in East River, SD. Bishop Swain's episcopal motto is to ``Give praise to the Lord.'' Today we are giving praise for Bishop Swain's unwavering devotion to the word of the Lord and to the service of His people. I thank the bishop for joining us today. Mr. President, I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2351] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WELCOMING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, on one final matter, I want to take a minute to say something about an amendment yesterday that would have defunded regional commissions such as the Appalachian Regional Commission, or ARC. While I did not support that effort, it did raise some important questions about the direction of ARC. I have been a long supporter of the Appalachian Regional Commission, the only government agency whose main purpose is to help poor and disadvantaged communities in the Appalachian region. However, I am deeply concerned that after 50 years, ARC's focus has become clouded. For instance, ARC's internal guidelines cap at 30 percent the amount of area development funds that can be used in the most impoverished areas of Appalachia. It seems utterly illogical to me that at a government agency, whose mission should be to alleviate poverty, 70 percent of the funds go to counties that are not among the poorest. What does ARC stand for if not to help the poorest areas of Appalachia? Is ARC a specialized agency with a coherent mission or is it just another Federal bureaucracy that simply allocates funds among 13 selected States regardless of the need? I hope the vote last night will serve as a wake-up call for management at the ARC--a wake-up call that it is time for the agency to reform itself and focus on the counties that most need assistance. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2352] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION Mr. McCONNELL.

The committee has held dozens of hearings so far and, later this morning, members will mark up 2 more of the 12 funding bills, adding to the two the committee has already reported out unanimously. We will continue floor consideration of one of those unanimously endorsed measures today: the energy security and water infrastructure funding bill. The legislation before us includes provisions that impact each of our States. It will support our waterway infrastructure, boost energy innovation, and promote American competitiveness. It will strengthen national security and support our nuclear security program. It will also reduce wasteful spending. I appreciate the leadership of Senators Alexander and Feinstein on this bill and recognize the hard work and research that have gone into it. I also appreciate the Appropriations chairman, Senator Cochran, for working with Senator Mikulski to move these appropriations bills through committee and to the floor. This is a responsible bipartisan bill. It invests in the future of American energy and waterways. It will keep our country safe. So let's continue working today to advance it. ____________________",package_114_168.csv,2001,2001,2070,"[congressional record volume 162, number 62 (thursday, april 21, 2016)] [senate] [page s2352] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] energy and water development appropriations bill mr. mcconnell. mr. president, let us continue that work today. the republican-led senate has made important strides to get the legislative process functioning again. we know the impact that can have on restoring the appropriations process. we also know cooperation is going to be important as we move forward. it was good to see our democratic colleagues yesterday, recently pledging cooperation in the appropriations process, writing that this ``is a win-win opportunity, and we should seize it together.'' i have been pleased to see the headway that has already been made by the appropriations committee. the committee has held dozens of hearings so far and, later this morning, members will mark up 2 more of the 12 funding bills, adding to the two the committee has already reported out unanimously. we will continue floor consideration of one of those unanimously endorsed measures today: the energy security and water infrastructure funding bill. the legislation before us includes provisions that impact each of our states. it will support our waterway infrastructure, boost energy innovation, and promote american competitiveness. it will strengthen national security and support our nuclear security program. it will also reduce wasteful spending. i appreciate the leadership of senators alexander and feinstein on this bill and recognize the hard work and research that have gone into it. i also appreciate the appropriations chairman, senator cochran, for working with senator mikulski to move these appropriations bills through committee and to the floor. this is a responsible bipartisan bill. it invests in the future of american energy and waterways. it will keep our country safe. so let's continue working today to advance it. ____________________",2001

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgS2352-5,CREC-2016-04-21,114,NOMINATION OF JESSICA ROSENWORCEL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2352-S2353] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NOMINATION OF JESSICA ROSENWORCEL Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is difficult for me to be here to talk about what I am going to talk about because I believe that the Senate operates only when there is trust among the Members of this body. A man whom I served with whom I have such great respect for, and that is former Republican Majority Leader Bob Dole, said: I knew that nothing else I did would matter very much if I ever forfeited the trust of my colleagues. As we all learn around here, if you don't keep your word, it doesn't make much difference what agenda you try to advance. The trust which Senator Dole spoke of has been broken. The Republican leader McConnell broke his word to me. In December of 2014, the Republican leader and the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune, came to me on the floor, asking if I would agree to confirming a Republican Commissioner to the Federal Communications Commission. That man's name is Michael O'Rielly, and he had worked for Jon Kyl and John Cornyn. Of course, Cornyn is still here and Kyl left. I have great respect for Jon Kyl, being from my neighboring State of Arizona. So I said that this is kind of an unusual request, since everyone knows that two leaders, when we have a Commission we are going to staff with our selections, he and I have a right to do that, and we always pair them--a Democrat, a Republican, and a Democrat and a Republican. We pair them together. So I said to my friend from South Dakota and my friend from Kentucky that doesn't sound like the right thing to do for me, but they talked a while longer, and my heart said do it, my head said don't. My heart won, and I relented, after having made an arrangement, an agreement with them that we would go ahead and do O'Rielly right then; that I would agree to do that provided that when the new Congress convened in less than a month, we would take care of the Democrat. Her name is Jessica Rosenworcel. That was our agreement. That is how we would pair one Republican with a Democrat, as is our custom. But--and I repeat--I said: I agree, we will go ahead and do him now. He didn't have a job, so I was told, and so he could do that. They promised me they would confirm Rosenworcel the next Congress. I wasn't there alone. I had my staff with me. So it is not me saying one thing. I don't think anyone denies the conversation. I didn't have to agree to this. I did it because the Republican leader said he would do his part and get her confirmed. I am sorry to report to the world, to the Senate, I was wrong. Over the last 16 months, the Republican leader has refused to fulfill his commitment. He hasn't kept his word. Republicans assumed control of the Senate in January 2015. I waited patiently for the Republican leader and Senator Thune to keep their word regarding Rosenworcel's nomination. To his credit--John Thune and I have served here a long time. I know him well. I worked against him once and was successful. I worked against him a second time and wasn't successful. He beat my dear friend Tom Daschle, but he is a fine man. He and I used the gym together in the House. To his credit, [[Page S2353]] Senator Thune did everything he could to fulfill the commitment. He was having pressure not to do anything, I am sure, but he called his committee together. He is the chairman of the Commerce Committee. He reported Rosenworcel out to the Senate floor. There his authority stops. He doesn't have any power to do any more. He did what he felt he was obligated to do, and I felt he was obligated to do. It is now Senator McConnell's problem, I guess. But a year went by. She still wasn't sent to the floor. That is when I talked to Senator Thune--the first of many times. He did what he said he would do and reported her out. A few months ago, in December of 2015, a year after we had made our agreement, I reminded Senator McConnell of his commitment to do what he said he would do to quickly advance the nomination. He told me that the Senate would confirm her when we returned in 2016. January 2016 passed with no action. Before we left for the President's Day recess, I spoke again with Senators McConnell and Thune about Rosenworcel's nomination. February passed with no movement. March passed. Here we are, 21 days into April, with no confirmation. I have waited. I have waited patiently for my friend to do the right thing. I have held off for months coming to the floor. What else would I do? What else could I do? I held off, hoping the Republican leader would deliver on the pledge that he gave to me. I spoke again with him yesterday on the telephone, urging him to move her forward. He said to me: We'll do it next year. Next year she is out of a job. Her term expires at the end of this year. Her career will basically be over because of my accepting my counterpart's word. I told the Republican leader and I told Senator Thune that I would not remain silent forever on this. I told both of them yesterday I was going to come to the floor. The Republican leader, I hope, was aware of the words of Bob Dole, which I talked about earlier in my remarks. Dole said: I knew that nothing else I did would matter very much if I ever forfeited the trust of my colleagues. As we all learn around here, if you don't keep your word, it doesn't make much difference what agenda you try to advance. That was Robert Dole. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. This is a commitment that was made to me about a year and a half ago. We have to keep our trust. This isn't an issue of my being offended. I have been offended. The Presiding Officer has been offended. We have all been offended. This isn't only personal with me, in taking the Republican leader's promise as a personal affront. It is not a personal affront to me. If it is, I will have to bear that. I think it is, but I can handle that. What I am concerned about is what it means for the Senate and what it means for a human being, a woman who works very hard every day, trying to do the right thing for a very important part of our country. I understand the Republican leader has a tough job. I know that. I had that job a lot longer than he has. Because of the dysfunction in his caucus, it is difficult, I am told and as we see, for him to get things done. But that is no excuse for someone not keeping their word. He could go into executive session. We would agree to that. He could file cloture. He could do this in many different ways. I still expect him to live up to his commitment and get Commissioner Rosenworcel confirmed. I don't want this to be a bad time for the Senate if it continues. It is a bad day for the Senate now because you have to keep your word. That is all we have around here. I see no one on the floor, and I will ask the Chair to announce what the Senate is going to do the rest of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2352-S2353] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NOMINATION OF JESSICA ROSENWORCEL Mr. REID.

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgS2353-3,CREC-2016-04-21,114,ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL AND WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2353-S2354] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL AND WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the bill that is on the floor. The very fact that we have this bill on the floor deserves some attention. We have an appropriations bill on the energy and water responsibilities of the Federal Government. I think this is the first time this bill has been on the Senate floor in 7 years. With the current majority, the Appropriations Committee is 1 month ahead of any time in recent history that bills have been marked up and brought to the floor. The majority leader set aside 12 weeks to do the work that for decades--in fact, for a couple of centuries--was the core work of what the Congress did. The Congress set the priorities of the country by having an open and free debate on how the Congress and the country would spend the money that was entrusted to the Congress--the long-ranging discussion of the power of the purse. You know, you don't have to be a great student of American history to say: Well, don't you men and women in the Congress have the power of the purse? Well, we do have it, according to the Constitution, but we have not had it in the practice of the last 6 or 7 years when the work of the Congress simply was not done in a way that people could see what was going on or that Members could freely weigh in. One of the things about the debate we are having on this Energy and Water bill is that any Member of the Senate can come to the floor and they can say: Don't spend this money at all. In this bill, spend the money here rather than there. They can say some combination of those two things, and then the Senate votes on that before we approve the final bill. I am pleased that we are debating this bill. That may actually be more important than the bill itself. But the bill itself is important as well. This bill provides the critical resources to support the safety and long-term viability of our waterway systems. One of the reasons we are so competitive internationally and so competitive in our own domestic economy is that we have had the ability to use the waterways of the country--particularly the internal as well as the external waterways-- in a way that makes us more competitive than we would be otherwise. Our inland waterways in particular are critical to economic growth. We are right on the edge of a time when world food demand doubles from the Presiding Officer's State, from my State. Agriculture, which is the biggest economic sector of the economy, is in a great position not only to meet those food needs in our country but to meet food needs worldwide. That position is dramatically enhanced if we have a transportation system that doesn't just include highways and doesn't just include railroads but also includes the waterways of the country. Another thing our two States have had in common--the Upper Missouri and the Lower Missouri--is the devastating challenges that flooding can present. This bill makes it possible for us to deal with flood control and navigation. Once again, this emphasizes that the Corps of Engineers can't just say these are the top two priorities of managing the Mississippi River Valley system, particularly the Missouri and Mississippi, but those really need to be apparent in their commitment to both flood control and navigation as things we want to do. I am pleased this bill prioritizes things like the bank stabilization and navigation project on the Mississippi River, the tributaries project that is central to our flood control efforts in our State. I am also glad the bill increases funding for small ports and harbors to serve as vital places for us to compete. You know, the inland ports are basically export ports. There is nothing wrong with buying things from other people, but it is better to sell things to other people. The inland ports serve a geographic area that is roughly twice as big as the coastal ports. That doesn't mean there is anything wrong with the coastal ports; it just means, let's get realistic about where we are [[Page S2354]] making investments that allow us to compete. If a coastal port effectively really supports an area, say, 300 miles inland from that coastal port, an inland port supports an area 300 miles in all directions. So this is an effective thing for us to do. Also, we need to ensure that we are looking at our port systems as a system, not just as one individual port. The old days of the Congress being able to say ``This is what you want to do in this port or this harbor'' are now being replaced by being sure the Corps of Engineers understands its responsibility to do this. Another agency that needs to understand its reasonable responsibility is the EPA. So once again I am on the floor for the third time in about as many months--and heaven knows how many times in the last several years--talking about this incredible overreach EPA is making when they want to decide they don't want to change the law that says navigable waters of the United States are under the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency--not a new concept in law at all. Navigable waters have seemed to be a Federal responsibility since the 1840s in law, in bills that have passed the Congress. So in the early 1970s, the Clean Water Act was passed, and the EPA was formed. The Clean Water Act said the EPA will have jurisdiction over navigable waters. But with this outrageous waters of the United States rule, the EPA wants to now define ``navigable waters'' as basically all the water in the country. They want to say it is any water that can run into any water that can run into any water. I don't know how many iterations of that there would be that can run into any water that eventually runs into navigable water. There is a case before the Supreme Court right now where the EPA is challenging a company in Minnesota based on navigable waters. The location they are challenging is 120 miles away, by no argument, from the nearest thing that anybody would truly consider a navigable water. The Farm Bureau in Missouri has a map that I have brought to the floor now a number of times--the Farm Bureau map of where the jurisdiction of the EPA would be under waters of the United States. This is anything that deals with water: a building permit, runoff from your driveway, resurfacing a parking lot, fertilizer on a farm field, drilling a hole for a utility pole. Anything that involves water, theoretically, under this rule, could come under the jurisdiction of the EPA. In my State, anything that would meet the EPA definition of what could be the definition of their new sense of waters of the United States covers 99.7 percent of the State. The Presiding Officer is a little further from this map. He may not be able to see the two dozen white dots on the map that would clearly still under the jurisdiction of the State of Missouri or under the jurisdiction of a county government or under the jurisdiction of a city. That would be three-tenths of 1 percent. Senator Hoeven, who has fought to not allow this rule to go forward, as I have since the day it was proposed, has once again proposed an amendment to this bill. We all get to vote on it. A majority of the Senate has shown its concern about this particular regulation, this outlandish regulation--enough that the Senate and the House have put a bill on the President's desk in the last few months that the President vetoed, which said: Don't go forward with this regulation. What this amendment says is: No money can be spent to go forward with this regulation. I certainly encourage my colleagues to once again step up, as they are already on the record as having been willing to do, to stop this regulation. This amendment--the way to stop this regulation is to say that no money can be spent to move forward with this regulation, which a majority of the Congress, Democrats and Republicans, organizations all over America, government at virtually every level, county governments, city governments, and State governments, have said they don't want. The Attorney Generals of about half of the States have a case before the Supreme Court. But none of that seems to get through to the all-knowing EPA on this issue. Today I urge my colleagues to once again step up and say: We want this stopped. One way to stop it is not to have any money available to move forward with this outlandish rule. I yield the floor.

The Senator from New York. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2353-S2354] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL AND WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES Mr. BLUNT.

In my State, anything that would meet the EPA definition of what could be the definition of their new sense of waters of the United States covers 99.7 percent of the State. The Presiding Officer is a little further from this map. He may not be able to see the two dozen white dots on the map that would clearly still under the jurisdiction of the State of Missouri or under the jurisdiction of a county government or under the jurisdiction of a city. That would be three-tenths of 1 percent. Senator Hoeven, who has fought to not allow this rule to go forward, as I have since the day it was proposed, has once again proposed an amendment to this bill. We all get to vote on it. A majority of the Senate has shown its concern about this particular regulation, this outlandish regulation--enough that the Senate and the House have put a bill on the President's desk in the last few months that the President vetoed, which said: Don't go forward with this regulation. What this amendment says is: No money can be spent to go forward with this regulation. I certainly encourage my colleagues to once again step up, as they are already on the record as having been willing to do, to stop this regulation. This amendment--the way to stop this regulation is to say that no money can be spent to move forward with this regulation, which a majority of the Congress, Democrats and Republicans, organizations all over America, government at virtually every level, county governments, city governments, and State governments, have said they don't want. The Attorney Generals of about half of the States have a case before the Supreme Court. But none of that seems to get through to the all-knowing EPA on this issue. Today I urge my colleagues to once again step up and say: We want this stopped. One way to stop it is not to have any money available to move forward with this outlandish rule. I yield the floor.

The Senator from New York. ____________________",package_114_168.csv,8686,8686,8755,"[congressional record volume 162, number 62 (thursday, april 21, 2016)] [senate] [pages s2353-s2354] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] energy and water appropriations bill and waters of the united states mr. blunt. mr. president, i rise today to discuss the bill that is on the floor. the very fact that we have this bill on the floor deserves some attention. we have an appropriations bill on the energy and water responsibilities of the federal government. i think this is the first time this bill has been on the senate floor in 7 years. with the current majority, the appropriations committee is 1 month ahead of any time in recent history that bills have been marked up and brought to the floor. the majority leader set aside 12 weeks to do the work that for decades--in fact, for a couple of centuries--was the core work of what the congress did. the congress set the priorities of the country by having an open and free debate on how the congress and the country would spend the money that was entrusted to the congress--the long-ranging discussion of the power of the purse. you know, you don't have to be a great student of american history to say: well, don't you men and women in the congress have the power of the purse? well, we do have it, according to the constitution, but we have not had it in the practice of the last 6 or 7 years when the work of the congress simply was not done in a way that people could see what was going on or that members could freely weigh in. one of the things about the debate we are having on this energy and water bill is that any member of the senate can come to the floor and they can say: don't spend this money at all. in this bill, spend the money here rather than there. they can say some combination of those two things, and then the senate votes on that before we approve the final bill. i am pleased that we are debating this bill. that may actually be more important than the bill itself. but the bill itself is important as well. this bill provides the critical resources to support the safety and long-term viability of our waterway systems. one of the reasons we are so competitive internationally and so competitive in our own domestic economy is that we have had the ability to use the waterways of the country--particularly the internal as well as the external waterways-- in a way that makes us more competitive than we would be otherwise. our inland waterways in particular are critical to economic growth. we are right on the edge of a time when world food demand doubles from the presiding officer's state, from my state. agriculture, which is the biggest economic sector of the economy, is in a great position not only to meet those food needs in our country but to meet food needs worldwide. that position is dramatically enhanced if we have a transportation system that doesn't just include highways and doesn't just include railroads but also includes the waterways of the country. another thing our two states have had in common--the upper missouri and the lower missouri--is the devastating challenges that flooding can present. this bill makes it possible for us to deal with flood control and navigation. once again, this emphasizes that the corps of engineers can't just say these are the top two priorities of managing the mississippi river valley system, particularly the missouri and mississippi, but those really need to be apparent in their commitment to both flood control and navigation as things we want to do. i am pleased this bill prioritizes things like the bank stabilization and navigation project on the mississippi river, the tributaries project that is central to our flood control efforts in our state. i am also glad the bill increases funding for small ports and harbors to serve as vital places for us to compete. you know, the inland ports are basically export ports. there is nothing wrong with buying things from other people, but it is better to sell things to other people. the inland ports serve a geographic area that is roughly twice as big as the coastal ports. that doesn't mean there is anything wrong with the coastal ports; it just means, let's get realistic about where we are [[page s2354]] making investments that allow us to compete. if a coastal port effectively really supports an area, say, 300 miles inland from that coastal port, an inland port supports an area 300 miles in all directions. so this is an effective thing for us to do. also, we need to ensure that we are looking at our port systems as a system, not just as one individual port. the old days of the congress being able to say ``this is what you want to do in this port or this harbor'' are now being replaced by being sure the corps of engineers understands its responsibility to do this. another agency that needs to understand its reasonable responsibility is the epa. so once again i am on the floor for the third time in about as many months--and heaven knows how many times in the last several years--talking about this incredible overreach epa is making when they want to decide they don't want to change the law that says navigable waters of the united states are under the authority of the environmental protection agency--not a new concept in law at all. navigable waters have seemed to be a federal responsibility since the 1840s in law, in bills that have passed the congress. so in the early 1970s, the clean water act was passed, and the epa was formed. the clean water act said the epa will have jurisdiction over navigable waters. but with this outrageous waters of the united states rule, the epa wants to now define ``navigable waters'' as basically all the water in the country. they want to say it is any water that can run into any water that can run into any water. i don't know how many iterations of that there would be that can run into any water that eventually runs into navigable water. there is a case before the supreme court right now where the epa is challenging a company in minnesota based on navigable waters. the location they are challenging is 120 miles away, by no argument, from the nearest thing that anybody would truly consider a navigable water. the farm bureau in missouri has a map that i have brought to the floor now a number of times--the farm bureau map of where the jurisdiction of the epa would be under waters of the united states. this is anything that deals with water: a building permit, runoff from your driveway, resurfacing a parking lot, fertilizer on a farm field, drilling a hole for a utility pole. anything that involves water, theoretically, under this rule, could come under the jurisdiction of the epa. in my state, anything that would meet the epa definition of what could be the definition of their new sense of waters of the united states covers 99.7 percent of the state. the presiding officer is a little further from this map. he may not be able to see the two dozen white dots on the map that would clearly still under the jurisdiction of the state of missouri or under the jurisdiction of a county government or under the jurisdiction of a city. that would be three-tenths of 1 percent. senator hoeven, who has fought to not allow this rule to go forward, as i have since the day it was proposed, has once again proposed an amendment to this bill. we all get to vote on it. a majority of the senate has shown its concern about this particular regulation, this outlandish regulation--enough that the senate and the house have put a bill on the president's desk in the last few months that the president vetoed, which said: don't go forward with this regulation. what this amendment says is: no money can be spent to go forward with this regulation. i certainly encourage my colleagues to once again step up, as they are already on the record as having been willing to do, to stop this regulation. this amendment--the way to stop this regulation is to say that no money can be spent to move forward with this regulation, which a majority of the congress, democrats and republicans, organizations all over america, government at virtually every level, county governments, city governments, and state governments, have said they don't want. the attorney generals of about half of the states have a case before the supreme court. but none of that seems to get through to the all-knowing epa on this issue. today i urge my colleagues to once again step up and say: we want this stopped. one way to stop it is not to have any money available to move forward with this outlandish rule. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from new york. ____________________",8686

Mr. President, April is actually Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and I rise to speak about two extraordinary women who were accepted into their dream colleges and then after they arrived on campus were sexually assaulted. They tried to seek help from their school, and they were blamed for their assaults by their school's administrators. A couple of years ago, these two young women walked into my office. They didn't have an appointment. They didn't have any connections on Capitol Hill. They certainly didn't have an expensive lobbyist to lead them in. Annie and Andrea had heard about my work to fight sexual assaults in the military, and they simply wanted to help. The same crisis was unfolding on college campuses across the country. When they tried to report their rapes, they were not believed. They were actually retaliated against. For them, justice seemed impossible. But instead of doing nothing, Annie and Andrea joined together and they created an organization called End Rape on Campus. They took their stories to college campus after college campus to be heard, to help other survivors like themselves, to make a difference, to achieve justice, and to hold these schools accountable. Together, Annie and Andrea have helped many other sexual assault survivors file dozens of title IX complaints for how their schools mishandled their sexual assault claims. These young women are changing lives. They are helping their peers find justice. They took a risk to raise their voices, and now we are closer than ever to passing a comprehensive, bipartisan piece of legislation to make sure campus sexual assault cases are handled with the professionalism and fairness all our students deserve. We are closer than ever to passing a bill that would finally give our colleges and universities an incentive to solve the problem of sexual assault rather than stay silent and pretend it doesn't exist because they are worried about application numbers or press releases. I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to support this bipartisan bill, the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, because when surveys keep confirming that one out of five of our women in college are sexually assaulted before they graduate, we know we have more work to do. We need to follow the example of Annie and Andrea and speak out about this crisis. I am going to use this moment to tell one story--the story of Andrea, what actually happened to her. She wrote a book with Annie called ``We Believe You.'' It is an incredible compilation of survivor stories. It is quite heartbreaking and very tough to read, but it is one of the most inspiring books I have ever read. There are thousands of stories just like hers. I have others to tell on the Senate floor, but now I am going to tell you Andrea's in her own words: After I publicly came forward as a survivor, I learned that the biggest triggers aren't actually the nightmares of my assault, but the nightmares of the betrayals that I've had to survive. When the media tells your story, it feels like open season on your truth. It's exposed to commentary, and a part of you loses control over it, and the vulnerabilities that you intended to share. When you tell your story to the media, you're at the mercy of their portrayal, and the portrayal of others. I've been betrayed by friends who struggled to understand what happened to me, and to accept that the same person who put forth strength and composure could fall apart. I wish I could have said the right things to get them to understand that I was broken, and that my confidence was a lie to both of us. I've been betrayed by the university that I love so dearly, whose seal I wear around my neck, and whose quads and bricks hold pieces of me--pieces of who I was before, and of who I am today. Andrea is one of many young men and women whose lives have been shattered by a violent sexual crime and then shattered again by a second betrayal when their schools chose not to [[Page S2355]] believe them or to offer justice. These survivors deserve better. They need Congress to act. We have to do the right thing. We have to be their voice. We have to stand for them.

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgS2355-2,CREC-2016-04-21,114,FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2355-S2357] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I recently had the opportunity to convene a roundtable at the University of Baltimore School of Law entitled: ``Why Nine? A Discussion on the Importance of a Fully Functioning Supreme Court.'' I want to particularly thank the dean of the University of Baltimore Law School, Ronald Weich, for moderating this roundtable and bringing his extensive experience to this discussion. Ron Weich is well known here. He is the former chief counsel to Senate Minority Leader Reid and former Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs at the U.S. Justice Department. I want to share with my colleagues some of the comments that were made by the people who were at that roundtable discussion. Caroline Frederickson, the president of the American Constitution Society, discussed the lengthy delays for trial and appellate court decisions. Lengthy delays in filling vacancies mean that justice delayed is justice denied. We have seen a growing number of judicial emergencies as a result of the Senate leadership's slow-walking of the consideration of judicial nominations, as I discussed recently on the floor of the Senate. One of these is my own State of Maryland's district court vacancy, in which Paula Xinis has been waiting for floor action now since she was reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously in September of 2015. She has waited over 7 months for action on the floor of the Senate. Ms. Frederickson also noted the increasing number of 4-to-4 decisions being issued by the Supreme Court. She warned that a Court that is split on a tough 4-to-4 decision might be tempted to ``legislate'' a solution by asking the parties to reshape the legal questions before the Court and go beyond the narrow case or controversy that is properly before the Court. That is something all of us want to avoid. We don't want the Court legislating. John Greenbaum, chief counsel and senior deputy director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told the group that if Republicans hold to their pledge to block the filling of the Supreme Court vacancy until a new President takes office, this vacancy would span and negatively impact two terms of the Court and could last more than a year. [[Page S2356]] The Presidential election occurs in November of 2016, but the new President is not sworn into office until late January 2017. Allowing for several months, which is the standard time for consideration of a Supreme Court nominee, it could be next spring of 2017, more than a year after Justice Scalia's death before the vacancy is filled. Mr. Greenbaum noted that the Court issued a number of 5-to-4 decisions in the current term, many of which drew a wide range of amicus briefs from all sides on the issue, and that the Court was trying to resolve circuit splits in a number of these cases. It cannot resolve circuit splits with a 4-to-4 vote, leaving us with different laws in different parts of the country. Michele Jawando, vice president of legal progress at the Center for American Progress, discussed focusing the American people's attention on the third branch of government--the judiciary--which often does not receive the same level of focus as the executive and legislative branches. Professor Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, previously served as deputy general counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives and served as assistant legal counsel for the U.S. Senate. He formerly clerked on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the court that Chief Judge Garland currently sits. Professor Tiefer cited two interesting precedents we should keep in mind as the Senate considers--or, frankly, fails to consider--Chief Judge Garland's nomination. In 1988, the Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court, even though the Senate was controlled by a Democratic majority and President Reagan was in his final year of office--very similar to the circumstances we have today. In 1991, when Democrats controlled the Senate, they allowed the nomination of Clarence Thomas to reach the Senate floor even though the Judiciary Committee had not favorably recommended him. The Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Biden, believed the full Senate should debate a nomination for the Supreme Court of the United States and that each Senator should cast their vote either for or against the nomination. Ultimately, the Senate narrowly confirmed Justice Thomas by a 52-to-48 vote. Indeed, turning to Judge Garland, no nominee--and, really, no President--has ever been treated this way by the Senate. Since public confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominations began a century ago in the Judiciary Committee, the Senate has never denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. This would be the first. By refusing to follow this practice, the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate leadership are abrogating their constitutional duties. This is an affront to the Constitution. It is not a political assault. This is an assault on the Constitution. Turning to article II, the Executive power in the Constitution, the Senate Republican leadership is trying to unilaterally alter the term of the President from 4 years to 3 years and somehow argue that the President in his or her final year of office cannot do his or her job, which includes nominating Supreme Court Justices if a vacancy occurs. This flies in the face of the plain text of the Constitution. The Constitution commands that the President ``shall'' nominate Supreme Court Justices in the event of a vacancy. The Senate is failing to exercise its constitutional duty to advise and consent. Turning to article III, the judicial power of the Constitution, the Senate leadership is trying to unilaterally shrink the Supreme Court from nine justices to eight by creating an artificial vacancy for an indefinite period of time. Congress, by enacting a statute, has already set the size of the Supreme Court as consisting of nine justices. There is an odd number for a reason--to enable the Court to break tie votes. The Senate Republican leadership is pursuing a strategy that will hobble the Court for two terms. This results in an increasing number of circuit splits and a nonuniform application of Federal law across the country, with no resolution in sight, meaning that an individual's rights and responsibilities under Federal law would depend on what circuit they happen to live in or do business in. Article VI of the Constitution provides that ``the Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath of Affirmation, to support this Constitution.'' And I will say that what we are doing right now is abrogating that right. Professor Michael Higginbotham is the Dean Joseph Curtis Professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, and he was a former law clerk to a U.S. circuit judge. Professor Higginbotham agreed it is unprecedented for the Senate not even to consider or vote on a nomination for a Supreme Corporate Justice. He cited the famous case of Marbury v. Madison, decided by the Supreme Court in 1803. The case held that a constitutional right without a remedy is no right at all, and that a right must have a remedy. But what happens when the Supreme Court cannot issue a final decision on a complex or controversial case in the law? What is the remedy that follows that right? What happens when one branch of government refuses to do its job, endangering the operation of another equal and independent branch of government? A Supreme Court that divides by a vote of 4 to 4 in major decisions leads to uncertainty and lack of specificity in the law, due to splits in the various circuit courts of appeal around the Nation. Amy Matsui is the senior counsel and director of government relations at the National Women's Law Center. She reminded us that women's lives are affected every day by the decisions of the Supreme Court and lower Federal courts. Lawyers have an innate respect for the rule of law and legal process. If lawyers report to work and do their job every day, why can't the Senate? She asked a good question. Thiru Vignarajah is the Deputy Attorney General of Maryland, serving under the leadership of Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh. He discussed the importance of the judiciary being able to function independently and efficiently. Out of the thousands of petitions for certiorari, the Supreme Court grants about 1 percent of the cases, ultimately deciding about 150 cases a year. Dozens of these cases were 5-to-4 decisions of a divided Supreme Court. These are hard cases where reasonable jurists can disagree, and indeed a number of these cases have split circuit courts around the Nation, with judges issuing conflicting decisions on differing interpretations of Federal law. This uncertainty is bad for the marketplace, bad for business, bad for lawyers, bad for judges, bad for litigants, and ultimately bad for the American people. Quite frankly, in some cases, businesses would prefer any ruling because it at least gives certainty about what the law is. Businesses do not want Federal law to become a patchwork and vary from circuit to circuit and State to State because a divided Supreme Court cannot resolve the issue. Kyle Barry, the director of justice programs at the Alliance of Justice, discussed the importance of judicial independence. While the President has the power of the sword and controls government agencies and the Congress has the power of the purse and the ability to enact or change laws, the judiciary relies on the other branches of government and the American people to carry out its decisions. The Framers of our Constitution gave the Justices lifetime tenure because it insulates them from the political pressures under Article III, Section 1, of the Constitution, so that they would not have to worry about losing their job through congressional impeachment if they reached an unpopular decision. Note that these are the only lifetime positions in the Federal Government. The Framers forbade Congress from cutting the salaries of the Justices while in office under Article III, Section 1, of the Constitution, to avoid retribution from Congress for unpopular decisions of the Court. By undermining the independence of the Supreme Court and by making the Court appear to be a political entity, Republican Senate leadership is undermining the public's confidence in the Court and ultimately the very legitimacy of the Court. Our Framers intended with these very specific constitutional provisions to protect the Court and the Federal judiciary from politics. [[Page S2357]] The Senate should do its job and carry out its mission to fill vacancies of the Supreme Court, so that Americans will have confidence that the Supreme Court decides cases based on the law, Constitution, and facts of the case and so that politics does not play a role. The American public supports Congress doing its job and giving Judge Garland the hearing he deserves. The stakes at the Supreme Court can involve matters of life and death. In death penalty cases, if the Court splits 4 to 4, a defendant would be put to death even though the Court decision did not definitively resolve the legal issue in the case. Chief Judge Garland is a nominee for the Supreme Court and should be dealt with in this term of Congress. It is not a matter for the next President or the next Congress. There are 9 months left in this year, and to suggest that we don't have the time and the President doesn't have the authority to appoint a nominee is absolutely outrageous. It is an affront to the Constitution. We need to go through the process and give Chief Judge Garland a chance. I have met with Chief Judge Garland and believe he is eminently qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice. But before the Senate makes a final decision, we need to do our job and vet the nominee, hold a hearing, and hold a vote that puts all Senators on the record. How can Senators in good conscience reject this Supreme Court nominee without a fair vetting and hearing or process? I think it is hard to understand how you can be excused from doing your job for 9 months by not having a confirmation hearing and vote. The President did his job, and it is now time for the Senate to do its job. The American people want to see nine justices on the Supreme Court when it convenes its new term in October. The Senate now has the responsibility and duty to respect the independence of the Federal judiciary, the authority of the President to nominate Justices, and the powers of the Senate to advise and consent on nominations. Let's remember our oaths to support the Constitution. Let's do our job. Let's take up the Garland nomination. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2355-S2357] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I recently had the opportunity to convene a roundtable at the University of Baltimore School of Law entitled: ``Why Nine? A Discussion on the Importance of a Fully Functioning Supreme Court.'' I want to particularly thank the dean of the University of Baltimore Law School, Ronald Weich, for moderating this roundtable and bringing his extensive experience to this discussion. Ron Weich is well known here. He is the former chief counsel to Senate Minority Leader Reid and former Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs at the U.S. Justice Department. I want to share with my colleagues some of the comments that were made by the people who were at that roundtable discussion. Caroline Frederickson, the president of the American Constitution Society, discussed the lengthy delays for trial and appellate court decisions. Lengthy delays in filling vacancies mean that justice delayed is justice denied. We have seen a growing number of judicial emergencies as a result of the Senate leadership's slow-walking of the consideration of judicial nominations, as I discussed recently on the floor of the Senate. One of these is my own State of Maryland's district court vacancy, in which Paula Xinis has been waiting for floor action now since she was reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously in September of 2015. She has waited over 7 months for action on the floor of the Senate. Ms. Frederickson also noted the increasing number of 4-to-4 decisions being issued by the Supreme Court. She warned that a Court that is split on a tough 4-to-4 decision might be tempted to ``legislate'' a solution by asking the parties to reshape the legal questions before the Court and go beyond the narrow case or controversy that is properly before the Court. That is something all of us want to avoid. We don't want the Court legislating. John Greenbaum, chief counsel and senior deputy director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told the group that if Republicans hold to their pledge to block the filling of the Supreme Court vacancy until a new President takes office, this vacancy would span and negatively impact two terms of the Court and could last more than a year. [[Page S2356]] The Presidential election occurs in November of 2016, but the new President is not sworn into office until late January 2017. Allowing for several months, which is the standard time for consideration of a Supreme Court nominee, it could be next spring of 2017, more than a year after Justice Scalia's death before the vacancy is filled. Mr. Greenbaum noted that the Court issued a number of 5-to-4 decisions in the current term, many of which drew a wide range of amicus briefs from all sides on the issue, and that the Court was trying to resolve circuit splits in a number of these cases. It cannot resolve circuit splits with a 4-to-4 vote, leaving us with different laws in different parts of the country. Michele Jawando, vice president of legal progress at the Center for American Progress, discussed focusing the American people's attention on the third branch of government--the judiciary--which often does not receive the same level of focus as the executive and legislative branches. Professor Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, previously served as deputy general counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives and served as assistant legal counsel for the U.S. Senate. He formerly clerked on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the court that Chief Judge Garland currently sits. Professor Tiefer cited two interesting precedents we should keep in mind as the Senate considers--or, frankly, fails to consider--Chief Judge Garland's nomination. In 1988, the Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court, even though the Senate was controlled by a Democratic majority and President Reagan was in his final year of office--very similar to the circumstances we have today. In 1991, when Democrats controlled the Senate, they allowed the nomination of Clarence Thomas to reach the Senate floor even though the Judiciary Committee had not favorably recommended him. The Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Biden, believed the full Senate should debate a nomination for the Supreme Court of the United States and that each Senator should cast their vote either for or against the nomination. Ultimately, the Senate narrowly confirmed Justice Thomas by a 52-to-48 vote. Indeed, turning to Judge Garland, no nominee--and, really, no President--has ever been treated this way by the Senate. Since public confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominations began a century ago in the Judiciary Committee, the Senate has never denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. This would be the first. By refusing to follow this practice, the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate leadership are abrogating their constitutional duties. This is an affront to the Constitution. It is not a political assault. This is an assault on the Constitution. Turning to article II, the Executive power in the Constitution, the Senate Republican leadership is trying to unilaterally alter the term of the President from 4 years to 3 years and somehow argue that the President in his or her final year of office cannot do his or her job, which includes nominating Supreme Court Justices if a vacancy occurs. This flies in the face of the plain text of the Constitution. The Constitution commands that the President ``shall'' nominate Supreme Court Justices in the event of a vacancy. The Senate is failing to exercise its constitutional duty to advise and consent. Turning to article III, the judicial power of the Constitution, the Senate leadership is trying to unilaterally shrink the Supreme Court from nine justices to eight by creating an artificial vacancy for an indefinite period of time. Congress, by enacting a statute, has already set the size of the Supreme Court as consisting of nine justices. There is an odd number for a reason--to enable the Court to break tie votes. The Senate Republican leadership is pursuing a strategy that will hobble the Court for two terms.

cited two interesting precedents we should keep in mind as the senate considers--or, frankly, fails to consider--chief judge garland's nomination. in 1988, the senate confirmed justice kennedy to the supreme court, even though the senate was controlled by a democratic majority and president reagan was in his final year of office--very similar to the circumstances we have today. in 1991, when democrats controlled the senate, they allowed the nomination of clarence thomas to reach the senate floor even though the judiciary committee had not favorably recommended him. the judiciary committee, under chairman biden, believed the full senate should debate a nomination for the supreme court of the united states and that each senator should cast their vote either for or against the nomination. ultimately, the senate narrowly confirmed justice thomas by a 52-to-48 vote. indeed, turning to judge garland, no nominee--and, really, no president--has ever been treated this way by the senate. since public confirmation hearings of supreme court nominations began a century ago in the judiciary committee, the senate has never denied a supreme court nominee a hearing and a vote. this would be the first. by refusing to follow this practice, the senate judiciary committee and senate leadership are abrogating their constitutional duties. this is an affront to the constitution. it is not a political assault. this is an assault on the constitution. turning to article ii, the executive power in the constitution, the senate republican leadership is trying to unilaterally alter the term of the president from 4 years to 3 years and somehow argue that the president in his or her final year of office cannot do his or her job, which includes nominating supreme court justices if a vacancy occurs. this flies in the face of the plain text of the constitution. the constitution commands that the president ``shall'' nominate supreme court justices in the event of a vacancy. the senate is failing to exercise its constitutional duty to advise and consent. turning to article iii, the judicial power of the constitution, the senate leadership is trying to unilaterally shrink the supreme court from nine justices to eight by creating an artificial vacancy for an indefinite period of time. congress, by enacting a statute, has already set the size of the supreme court as consisting of nine justices. there is an odd number for a reason--to enable the court to break tie votes. the senate republican leadership is pursuing a strategy that will hobble the court for two terms. this results in an increasing number of circuit splits and a nonuniform application of federal law across the country, with no resolution in sight, meaning that an individual's rights and responsibilities under federal law would depend on what circuit they happen to live in or do business in. article vi of the constitution provides that ``the senators and representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the united states and of the several states, shall be bound by oath of affirmation, to support this constitution.'' and i will say that what we are doing right now is abrogating that right. professor michael higginbotham is the dean joseph curtis professor at the university of baltimore school of law, and he was a former law clerk to a u.s. circuit judge. professor higginbotham agreed it is unprecedented for the senate not even to consider or vote on a nomination for a supreme corporate justice. he cited the famous case of marbury v. madison, decided by the supreme court in 1803. the case held that a constitutional right without a remedy is no right at all, and that a right must have a remedy. but what happens when the supreme court cannot issue a final decision on a complex or controversial case in the law? what is the remedy that follows that right? what happens when one branch of government refuses to do its job, endangering the operation of another equal and independent branch of government? a supreme court that divides by a vote of 4 to 4 in major decisions leads to uncertainty and lack of specificity in the law, due to splits in the various circuit courts of appeal around the nation. amy matsui is the senior counsel and director of government relations at the national women's law center. she reminded us that women's lives are affected every day by the decisions of the supreme court and lower federal courts. lawyers have an innate respect for the rule of law and legal process. if lawyers report to work and do their job every day, why can't the senate? she asked a good question. thiru vignarajah is the deputy attorney general of maryland, serving under the leadership of maryland attorney general brian frosh. he discussed the importance of the judiciary being able to function independently and efficiently. out of the thousands of petitions for certiorari, the supreme court grants about 1 percent of the cases, ultimately deciding about 150 cases a year. dozens of these cases were 5-to-4 decisions of a divided supreme court. these are hard cases where reasonable jurists can disagree, and indeed a number of these cases have split circuit courts around the nation, with judges issuing conflicting decisions on differing interpretations of federal law. this uncertainty is bad for the marketplace, bad for business, bad for lawyers, bad for judges, bad for litigants, and ultimately bad for the american people. quite frankly, in some cases, businesses would prefer any ruling because it at least gives certainty about what the law is. businesses do not want federal law to become a patchwork and vary from circuit to circuit and state to state because a divided supreme court cannot resolve the issue. kyle barry, the director of justice programs at the alliance of justice, discussed the importance of judicial independence. while the president has the power of the sword and controls government agencies and the congress has the power of the purse and the ability to enact or change laws, the judiciary relies on the other branches of government and the american people to carry out its decisions. the framers of our constitution gave the justices lifetime tenure because it insulates them from the political pressures under article iii, section 1, of the constitution, so that they would not have to worry about losing their job through congressional impeachment if they reached an unpopular decision. note that these are the only lifetime positions in the federal government. the framers forbade congress from cutting the salaries of the justices while in office under article iii, section 1, of the constitution, to avoid retribution from congress for unpopular decisions of the court. by undermining the independence of the supreme court and by making the court appear to be a political entity, republican senate leadership is undermining the public's confidence in the court and ultimately the very legitimacy of the court. our framers intended with these very specific constitutional provisions to protect the court and the federal judiciary from politics. [[page s2357]] the senate should do its job and carry out its mission to fill vacancies of the supreme court, so that americans will have confidence that the supreme court decides cases based on the law, constitution, and facts of the case and so that politics does not play a role. the american public supports congress doing its job and giving judge garland the hearing he deserves. the stakes at the supreme court can involve matters of life and death. in death penalty cases, if the court splits 4 to 4, a defendant would be put to death even though the court decision did not definitively resolve the legal issue in the case. chief judge garland is a nominee for the supreme court and should be dealt with in this term of congress. it is not a matter for the next president or the next congress. there are 9 months left in this year, and to suggest that we don't have the time and the president doesn't have the authority to appoint a nominee is absolutely outrageous. it is an affront to the constitution. we need to go through the process and give chief judge garland a chance. i have met with chief judge garland and believe he is eminently qualified to be a supreme court justice. but before the senate makes a final decision, we need to do our job and vet the nominee, hold a hearing, and hold a vote that puts all senators on the record. how can senators in good conscience reject this supreme court nominee without a fair vetting and hearing or process? i think it is hard to understand how you can be excused from doing your job for 9 months by not having a confirmation hearing and vote. the president did his job, and it is now time for the senate to do its job. the american people want to see nine justices on the supreme court when it convenes its new term in october. the senate now has the responsibility and duty to respect the independence of the federal judiciary, the authority of the president to nominate justices, and the powers of the senate to advise and consent on nominations. let's remember our oaths to support the constitution. let's do our job. let's take up the garland nomination. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cardin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",13482
CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgS2355,CREC-2016-04-21,114,ATVM LOAN PROGRAM,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2355] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ATVM LOAN PROGRAM Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to address an amendment that has been filed, and on which I hope we are going to have a vote. That is amendment No. 3814. It is called End Crony Capitalist Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program. Let me describe what this is about. We are all watching this Presidential election campaign unfold, and a big theme on both sides of the aisle is about how the Obama economy is not working for so many millions of ordinary Americans--middle-income, middle-class, working- class Americans who are working as hard as ever and falling behind. It is true. It has absolutely been a fact that this economy is not anywhere near where it should be. Part of that and part of the theme is how Washington works for the well-connected--for the few who get to figure out how to get special benefits from taxpayers. But that doesn't apply if you are an ordinary man or woman who is just working hard to feed their family and take care of their family and who doesn't have the lobbyists and the connections to get special treatment. It is infuriating for people, and they are right. One of the most egregious examples is the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program. This is a program that forces taxpayers to lend money to especially preferred--very affluent, generally--and well- connected businesses. It was created in 2007, and it requires the Department of Energy to lend this money--up to $25 billion of taxpayer money--to private corporations that ought to be funding their activity privately. Why should my constituents in Pennsylvania be made to take the risk for some company that has an idea they want to float? Why in the world should it be that my constituents and your constituents, Mr. President, have to subsidize a particular business because some politicians decide they like it? This is completely outrageous, and this program is particularly egregious. So far this program has made five loans worth $8.4 billion. Of the five, two of them have already defaulted. Two have already gone under. Why should our taxpayers have to make these loans to companies that then fail, and the taxpayers end up holding the bag? Fisker Automotive is one of them. They got a $529 million loan in 2010. It took less than 1 year for them to default. The Department of Energy--which is to say, our constituents, taxpayers--then took a $139 million loss, just on that one transaction. The Vehicle Production Group got a $50 million loan in 2011. Two years later, they defaulted. Taxpayers lost almost all of it--$42 million. But it gets even more absurd. In 2011, the Department of Energy, under this program, tried to make a $730 million loan to a company owned by a Russian oligarch so he could build a steel plant to compete with American steel companies and steelworkers that are already making this product. Why in the world should my constituents be forced to subsidize a Russian oligarch? This is ridiculous. And by the way, the plant had already been built. It was retroactively funding facilities that he already had the resources to build. This is just crazy. This is what drives people crazy. The GAO has recommended three times that this program be terminated. They have estimated that if the program continues, they are going to lose another $400 million. So here we have Washington picking a handful of preferred companies to get huge taxpayer subsidies. It has proven it is a losing program. Why are we doing this in the first place? So we have an amendment that would end this program. Senator Coats, Senator Fischer and myself want to end this. We don't want taxpayers to continue to subsidize these companies. We don't think crony capitalism is the way our system should work. We think our economy should work for everybody who shows up and punches a clock and works hard, not the well-connected who can get a big subsidy from Washington. So we have an amendment that would end it. Now, there is some controversy about whether we are even going to have a vote on this, which is really disturbing. I hope we can resolve this and have this vote. I will live with the consequences of this vote, as we all have to. But if there are people who like this program and think that our taxpayers should continue being forced to give away money and subsidize preferred special interests, OK, come on down to the floor and make the case. Argue for why we should continue this crony capitalism, and why it is that politicians ought to put their thumbs on the scale of our economy and divert taxpayer dollars to preferred interests. Come on down and make the case. At least have the courage of your convictions, and let's have a vote. That is all I am asking for. So I am hoping we will get this. I am hoping we will have a vote and, of course, I am hoping we will end a terrible program that undermines the confidence the American people have in our government. We could take a step in the right direction of restoring some confidence that this town can figure out what to do and can take steps to help our economy be fairer, more open, and more successful for all Americans. I thank the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2355] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ATVM LOAN PROGRAM Mr. TOOMEY.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2028, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Pending: Alexander/Feinstein amendment No. 3801, in the nature of a substitute. Alexander amendment No. 3804 (to amendment No. 3801), to modify provisions relating to Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees. Alexander (for Hoeven) amendment No. 3811 (to amendment No. 3801), to prohibit the use of funds relating to a certain definition. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Amendment No. 3811 Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I understand that shortly we are going to be voting on the Hoeven amendment. The Hoeven amendment would prevent the clean water rule from going into effect. In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act in response to what was happening around this country. We saw rivers literally catch on fire as a result of polluted waterways. We had Lake Erie, which was considered dead. The Chesapeake Bay was one of the world's first marine dead zones. That is nothing to be proud of. The environment and status of our water was a national disgrace, and through congressional leadership, we passed the Clean Water Act. We did that because we understood that the status of upstream water affects the status of downstream water--that we are all in this together. We understood that having clean water was a public health issue, from swimming in the water to the source of our drinking water supplies. One third of our drinking water supplies come from regulated waters. We also understood it was important for our economy. The status of tourism very much depended upon the quality of our water. Literally, people were concerned about going close to some of our inner harbor water areas. The Baltimore Inner Harbor is a tourist attraction, as are the inner harbors of many of our cities. It is important for our economy for agriculture. Agriculture depends upon clean water. We understood that when we passed the Clean Water Act in 1972. And we also understood it was a matter of quality of life for the people in our country. From those who hike and do bird watching to those who enjoy fishing and hunting, the status of clean water very much affects the way we enjoy life. As Senators from Maryland, Senator Mikulski and I both understand the importance of clean water for the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and the largest estuary in our hemisphere. It was at great risk because of waters coming in from other States into the Chesapeake Bay watershed, affecting the quality of water of the Chesapeake Bay. It was for all those reasons that we passed the 1972 Clean Water Act. We understood the enforcement of the waters that were regulated under the 1972 Clean Water Act. It was based upon best science. Science told us what we needed to do in order to have clean water-- clean water for our environment, clean water for safe drinking water-- and it was well understood until a Supreme Court decision. That decision in 2006, known as the Rapanos decision, was a 5-to-4 decision of the Supreme Court, which remanded the case, but it was a 4-to-4 decision on the merits of the case. Since that time, there has been uncertainty as to what bodies of water can be regulated under the Clean Water Act. So this was a situation caused by the ambiguity of the Supreme Court case. It is interesting that the decision on the merits was 4-to-4, as we are now debating whether we are going to have a full Supreme Court in order to make decisions that affect the clarity of law in this country. The Rapanos decision sent back to the lower courts a decision on how to decide this. Since that time, there has been uncertainty as to what bodies are legally regulated under the 1972 Clean Water Act. Remember, this was 2006. The easiest way to resolve this was for Congress to pass a law clarifying the Clean Water Act, but Congress has chosen not to do that. So the Obama administration has done what it should do, using its power to promulgate a regulation that would provide clarity as to which bodies of water are regulated. Guess what. They have done that in a way that is consistent with how the law was enforced prior to the Rapanos decision--without much complaint before the Rapanos decision. It basically goes back to best science and tells us logically what needs to be regulated. That is what this rule would do: Protect our clean water. There is a lot of misinformation that has been given about the clean water rule. Quite frankly, normal farming activities don't require any permits under the Clean Water Act. If we listen to some of the arguments against the Clean Water Act, we would have a hard time comparing that to what, in fact, is in the bill. The Clean Water Act would reestablish the well-thought regulatory framework for protecting our clean water so that we don't return to the days of jeopardizing the Chesapeake Bay or jeopardizing our rivers or jeopardizing our clean water supplies or our environment. Tomorrow is Earth Day. Forty-six years ago, our colleague Senator Gaylord Nelson established Earth Day. What will this Congress's legacy be? What will we be remembered for in regards to protecting this planet, protecting our country, and protecting our environment for future generations? I [[Page S2358]] hope we will work together to build on the proud accomplishments of our predecessors for clean air and clean water. The first thing we can do is to make sure we reject the Hoeven amendment. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. I am pleased to see Senators Alexander and Feinstein working to put together a good, bipartisan bill with no ideological or partisan policy riders. They remind us of the way that we should be doing business here in the Senate. This legislation provides increased funding for infrastructure across the Nation and in my home State of Illinois, and I was proud to support it in the Appropriations Committee. The bill provides strong funding for the National Labs through the Department of Energy, including critical research programs at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. These labs are supporting thousands of scientists from across the country and around the world as they perform pioneering research and transform technologies for science and industry. Lab facilities in Illinois perform cutting-edge research and are a bright example of American innovation. The Energy and Water Appropriations bill would invest $6 billion in the Army Corps of Engineers, which will help support important investments in Illinois infrastructure. Waterways in Illinois, including the Mississippi River, are critical to commerce around the country. They provide access for shipped goods, connecting the Great Lakes with the Gulf of Mexico. The Army Corps also plays an important role in flood control projects, something we saw firsthand in Illinois and across the Mississippi valley area after flooding this past winter. But there is always more work to be done. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, America scores a D-minus in investment in levees and inland waterways, and a D in investment in dams. This bill is a good start to making the critical investments we need in American infrastructure. So I am not sure why, after Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein pulled together such a strong bipartisan bill, Republicans would want to try to add a poison pill rider preventing an EPA rule that keeps our water clean. Many economists and military leaders tell us that water will be to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th century. Water is going to be that indispensable commodity that makes progress possible; an essential commodity over which wars will be fought. The United States has more clean water today than any other nation on the planet, and it is because of the Great Lakes. Why would we knowingly, deliberately, spoil this precious commodity that is a source of conflict between other nations? We can't afford to stop making a real difference in our clean water supply, and let me tell you why. The EPA and Army Corps clean water rule provides stronger water quality standards to protect our Nation's streams, wetlands, and navigable water. These are all resources that we rely heavily on for drinking water and recreation. And one in three Americans, or 117 million people, get drinking water from sources that were vulnerable to pollution before the clean water rule. Now, more than ever, we must work to ensure our water is safe. We know what can happen when our water supply isn't protected. The Flint, MI, water contamination crisis and high lead levels in the water supply in other communities across the country and in Illinois are reminders of this. But it is not just lead that we have to worry about. Pollutants from factories and sewage treatment plants; waste from confined animal feeding operations; pesticides used on crops; and mining wastewater all flow into tributaries that eventually flow into the Great Lakes, the source of clean water for 35 million people. Attempts to roll back the clean water rule will not only return us to a patchwork of water protections that make it difficult for businesses, farmers, and others to know whether waterways are covered by the law. It will also risk one of our greatest commodities that supports agriculture, recreation, tourism, and energy production. To see the impacts of rolling back these protections, we need to look no further than the Gulf of Mexico, which has one of the largest dead zones in the world. Let me tell you what a dead zone is: Dead zones are the result of an overabundance of algae growth, which eventually decompose and steal oxygen from the water, making it hard for anything to live. Nutrient runoff from 12 States along the Mississippi River trickles down into the Gulf of Mexico. Last year, the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico reached 6,474 square miles, roughly the size of the State of Connecticut. The State of Illinois was one of the largest contributors to this nutrient overload, a combination of runoff from our farm fields and point source pollution such as wastewater plants. We need to reduce this nutrient runoff while protecting our agriculture economy in Illinois. The clean water rule does exactly that by exempting agricultural activities from its provisions. I urge my colleagues to vote against any ideological poison pill amendment that would prevent clean water appropriations from moving forward to protect our children, our communities, and our economy. Without ideological riders like the clean water rule amendment, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill is a bipartisan effort that proves we can make smart investments that make the most sense for our country--right now and as we plan for our future. The current lead crisis has shown that we need to get serious about investing in infrastructure programs and support regulations to ensure that every American--especially children--has access to safe, clean drinking water. Now is the time for Congress to act responsibly to develop a budget that enables our country to thrive. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The Senator from Indiana. Wasteful Spending Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this is No. 40 of ``Waste of the Week.'' For the 40 weeks the Senate has been in session this cycle, I have come down to the Floor to talk about a waste of taxpayers' dollars through waste, fraud, and abuse. This week I am going to talk about yet another Federal program which has, at best, a questionable track record. I filed an amendment to the Energy and Water appropriations bill currently in the Senate, which is related to this program, and hopefully we will be voting on the amendment I will be offering in a few moments to address this issue. This amendment, which I offered with Senators Fischer, Toomey, and Flake, would finally wind down the Department of Energy's failed Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. Remember the stimulus? Remember how we were throwing all kinds of taxpayers' money out there? We talked about advanced vehicle programs, and many of these distributions of funds have been misused or simply have not come to fruition, and a great deal of money has been wasted. The ATVM Loan Program continues to sit on billions of dollars of unused funds that could be put to better use. I am glad there are some unused funds there because it means that when we look at the history of this program, perhaps we will have an opportunity to better use those unused funds or to help return it back to the Treasury so the taxpayer isn't on the hook for this kind of thing going forward. Let me explain this program. The Department of Energy's Advanced Vehicle Technology Manufacturing Loan Program was created in 2007. It was created to provide very low-interest loans to manufacturers that make vehicles or components of vehicles that use alternative energy. I am not here to downplay the use of alternative energy. I think that is something that is happening throughout our country. Hopefully, it is on a market basis. To qualify for this loan, there were a couple of requirements applicants must meet: No. 1, the vehicle or component must be new or significantly improved from what is currently available in the U.S. marketplace; No. 2, it has to be manufactured in the United States. The purpose of the program, partly, was to encourage manufacturing here--not in China, not somewhere else. [[Page S2359]] Last month, nearly 10 years since the program's inception, the Government Accountability Office took a look at the program's finances and found that the Department of Energy has billions of unused and unspent funds. I am glad they do because a lot of things that have taken place under this program have not proven to be worth their weight. I have spoken before on a number of programs, but in 2011, under this fund--the Alternative Vehicle Fund--the Obama administration approved a $730 million loan to a company called Severstal Steel Company, a Russian-owned company with operations in Michigan. Remember, to qualify for this loan, the alternative fuel vehicle or vehicle part needs to be manufactured in the United States and--here is the key--it must be a new product. Technically, Severstal was manufacturing in the United States, but the Obama administration certainly walked the line in this case. The U.S. Government was providing American taxpayer dollars to a Russian company owned by one of Russia's richest oligarchs, Alexei Mordashov. The New York Times has reported that Mr. Mordashov has ties to the Kremlin and to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Apparently, this Russian looked at this program and said: Hey, here is a way I can get a low-cost, low-interest loan. All I have to do is operate this plant and the government will loan me $750 million and I will produce a new part, a new component of steel that is used in automobile manufacturing. After working with the Department of Energy's inspector general, Senator Toomey and I learned that the type of steel made by this Russian company was identical to the steel already being produced in my home State of Indiana and Senator Toomey's home State of Pennsylvania. Obviously, that violated one of the basic criteria in that the product has to be an alternative that is brand new or significantly improved and not something that is already being produced in Indiana. Fortunately, with the help of the inspector general, we were able to ensure the Obama administration voided the loan. To their credit, when we brought it to their attention, they said: OK. We have a Russian oligarch we are giving money to--and that doesn't sound very good. We are giving money to this multibillionaire in Russia with close ties to Vladimir Putin. Secondly, we now have learned what they are producing is already produced in the United States--in my State of Indiana and in Senator Toomey's State of Pennsylvania. Thus, fortunately, the administration canceled this loan. This example calls into question the integrity of this program. The ATVM Program also has a lackluster success rate. For example, Fisker Automotive received a $529 million loan to produce a $100,000 plug-in hybrid sports car. You will not see any of these on the road because the company went bankrupt after drawing down $193 million of taxpayer funds. Another loan recipient, VPG, planned to sell natural gas-powered vans. It went bankrupt after receiving a $50 million government loan. Of the five projects funded by this program to date, two of them have gone bankrupt. I think these examples demonstrate what happens when the government tries to pick winners and losers instead of letting the free market determine how we are going to go forward. The Coats-Fischer-Flake-Toomey amendment that will be offered would wind down this program and it would make much better use of the unspent funds from this program. I want to be clear. This amendment prohibits DOE from reviewing any new loan applications after the bill's enactment. There are currently some pending applications. We do not address those pending applications. I hope serious evaluation will be made relative to whether they qualify under the criteria that is laid out and we will not end up with any more Severstals. Those who argue that this shuts down an alternative energy program is not valid. Anything that is now being currently evaluated up through the end of 2020, the next 5 years--will be allowed to go forward and be evaluated under the program. The amendment doesn't take that away. CBO scored this amendment as saving at least $300 million over the next 10 years. I have been down here every week talking about a waste of the week. I have just identified another waste of taxpayer dollars. We are not counting that, but we are counting what we can save if this amendment is adopted. It is $300 million. I think that is a significant amount it raises our waste, fraud, and abuse level to $162 billion and change. I encourage my colleagues to work with us so we can offer this amendment. Remember, it does not affect anybody who has a proposal before the Department of Energy under this loan program. If that is underway, it can be evaluated--hopefully successfully evaluated, and if it doesn't qualify the criteria, won't be accepted. The amendment does not free funds for anything that is not currently before the evaluators of this program. I trust we can gain the support of my colleagues in saving the taxpayers some dollars. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3811 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are going to vote on the Hoeven amendment shortly. I rise to speak against that amendment, which would undermine one of our Nation's landmark environmental laws, the Clean Water Act. It is very difficult for me to understand how we could be at this point in time attacking a clean water rule--a clean water rule in light of what has happened in Flint, MI. This is what the water looked like as it came out of the tap in Flint at the height of the crisis. By the way, people were told this was safe. Why on Earth would we be going against the clean water rule at a time when we are fighting against this kind of problem? This is what the pipes looked like in Flint: the corrosion, the obvious problems with lead. This was all getting right into the drinking water. While we look for ways to help the people of Flint--and I would love do it on this bill. If we can't do it on this bill, I would love do it on the WRDA bill. If we can't do it on the WRDA bill, I will do it on any bill. We need to take care of what happened there, and we also need to help other communities from the east coast to the middle of our Nation, to the west coast and help us help our families. Here we have in the face of Flint an attack on the clean water rule. Let's see what else we have to say and what else we learned about what happened in Flint. Pregnant women, kids cautioned over Jackson water. This is in Mississippi. Jackson, MS, also has a problem with lead. What is our response to that today? To stop a clean water rule. What are my Republican friends thinking? It doesn't make sense. The Associated Press wrote this: ``Elevated lead levels found in Newark schools' drinking water.'' Here we are talking about elevated levels of lead in Newark. We have places in California where the kids can't drink the water out of a water fountain. So what is the response of the Republican Senate? Turn back a clean water rule. It makes absolutely no sense. What we have going on, on the Senate floor, is a very heated debate, as I speak, about how to handle the issue in Flint. Let me tell you this. The first thing to do in the light of Flint is not to weaken environmental law, is not to stop a clean water rule. It is completely ridiculous. My friends will say: All we are doing is delaying implementation for a year while the court looks at it. We shouldn't be doing anything that plays into the hands of those special interests that simply don't want to clean up the water in our Nation. The clean water standards that are a target of this amendment are designed to safeguard drinking water for America's families and businesses. This dangerous amendment rolls back protections of small streams and wetlands that provide drinking water to one in three Americans. That is 117 million people put at risk because this U.S. Senate, run by the Republicans, [[Page S2360]] thinks the best thing to do in the light of Flint is to roll back the Clean Water Act. Come on. Get a life. Read the paper. Look at what happened to those people. This is the time to provide reliable drinking water to all Americans and to clean up our waterways. Now is not the time--and it should not be the time--to attack the Clean Water Act, which is vital to the health and safety of our families. I want to mention that I have received opposition to the Hoeven amendment from numerous sportsmen's groups, including Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, International Federation of Fly Fishers, National Wildlife Federation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, and Trout Unlimited. These groups understand the important link between clean water and the outdoor recreation economy. When you go right after the clean water rule, you are going after the people who enjoy outdoor recreation, and they are against the Hoeven amendment. Leading environmental and conservation groups oppose the amendment, including American Rivers, Clean Water Action, Earthjustice, Earthworks, Environment America, Environmental Defense Fund, League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council, Prairie Rivers Network, Sierra Club, and Southern Environmental Law Center. These are some of the most popular groups in the country. Does anyone know what the rating of this Republican Congress was in the last polls I saw? It was 14 percent. Do you know what the rating of the President was in the last poll I saw? Over 50. So what does the Republican Senate do today? They are going after the President with their 14-percent rating in the polls. I say to my friends on the other side--and believe me, they are my friends: What are you doing? How do you expect people to support you when you, after seeing what happened in Flint, continue to go after landmark environmental clean water laws like you are doing today? In addition, public health groups, including the American Public Health Association, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Trust for America's Health, have opposed similar legislation to block this important rule, and 200,000 businesses represented by the American Sustainable Business Council have called on Senators to oppose efforts to block the clean water rule. These experts understand the importance of the clean water rule, and they know that our drinking water remains vulnerable to pollution. Just last month, EPA released a report showing that nearly half of U.S. waterways are in poor condition. In fact, one in four waterways have levels of bacteria that fail to meet human health standards, and our children go swimming in these very waterways. We have cities across the United States with sewer systems that discharge raw, untreated sewage in waterways--again, where our children swim. It is a disgrace. Despite enormous successes since passage of the Clean Water Act, we have more work to do. Nothing is more important than protecting the lives of the American people, whether it is through our military or through our public health laws. When we weaken the Clean Water Act, as the Hoeven amendment will do, we put our families and our children at risk. Why are we here? Flint has put a spotlight on the need to keep our families safe from toxins and pollutants in their drinking water. The first thing the Republicans do in light of Flint is to try to roll back the clean water rule. I have to say that one of my deepest regrets--and I have written about it--is how partisan this place has become over environmental laws. When I started a long time ago, Republicans were the ones leading the way on the environment. I remember there was a Republican State senator named Peter Behr, whom I supported because he understood how critical it was to protect and defend the environment, not only as a legacy to our children in terms of the beauty of our planet but also for the very health and safety of our families. I have been in office for 40 years. It is hard to believe that it has been 40 years. I guess time flies when you like your work. The fact is that no one has ever come up to me and said: Barbara, our water and air is too pure and way too clean. You need to do something about that. You need to dirty it up. Repeal the landmark laws, Barbara, that protect our water. They don't do that. They come up and say: We are worried about the fact that we are not sure what contaminants are in our water. I see my good friend is going to close out the debate, and I promised him that when he came to the floor, he wouldn't have to listen too long. I say again: Please vote against the Hoeven amendment. This is not smart legislation in light of what we face. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I will yield the floor to the good Senator from Michigan for a minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wanted to make a quick statement about an amendment that will come up for consideration on the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, of course I support my friend from Michigan, but we need to quickly move to a vote on the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wanted to quickly take a moment to speak about the vehicle program from two sides. When I authored this legislation back in 2007, we began to see fuel economy standards increase in the United States. Part of our focus at that time was to keep jobs in America and make sure we had low-cost financing available for companies, such as retool plants, so that smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles would be made in the United States rather than have those jobs shipped overseas. We saw that with the initial loan made to Ford Motor Company. They were able to bring jobs back from Mexico and also focus on electric vehicles. As we fast forward to today, we are looking at fuel economy for trucks and larger vehicles. A loan was recently made to Alcoa. They are focused on aluminum materials so companies can make lighter weight trucks in order to meet new fuel economy standards. There are positives, but there are also areas under this loan program that have not been successful. I come to the floor to specifically say that when it is time to consider the Coats amendment, which will completely eliminate this program, my colleagues need to know that we are undercutting a carefully crafted bipartisan compromise with Senator Inhofe, Senator Portman, and others to move forward on a water infrastructure plan to deal with lead in water that will not only help 100,000 people in the city of Flint, but it will also help people in Jackson, MS, Cleveland, OH, and other States across the country. Our proposal responsibly phases out this program and uses the funds for critical water infrastructure needs. We strongly oppose pulling the rug out from under not only Flint but also Jackson, MS, Cleveland, OH, and communities across the country that are counting on us to come together and pass what we have done in a bipartisan way to address critical water infrastructure needs and deal with the lead poisoning issues. I ask colleagues to vote no on the Coats amendment and allow us to phase out this program in a way so that we will be able to use this investment in a critical way to address water infrastructure needs across the country. I thank the Presiding Officer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am willing to yield to the junior Senator from Michigan. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I concur with my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow. We urge our colleagues [[Page S2361]] to vote no on the Coats amendment. This is part of a very carefully crafted amendment to deal with water infrastructure around the country, and in particular Flint. I think this will be a win-win for those folks who may want to see this program go away. We have a plan to do that while also dealing with an incredibly important issue not only for our State but that is also incredibly important to other States across the country. I urge a ``no'' vote. I thank the Senator for yielding the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Amendment No. 3811 Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support an amendment I offered, amendment No. 3811, that prevents the EPA and the Corps of Engineers from implementing its waters of the United States final rule. The language for my amendment is actually identical to the waters of the United States provision in the underlying bill. It is already in the bill, H.R. 2028, which we are considering right now. My amendment will make sure that this waters of the United States provision stays in the bill and that our bill is consistent with legislation supported by the House. It is critical to preserve the prohibition on implementing the waters of the United States because this rule will greatly expand the scope of EPA regulations over nearly every water in the United States, threatening farmers and job creators with permitting requirements and litigation that will make it more difficult for them to produce our Nation's food and complete needed construction projects. Moreover, this regulatory overreach by the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA is inconsistent with the law. Let's look at what the courts are saying. When granting a preliminary injunction against this rule, the North Dakota Federal District Court stated: The Rule allows EPA regulation of waters that do not bear any effect on the ``chemical, physical and biological integrity'' of any navigable-in-fact water. It went on further to state: The rule asserts jurisdiction over waters that are remote and intermittent waters. No evidence actually points to how these intermittent and remote wetlands have any nexus to navigable-in-fact water. That is the key. EPA has jurisdiction over navigable bodies of water, not ephemeral water that might be in a ditch today and gone tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a nationwide stay of the rule, in Cincinnati, citing that EPA and the Corps of Engineers did not identify ``specific scientific support substantiating the reasonableness of the bright-line standards they ultimately chose.'' To get a sense of the size of the Federal power grab we are talking about here, consider that under the administration's final rule, all water located within 4,000 feet of any other water or within the 100- year floodplain is considered a water of the United States as long as the EPA or the Army Corps of Engineers decides that it has ``significant nexus.'' That is the argument the EPA is making-- ``significant nexus.'' They are saying: Well, we can regulate navigable bodies of water. They just decided, without statutory authority provided by this Congress or any other authority, that because other waters run into navigable bodies, they can regulate all water, and they have issued a regulation to do that. The waters of the United States is clearly flawed from a legal perspective, but it is even more important to take a look at how this rule, if implemented, affects hard-working Americans with excessive regulations. For those of you who haven't had the opportunity to visit with a farmer from my State or any farmers across this country, do so. They will tell you how difficult it is to deal with excess water on their property, particularly when they face an overbearing regulation like this one. Those farmers can tell you that just because there is water in a ditch or field one week doesn't mean that there will be water there next week. It certainly doesn't make the water worthy of being treated the same as a river, a lake, or a navigable body of water. A field with a low spot that has standing water---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask that the Members of this body not only consider the underlying issue and the impact it will have on farmers and ranchers. It will also affect everybody's private property rights. I also ask my colleagues to consider their own prerogative. Under our Constitution we have legislative, judicial, and executive branches, and each has its own authority. We have to stand up on this one when an agency overreaches and takes statutory authority we have not provided. I ask that Members join with me in support of this vitally important amendment. With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following locking in the votes, the Senator from California have an opportunity to speak and then that we move to the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up the following amendments: Franken amendment No. 3833, Coats amendment No. 3814, and Murray amendment No. 3813; further, that following the disposition of the Hoeven amendment No. 3811, the Senate vote on the Coats amendment No. 3814, with a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption of the amendment; and that at 1:45 p.m. today, the Senate vote on the Franken amendment No. 3833; finally, that at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, April 25, the Senate vote on the Murray amendment No. 3813, with no second-degree amendments in order to any of the amendments prior to the votes, and that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote. May I say before the Senator from California speaks, I see the Senators from Michigan are here and the Senator from Indiana. I wish to thank the three of them for working with Senator Feinstein and me toward the goal of making sure that Senators who have a germane amendment have the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote. If we are able to follow that practice generally, we will be able to have an appropriations process and the Senate will function well. They all responded quickly and promptly on issues they feel very strongly about, and I thank them for it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from California. Amendment No. 3811 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words. The junior Senator from California has been speaking in opposition to the waters of the United States amendment sponsored by Senator Hoeven. I just want to put before the body a little bit of the history. In 2006 the Supreme Court introduced real uncertainty regarding which wetlands and water bodies were subject to Federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Since 2006 the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been working on new rules to clarify their jurisdiction and address the Supreme Court's ruling. EPA and the Army Corps just finalized the new rule last May. This new rule helps resolve almost a decade of confusion by clearly stating which types of water bodies are subject to Federal jurisdiction and which are not. It will make Federal permitting easier, faster, and less costly for business and industry. It maintains all previous exemptions and exclusions for normal farming and ranching practices and agricultural discharges, such as irrigation return flow and storm water runoff. Nevertheless, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has issued a stay suspending implementation of the rule. I strongly believe we should let the courts decide whether the executive branch has overreached in its interpretation of congressional statute, just like the Constitution calls for. The President has threatened to veto the entire Energy and Water appropriations bill if this amendment is included in it. Right now, we have the best opportunity in 7 years to pass this bill as a stand-alone piece of legislation and [[Page S2362]] get the Senate appropriations process working again. So I am very hopeful and would strongly recommend that the Senate defeat the Hoeven amendment. Thank you very much, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Hoeven amendment No. 3811. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in a moment Senator Coats will call up his amendment, the Coats and Toomey amendment. I want to thank the Michigan Senators and others for making the schedule work today. For the information of all Senators, after the Coats amendment, the next vote will be at 1:45 p.m. on the Franken amendment. That will be the last vote today. The next vote will be on the Murray amendment on Monday afternoon. Senators and their staffs have been very good about getting their amendments in. We think we have all the amendments. We have asked to have them by 1 p.m. so we could by consensus finish up on Monday and Tuesday, giving everybody a chance to have their vote if it is a germane amendment and to speak on the germane amendments. My request on behalf of Senator Feinstein and me is that if there are any amendments still out there, we would like to have them by 1 o'clock. Amendment No. 3814 to Amendment No. 3801 The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 3814, to be offered by the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Coats. Mr. COATS. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3814. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] proposes an amendment numbered 3814 to amendment No. 3801. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To limit the use of funds made available for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program) On page 30, line 9, strike the period at the end and insert the following: ``: Provided, That none of the funds made available under this heading shall be used to administer, review, or approve any loan or loan application that was not submitted as of the date of enactment of this Act: Provided further, that none of the funds available to the Secretary of Energy to provide any credit subsidy under subsection (d) of section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17013) as of the date of enactment of this Act shall be obligated for new loan commitments under that subsection on or after October 1, 2020.''. Mr. COATS. Madam President, 205 loans issued by the Department of Energy under the alternative vehicle program have failed, costing taxpayers $500 million in losses. DOE currently sits on $4 billion of unused money. It is time to wind down this program. This will not affect any proposals that are currently with the Department of Energy on this program, but it will prevent any new programs going forward. We can save the taxpayers a lot of money and use this for other alternatives if we adopt this amendment. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Pennsylvania. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, this is exactly the kind of program our constituents hate. It is the crony capitalism where taxpayers are forced to subsidize preferred companies, special interests. How many hundreds of millions of dollars do taxpayers have to lose? I understand there is some discussion that maybe on some bill in the future, this will get phased out as part of another deal, but who knows if that is ever going to happen. Here is a chance to wipe out some crony capitalism, some corporate welfare, and a huge loss for taxpayers. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. TOOMEY. Let's adopt this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I would certainly urge all of my colleagues to oppose the Coats amendment. What this does is eliminate a program that basically pays for a very carefully crafted agreement on which we are working to deal with the Flint water issue, as well as water infrastructure issues all across this country. This is part of the proposal Senator Stabenow and I have been working on and have been building support. We are looking to move to this very shortly to deal with this broad issue. A vote against this amendment allows us to continue to move forward with a bipartisan plan, critical for our whole country. I yield my remaining time to the senior Senator from Michigan. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, the bottom line is that we have developed a bipartisan bill that phases out this program in a responsible way for the businesses that are currently involved and uses that to pay for water infrastructure needs across the country, not only in Flint but in Jackson, MI, and Cleveland, OH--across the country. So we can achieve what the Senators are talking about in a way that helps us with water infrastructure. I urge a ``no'' vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3814. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 49, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 58 Leg.] YEAS--48 Ayotte Barrasso Boozman Burr Capito Coats Cochran Collins Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner [[Page S2363]] Graham Grassley Hatch Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kirk Lankford Lee McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Paul Perdue Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Wicker NAYS--49 Alexander Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coons Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Kaine King Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murkowski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Portman Reed Reid Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wyden NOT VOTING--3 Blunt Cruz Sanders The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. The Senator from Arizona. Tribute to Sandy Ledy Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Sandy Ledy, a dedicated Senate staff member who will retire after more than two decades of public service in my office. Soon after being elected to the Senate in 1994, Senator John Kyl was wise enough to offer Sandy--a standout campaign volunteer--a job on his new staff. Sandy was given two options: She could work as a staffer in Washington, DC, or she could serve in Arizona and serve as John Kyl's military case worker. Sandy knew she couldn't pass up an opportunity to serve those who serve our Nation. It was an easy decision for Sandy and a fortuitous one for Arizona's military servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Sandy's genuine passion for our military service men and women, combined with her meticulous approach to her work, has made her an invaluable staffer. Sandy is well-versed in all things military, from regulations, to benefits, to the service academies. Her vast knowledge has ensured that Arizona's military service men and women have had nothing but the best assistance for more than the past two decades. Her reputation preceded her, and when I was elected as Senator in 2012, I had an easy decision of my own--offering Sandy a job on my staff. Thankfully, she said yes. Sandy is probably best known around the State as the point person for service academy nominations. Her understanding of that process and what it takes for a student to be an excellent nominee has helped so many students fulfill their dreams of attending one of our prestigious service academies. Her focus on preparation and attention to detail has turned what can be a very daunting task into a seamless production, resulting in countless nominations and appointments to the service academies. While we all marvel at Sandy's meticulousness, it is her compassion and calm demeanor that make her such an asset. This is never more evident than when she is working with students and parents in the long and complicated process of applying to attend one of these service academies. Beyond her work on behalf of the military, she is an active and cherished member of her community in Cave Creek, AZ. She is a member of her church choir, a regular volunteer at the Cave Creek Museum, and a longtime swim coach, sometimes judging local meets. But there is no better testament to Sandy's example as a public servant than her two children, Amy and Joe. Amy is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy who herself recently retired after a career in the military. Joe served in the U.S. Marine Corps. They have made her the proud grandmother of three, and she is looking forward to spending a well-deserved retirement looking after those grandkids. Sandy, thank you for more than 20 years of dedicated public service in the Senate and, in particular, for the 4 years of stellar service as a member of my staff. Your knowledge and passion will be greatly missed. I wish you well in your retirement. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am on the floor with my colleague Senator Portman to join him in urging the House to take prompt action on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which passed with such a stunning bipartisan vote in the Senate. As Senator Portman has pointed out, years of careful preparation went into the drafting of this bill. There were five separate national hearings held in Washington with people from all over the country. This is a very polished and carefully developed piece of legislative work that has the support not only of the addiction and recovery community but of the law enforcement community and many others. Senator Portman has been very diligent about coming to the floor to press for action from the House of Representatives. My view is that since the House of Representatives is under Republican control, they are more likely to be attentive to the urgings of a Republican Senator--particularly one who has served in the House of Representatives--than they are to me. But I want to make sure the record is clear that I fully support rapid passage of this bill, whether it is something that is close enough that we can quickly get it through conference or whether it is our bill, to which they are free to add things as they wish over time, but can get to the President now--the reason I think it is important that it get to the President now is we are in the appropriations process. The appropriators for these accounts need to know what they are appropriating to. So time is of the essence, not just because of the lives that are being lost day-to-day and month-to-month out there but also because our appropriators need to know. I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives, Democrats and Republicans alike, to listen to the distinguished Senator from Ohio. Let's try to get this done. With that, I yield to Senator Portman with my thanks and appreciation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. First, Madam President, I want to thank my colleague from Rhode Island who just spoke. We did work together for the past few years in putting together this legislation, and we did it, by the way, with the House of Representatives. So Senator Whitehouse and I took good ideas wherever we could find them, in whatever part of the country it came from, including ideas from the House of Representatives. We didn't ask who had the idea; we asked whether it was a good idea. We kept this entirely nonpartisan, not just bipartisan. Therefore, we built something that makes sense for our communities back home to deal with this epidemic of prescription drug and heroin addiction and overdoses. I appreciate his partnership in this, and I appreciate the fact that he came to the floor today to talk about the importance of moving ahead with this legislation. After all, it is very rare around here to get a 94-to-1 vote on anything, and we did it on this bill. After 2\1/2\ weeks on the floor of the Senate talking about this heroin and prescription drug epidemic, every single Senator here realized this was a problem in their States, and 94 Senators stood up and agreed this legislation will help address it. By the way, since we passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, as it is called, on March 10 in the Senate, 42 days have passed. That is more than a month. Every day, we lose about 120 Americans--120 Americans--to drug overdoses. That means in these 42 days we have lost over 5,000 fellow American citizens to drug overdoses. Think about that. I do urge the House to act and act quickly. These numbers keep getting higher and higher. This is not getting better. Back in Ohio, this is getting worse, and I assume the same is true in your State, if you are a Senator or if you are a Member of the House of Representatives in your district. Since 2007, we have looked at these numbers, and drug overdoses have killed more Ohioans than car accidents. It is now the No. 1 cause of accidental death in Ohio. It has tripled [[Page S2364]] from 1999 to 2010. We are now told, by the way, that 200,000 Ohioans are addicted to opioids--opioids are prescription drugs--and heroin-- 200,000 Ohioans. That is the size of a significant city in any State represented here in this body or any district on the other side. In fact, it is the same size as the city of Akron, OH, where I was on Monday of this week, meeting with their opioid task force. They are alarmed at what is happening, and they want to be sure we are making every possible effort we can on the prevention side, the education side, to get more people into treatment, to get them into longer term recovery, to provide police officers and other first responders with Narcan, the miracle drug they need to stop overdoses from turning into a death. They want our help. They support the CARA legislation. They need it, and they need it now. The Cincinnati Enquirer had some really troubling news last week. They wrote a story about a new poll that is out. It is a group called Interact for Health. They do an annual Ohio health issues poll. They found in the poll in 2014 that 2 of every 10 Ohioans knew someone who was abusing prescription drugs. A year later, it is 3 in 10, so this is not getting better. This is getting worse. By the way, this is just prescription drugs. And by the way, of the 3 in 10 who knew somebody who is abusing prescription drugs, 4 in 10--4 in 10--knew somebody who had overdosed on those prescription drugs. So these percentages are increasing across the board--every age group, every education level, every income level. There is no demographic, no ZIP Code, no State, no city, and no county that is safe from this epidemic. It is spreading, and it is spreading everywhere. This poll is another indication that we have a lot of work to do. This should be a motivation for us. This should get us to pass this legislation. And, yes, can we work on additional legislation? Of course, we can and should. I am encouraged that the House is taking up new bills and looking at this in different ways. That is good. But we know here in the Senate and over in the House that this CARA legislation will help and will help now. By the way, there are over 120 cosponsors of the CARA legislation in the House. Not only did we work with them and introduce identical legislation in the House and the Senate, anticipating this day when we could pass it in one House, but we wanted to pass it quickly in the other House and get it to the President for his signature. There are over 120 cosponsors over there. It is bipartisan. Think of the impact we could have on the community if we could get this passed. If we could turn around just one life, it matters, and we know this can save many lives and make many people begin to look at this issue differently--that this is a disease. Addiction is a disease and needs to be treated as such. Removing some of that stigma alone will bring a lot more people into treatment, and that is part of what is important about this legislation. There is another issue that is not prescription drugs, and it is not heroin, but it is another issue related to it, and that is fentanyl. Fentanyl is being laced with heroin throughout the country. In Cleveland, OH, a couple of weeks ago, we lost 12 people--12 people--in 6 days to overdoses. That is one city. This was heroin, but it was laced with this even more dangerous toxic substance called fentanyl. By the way, it comes in the mail. The drug dealers are shipping it in the mail. Fentanyl is so toxic--10 to 30 to 40 times more toxic than heroin-- that it is dangerous even to open up the mail if you are an inspector, we are told. We had a hearing on this just this week. We talked to the Customs and Border Patrol people: Our question was, Why can't we stop this stuff from coming in? This, unfortunately, is something that is also increasing. Ohio, they say, is one of the top States in the country in terms of fentanyl overdoses. But I will tell those who have not dealt with this fentanyl issue yet that it creates even more issues because it is so deadly. After 3 years of work on this CARA legislation, Senator Whitehouse and I and others, including Senators on both sides of the aisle--we did hold five forums, as he said, on various aspects of this debate. We consulted with the experts on treatment and recovery, the experts who are focused on how to keep kids and other people from making these bad decisions in the prevention and the education community. We met with the drug experts from the administration, such as the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. We brought in people from all over the country, including from my home State of Ohio. This is the third time I have come to the floor. I have come once every week that we have been in session since we passed it to say to the House: Let's move on CARA. Let's get it done. It will help immediately. The majority leader in the House has said he wants the House to take on the drug epidemic and pass legislation soon. I believe him. He is a good man. I appreciate that. But I would ask him again to please work on the other legislation. It is fine to take them through hearings and markups, but we cannot delay. We know CARA will work, and it will work now. It is sitting over there and ready for action. It can be taken to the floor immediately under suspension and can be passed. We are one vote away from having this go to the President and having it go to help in our communities. The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Fred Upton, who is a good friend and a man with a big heart and cares about this issue, has said he would like the House to move quickly with, as he said, an ``all hands on deck effort.'' Good for him. One of his subcommittees, the Health Subcommittee, recently marked up a dozen bills. This happened yesterday; they marked up 12 bills. Look at those bills. A number of them are actually a part of CARA already. They are in CARA. They are smaller bills. None of them is comprehensive, like CARA. One reason we have to get CARA passed is this is a problem that has to be addressed from all angles, from all sectors, and that is why it has to be comprehensive. But of those 12 bills that were marked up yesterday, many of them are identical, and others are very similar to the CARA legislation. So this shouldn't slow us down. In fact, it is even more an indication that if these are the kinds of bills the House thinks are the right way to go, let's get CARA passed and then we can work on the other legislative ideas Members may have. I respect my colleagues--Chairman Upton, the majority leader over there, and Chairman Pence, the chairman of the subcommittee and also a guy who cares a lot about this issue--but let's give CARA a vote. There are 125 cosponsors. That is the latest number I have as of this morning, and the number keeps growing. It is bipartisan, it is bicameral, and it is the right thing to do. Again, I know there are other ideas out there, and that is fine. We need to take those up as well. But let's go ahead and get this passed. Put it under suspension, and take it to the floor. It will pass. We are one vote away from having this help our communities. CARA is not just comprehensive; it does the right thing in terms of focusing on what is evidence based. In other words, we didn't just say ``Let's throw more money at this problem,'' we said ``Let's actually find out what is working and what is not working.'' I was in Dayton, OH, with a group called Project C.U.R.E. on Friday. I had the chance to visit with some of the administrators there, some of the recovery coaches, as they call themselves, many of whom, by the way, are recovering themselves. They are doing an amazing job. I talked to many of the patients who were there. They are people who are recovering addicts. Some have been clean for 2 weeks, some clean for 2 years. But I asked them the same question I ask all over our State: What works? What doesn't work? How did this happen? Most of them, by the way, told me the same story you hear time and again: It started with prescription drugs. In fact, one story was from a man by the name of Anthony. He dropped out of high school at age 14, got into drugs, and made some mistakes in his life, which he readily acknowledges. He ended up in prison. He said he had eight convictions and was in and out of prison, in and out of the drug world. He decided to go straight. [[Page S2365]] He made a decision. For him, a lot of it was faith based and a lot was being sure he was going to be able to take care of his family and be a contributing member of his community, so he gave back. Anthony had a good job, had gotten married, and was on the right track. He was on his way to work one day, and he was in a car accident. For those experts who are listening to this today, you probably know happened. I don't even have to tell you. When he got in the car accident, he was injured. They sent him to the hospital. What did they give him at the hospital? Narcotic pain pills, Percocet, prescription drugs. Immediately--immediately--Anthony became addicted again. He is now struggling, but he is back at the treatment center. He is getting his life back together again. But in the meantime he has lost his family because the drugs became everything. He lost his job because the drugs became everything. We talk a lot about the overdoses, and they are horrible--120 Americans a day. We don't talk enough about those who aren't overdosing but who have lost their ability to achieve their own God-given purpose in life because the drugs are everything. So they have lost their families--torn apart. They have lost their jobs. They have lost their ability to be contributing members of our society. And those people who get into treatment and longer term recovery, as Anthony is doing, can turn their lives around. There is hope. It can work. Anthony is back for a second chance. Having talked to him, I believe he is not just on the right track but he will work through this. This legislation is needed to help him. When I do meet with recovering addicts, I ask them to look at the legislation, look at the summaries, and tell me what they think. What they tell me is they like it because they are convinced it would help others to have the access to treatment they have. Probably only 1 out of 10 of those people who are addicted are getting treatment. That is the best number I have. Maybe it is a little higher than that in your State or congressional district, but this is an issue where, if we provide more resources for treatment and begin to remove that stigma around treatment and get more people into a system where they can begin to get their lives back together with treatment, we know that works. Our legislation supports veterans task forces and veterans courts because we know this will help with our veterans who are coming back with PTSD, 20 percent of whom have this addiction. People say it is self-medicating. They have self-medicated to the point that they are now addicts. We need to put them not into a prison cell but into a treatment program. That is what these veterans courts do, and they surround these veterans with other veterans. They do an awesome job. I have been to them in Ohio. You have them probably in your State. If you don't, this legislation will help because it creates more veterans courts. We have talked on the floor before about the fact that there has been a huge increase--a 750 percent increase in the State of Ohio--in babies born with addiction. That is just in the last 12 years in Ohio. Go to any neonatal unit in your State or congressional district, and you will see these babies. They are being lovingly cared for by doctors and nurses. They are taking these addicted babies you could hold in the palm of your hand, and they are literally taking them through withdrawal. They have to because these babies are addicted and showing the symptoms you might see in an adult of addiction. We don't know what the long-term consequences are. We are having a hearing on this tomorrow in Cleveland, OH, at one of our great hospitals--University Hospitals Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital. It is one of the best children's hospitals in the country. Their neonatal unit is doing awesome work. I have been there and seen it. We are going to talk to the experts about this and how we can do even better to help these babies. But wouldn't it be great if we didn't have so many babies born with addiction because mothers, knowing the consequences, dealt with their addiction problem to avoid it through prevention and education efforts? Wouldn't it be great if we didn't have this 750-percent increase in children whose futures are uncertain because of being born with this addiction? Again, there is hope. I have been to a women's recovery center in Cleveland and Columbus and also in Eastern Ohio and Athens, OH, where I have met with women in long-term recovery with drug addiction. They are there with their kids. There is hope. With this legislation, we do have the ability to give people more hope. Getting rid of that stigma, not judging people, is part of beating this epidemic, and CARA will do that by treating addiction like a disease. There is an opportunity for us to move, and move quickly, to address this growing crisis we have in our States and our communities; that is, to pass this CARA legislation. Is it all we should do? No. Of course we should do more. I know the House of Representatives will have some great ideas. I know there are some great ideas in this body. The HELP Committee is working on additional ideas on how to get more medicine into this area of addiction, science, and treatment. They are working on ways to ensure that we can provide more help to people. That is great, and we should continue to work on that. Meanwhile, we know this legislation will help. We know that if it is sitting on the desk in the House of Representatives, having passed the Senate by a 94-to-1 vote, it is not going to help. But we know if it can get off the desk and onto the floor for a vote, we are one vote away from getting it to our communities to begin to help, to keep people from making the wrong decision--but then if they get into a drug addiction, it can help them to be able to turn their lives around and to achieve their potential in life, their God-given potential. That is what this argument is about. It is not about the fact that the Senate has all the answers. By the way, we wrote this legislation with the House. They were engaged from the start. We introduced identical bills and they had 125 cosponsors. All we are saying is, let's let this one piece of legislation go, let's allow it to begin to help right away, and then let's continue to work on other ideas. Again, we have lost nearly 5,000 Americans to drug overdoses since the Senate passed CARA with a 94-to-1 vote. To begin to reverse this tide--this trend of addiction, of overdoses--we can and should act now. It is urgent. There is a crisis. There is no time to waste. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wish to thank my friend for his comments about addiction. I agree with the Senator from Ohio, talking about the victims from Ohio. I can assure him we have victims in Virginia and all across the country, and we need to get this legislation to the President's desk so people who are hurt by the scourge of drugs can get the treatment they need. Again, I thank him for his leadership. Nomination of Merrick Garland Madam President, I rise to again express my disappointment that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have continued to obstruct consideration of an eminently qualified candidate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. It has now been 36 days since President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland; that is, 36 days that our highest Court has been relegated to falling short of its full constitutional obligations. Make no mistake. The Senate's inaction is already having a tangible impact on the Court's ability to function effectively. During the current session, we have seen our eight current Justices end up in a 4-to-4 deadlock in three separate cases since Justice Scalia's passing--effectively muting the Court's voice in consequential judicial proceedings. President Reagan himself said: ``Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' More recently, retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor put it quite simply, as she always does. She said: ``I think we need somebody there now to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' Indeed, the Supreme Court has granted only three cases since Justice Scalia [[Page S2366]] died--a number experts say is extraordinarily low and an indication that the eight sitting Justices are acutely aware of the precarious position the Court is in with a vacancy. Many Senators apparently believe that President Obama shouldn't be able to make appointments under article II because he is in the last year of his term. The record shows there is nothing in the Constitution that says the President is only President for 3 of the 4 years of his or her term. I don't understand that reasoning. Under that reasoning, any of those same Senators who have made that argument shouldn't be voting on any bill that comes before this body in the last year of their Senate term. If we continue with that rationale, the President's office and the Senate would lead to further dysfunction. Quite honestly, that logic is beyond the pale. It is clear as well that the American people expect us to do our job. Recent polls show that by a 2-to-1 margin Americans want the Senate to hold hearings and vote on Judge Garland's nomination. That is why I remain so perplexed by the logical contortions that many of my colleagues are undertaking to justify their obstruction and quite honestly their failure to do their job. I had the chance to meet with Judge Garland last week. His qualifications and dedication to public service are beyond reproach. He has received strong bipartisan support in the past, but what also stood out to me are his measured view of the role of the judiciary, his strong record on national security, and commitment to keeping our country safe. This past Tuesday marked the 21st anniversary of the bombing of a Federal building in Oklahoma City. On that tragic day in 1995, 168 people, including 19 children, lost their lives. To this day, the Oklahoma City bombing remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in our Nation's history. Judge Garland at that time was Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General. He was the guy who led the criminal investigation and supervised the prosecution of the bombers. Merrick Garland fought for justice for the victims and the families in Oklahoma City. Through his tireless efforts, deep understanding of the law, and attention to detail, he ensured that the prosecution had an airtight case. Ultimately, both bombers were successfully convicted. This is the highest profile instance in which Judge Garland exhibited his commitment to making and keeping our country safe, but it is far from the only one. In my meeting with him, it was clear that the safety and security of our citizens is an issue that quite honestly keeps him up at night. What also stands out about my conversation with Judge Garland is his sense of humility. Our conversation and his judicial record demonstrate to me that he is a moderate, thoughtful, consensus candidate. As Judge Garland said in the Rose Garden on the day he was nominated: People must be confident that a judge's decisions are determined by the law and only the law. For a judge to be worthy of such trust, he or she must be faithful to the Constitution, and to the statutes passed by Congress. He or she must put aside his personal views or preferences and follow the law; not make it. Fidelity to the Constitution and the law has been the cornerstone of my professional life, and is the hallmark of the kind of judge I have tried to be for the past 18 years. These are not the words nor the track record of a judicial activist. In my opinion, this is the kind of judge that Merrick Garland has been: not a judicial activist but someone who recognizes the important role and the important balance between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. I am encouraged that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have at least begun to give Judge Garland the courtesy of a meeting, but meetings alone are not sufficient. The American people deserve the opportunity to hear Judge Garland's qualifications debated in a public hearing in the Judiciary Committee, and they deserve an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. That is all we ask. I again urge my colleagues to give Judge Garland the consideration other nominees have received. At the end of the day, if they choose to vote against him, that is their right, but the idea that somehow they are interpreting the Constitution to say that in the last year of a Presidency a qualified judge should not even receive consideration of a hearing and a vote is quite honestly beyond the pale. Too often these debates end up going on and become extraordinarily complicated. In many ways, what I hear from Virginians--regardless of whether they want me to support Judge Garland--is a very simple message: Do your job. In the coming days and weeks, I hope the Senate will do its job and give Judge Garland the consideration of a hearing before the Judiciary Committee and then take up this eminently qualified jurist's nomination on the floor and give him the vote he deserves. I yield the floor. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Paris Climate Agreement Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to recognize the importance of the signing of the Paris Agreement. Tomorrow marks the 46th anniversary of Earth Day--the first Earth Day--the Earth Day that occurred when I was in seventh grade. My seventh grade teacher made a point of making sure all the students were aware of it. They made sure we had a chance to do a field trip to the community college to learn about some of the issues related to stewardship of the planet. It is a day to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of our blue-green planet but also to recognize, to remind ourselves of the fact that we have a huge responsibility to be good stewards of the wonderful planet we have. It was Theodore Roosevelt who said that ``our greatest central task [is] leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us.'' That is the definition of stewardship, and that is what Earth Day is all about. This is why it is so fitting that tomorrow, on Earth Day, America will join other nations in signing the Paris Agreement. This international climate accord is a tremendous step forward. It makes clear the world recognizes that global warming is a very significant and grave concern facing human civilization on this planet. It is, indeed, the moral challenge of our generation. I am proud and inspired by the global community's unprecedented commitment to avert global warming, to avert a climate crisis. We know what the stakes are. We don't need computer models to look 50 years into the future because the impacts are here today. We see it in our own communities. We see it in our own States. We see it through the impact of droughts, the impact of wildfires, the impact of heat waves, the storms, the hurricanes, the tornadoes. We see it through story after story of this year or this month being the warmest ever recorded by humans. These events have profound costs that can be measured in lost lives, lost homes, lost businesses, billions of dollars in disaster relief. It is important to understand that global warming's major assault is on our rural communities, on our farming, our fishing, and our forestry. You can see it across the world. You can see it across the country. You can see it just inside my home State of Oregon. We have had significant droughts greatly impacting our agricultural community in my State. We have had a loss of snowpack in the Cascades, a trend over decades impacting the availability of water for irrigation in farming. We have seen the impact on fishing, with streams that are warmer and smaller than they were in the past. We have seen it on our oyster population on the coast, where now the oysters are having trouble reproducing because the Pacific Ocean is 30 percent more acidic than it was before we started burning fossil fuels on this planet. That greater acidity is affecting the ability of baby oysters to form shells. That should frighten us all--the ability of shellfish to form shells being threatened. It is hard to imagine that we have burned enough fossil fuels to actually [[Page S2367]] impact the acidity of the oceans. But we have, and the problem is getting worse. We see the impact on our forests. We see it in my home State of Oregon through the red zone. That is the term given to the vast swaths of forests that have been killed by pine beetles because the winters now are not cold enough to kill off the pine beetle. So the infestations are much more aggressive, much more widespread. We see the impact on our forests from more vigorous wildfires and a longer forest fire season--a season that has grown by 60 days over 40 years. That is 2 months. In fact, we have even had forest fires in Oregon in the month of January. It is a huge loss, a huge impact on the ecosystem, and a huge impact on the economy. If you care about rural America and our farming, our fishing, and our forestry, you must care about carbon pollution and global warming. Scientists agree that we must keep the warming of our planet under 2 degrees Celsius in order to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change--impacts much worse than what we are seeing now. But we have already warmed the planet by 1 degree. So we are halfway toward that boundary, which is why an important component of the Paris agreement is not just the substance of the agreement itself but also a compact that the international community will revisit every 5 years, because the measures taken in the Paris agreement are not enough to fend off catastrophe. What they do represent is virtually every nation in the world coming together and saying we understand the challenge to our planet, and we understand that we must be part of the solution. To have more heads of state come together in December for the Paris agreement than at any other time in human history is very impressive. But the commitments made, even if they are fully fulfilled, don't go far enough. We are going to have to come back together every 5 years to add to our understanding and to increase the speed with which we are pivoting from fossil fuels to renewable fuels. At those 5-year gatherings, we will strengthen our pledges, we will work to reduce the emissions even further, and we will review the changing technologies. There is so much investment going on. There is a program called Mission Innovation, which is a number of countries coming together, private companies coming together, and foundations coming together to develop the best ideas--out-of-the-box ideas--to be able to take on the challenge of global warming. Those technologies are going to be a key part of accelerating our ability to tackle this challenge. We have to keep working to drive down the cost curve on renewable energy so that it makes a positive contribution to our economy in every possible way, lowering the cost of power while at the same time putting thousands or, in some technologies, millions of individuals to work. We have to make sure developing countries can afford these options in solar, wind, and other renewable strategies. Together, we must invest in paradigm-shifting technology. One of those might be battery storage, to make better use of solar energy when the solar energy exceeds current demand, or to capture wind energy when the wind is blowing strongly and our wind turbines are producing more than the current demand. It means we have to do things such as investing in a broader grid to ship those amps of electricity around the country--those watts of energy around the country. Here at home, we can't keep up business as usual. If we need to pivot from fossil fuels to renewables, then we shouldn't keep subsidizing fossil fuels. We can't keep drilling oil offshore and opening up drilling in new places like the Arctic. The Arctic nation should come together and reach a pact not to drill in the Arctic and to put it off-limits. As American citizens, you and I own a lot of oil, a lot of coal, and we must recognize that we need to keep those fossil fuels that we own in the ground because here is the size of the problem. For us to succeed in keeping the temperature of our planet below 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial age, we have to leave 80 percent of the identified proven fossil fuel reserves in the world in the ground. If we are going to do that, then it makes no sense at all--for what you and I own as citizens--to be pulling it out of the ground. It makes no sense to be doing contracts today--leases--that provide a legal contract for extraction of our coal, our oil, and our gas, which you and I own as citizens, three decades, four decades, or five decades into the future--long after the world has to have pivoted off of fossil fuels. It is said that when you are in a hole, stop digging. In this case, we are in a carbon pollution hole, and we need to stop digging fossil fuels out of the ground. Instead, we must seize the opportunity to invest in the infrastructure of the future, to spur a clean energy revolution, and to build a green economy creating living-wage jobs. It has been said that we are the first generation to feel the impact of global warming, and we are the last generation that can do something about it. That is a huge responsibility. The signing of this agreement consists of doing something about it, something major about it, something important about it, something that all the Nations in the world have come together to do together to take this on and to recognize our collective responsibility. It is a breakthrough moment in the fight-- the international fight, the human civilization fight--to take on this moral, major challenge to our planet. While this deal is by no means the end of the work we must do, having the global community come together around a vision of action is a huge milestone in the path to averting climate catastrophe. This agreement should only strengthen our Nation's resolve to build a sustainable future, to protect our beautiful blue-green planet, and to work harder to fight climate change not just on Earth Day but every day of the year. In fact, this agreement is very much central to the task that Theodore Roosevelt put before us: to leave our land a better land for our descendants than it is for us. Let's get to work. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3833 to Amendment No. 3801 Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3833. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Minnesota, [Mr. Franken] proposes an amendment numbered 3833 to amendment No. 3801. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To provide funding for the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program) On page 29, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following: Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program For the cost of loan guarantees provided under section 2602(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (25 U.S.C. 3502(c)), $8,500,000, to remain available until expended: Provided, That the cost of those loan guarantees (including the costs of modifying loans, as applicable) shall be determined in accordance with section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 661a): Provided further, That, for necessary administrative expenses to carry out that program, $500,000 is appropriated, to remain available until expended: Provided further, That, of the subsidy amounts provided by section 1425 of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (Public Law 112-10; 125 Stat. 126), for the cost of loan guarantees for renewable energy or efficient end-use energy technologies under section 1703 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16513), $9,000,000 is permanently canceled. Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, Federal programs in Indian Country are chronically underfunded. I have served on the Indian Affairs Committee for the past 7 years, and I have been shocked by what I hear almost every week from tribal leaders about the challenges in Indian Country. Tribes struggle with crumbling schools, dilapidated roads, lack of housing, and lack of basic infrastructure. Many of the crises we hear about in Indian Country come from lack of opportunity, lack of hope. Indian youth have the highest rate of suicide among all ethnic groups in the United States. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for Native youth aged 15 to 24. The Indian suicide rate is 62 percent higher than it is for [[Page S2368]] the general population. Unemployment on Indian reservations averages 19 percent, and on some reservations it is above 50 percent. Senators Murkowski, Heitkamp, and Udall understand the dire needs of Indian Country, which is why they have cosponsored my amendment. Chairman Barrasso also understands the needs of Indian Country, and that is why he also supports this amendment. They understand that we have to support economic development for tribes whenever we can. My amendment sets aside $9 million, which can be leveraged into about $50 to $85 million worth of loans for energy projects in Indian Country. Developing tribal energy resources will help tribes bring power to the most remote parts of Indian Country--improving access to reliable and resilient energy and providing much needed jobs. That is why Congress authorized the loan program in the Energy Policy Act of 2005--to help tribes access the capital they need for energy projects. But this program has never received funding. My amendment doesn't cost anything. We are simply putting $9 million of already-appropriated money toward a new use. I thank Senators Heitkamp, Udall, and Murkowski for cosponsoring my amendment. I thank Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Feinstein for their leadership. Finally, I thank Secretary Moniz, who has been a champion for this program. I urge my colleagues to support Franken amendment No. 3833 to bring jobs to Indian Country. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank Senator Franken for the way he worked with our committee. I will vote for the amendment, and I recommend that others do as well. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3833. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced---yeas 76, nays 19, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 59 Leg.] YEAS---76 Alexander Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Crapo Daines Donnelly Enzi Feinstein Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Kaine King Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill Menendez Merkley Mikulski Moran Murkowski Murray Nelson Peters Reed Reid Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Toomey Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS---19 Ayotte Boozman Cotton Ernst Fischer Johnson Kirk Lankford Lee McConnell Paul Perdue Portman Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Tillis Vitter NOT VOTING---5 Blunt Cruz Durbin Murphy Sanders The amendment (No. 3833) was agreed to. vote explanation Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from this afternoon's vote on Franken amendment No. 3833, which was adopted to the pending business--Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, H.R. 2028. On rollcall vote No. 59, had I been present, I would have voted to support the amendment. Senator Franken's amendment will further strengthen the deployment of clean energy by creating a Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program to fund energy projects in Indian Country. This amendment will help Indian tribes access much needed financing as they seek to develop energy projects and create well-paying jobs. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee to express my appreciation to the majority leader of the Senate, Senator McConnell, and Senator Cochran, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, for moving the process forward. We have on the floor today the Energy and Water Committee bill. This is the first bill of the Appropriations Committee to come to the floor. It signals that we are ready to do regular order. I so appreciate the leaderships' commitment to do that, so we don't end up with a big omnibus bill at the end. Every bill comes, they can be amended, and everyone can have their day and their say. It is an excellent kickoff to what I hope will be the ability to move all 12 bills and some crucial, urgent supplementals. I also compliment Senators Alexander and Senator Feinstein for the excellent job they have done on this particular subcommittee. They have followed the bipartisan agreement. They have a bill that is free of poison pill riders. When you look at what they have done in terms of energy and water, it is an excellent bill from the standpoint of national security and economic development, whether it is the funding for the Army Corps of Engineers that is so important to those of us who have ports, to science in terms of our fields of energy. We win Nobel prizes, but we need to win the markets. It has an excellent approach in terms of tech transfer. Maryland benefits from this bill. It provides over $100 million for the Port of Baltimore. That is going to support the port's nearly 14,000 jobs and a tax base of over $300 million. The Port of Baltimore has always been the gateway to Ohio and the West. First, supported by the B&O--Baltimore and Ohio--Railroad and now CSX. Funding in this bill dredges the port's 50-foot channel, making it ready for megacontainer ships coming through the expanded Panama Canal and supporting the port's competitive edge over its East Coast competition. The bill also funds construction of Poplar Island, where clean dredge material is rebuilding the natural ecosystem of a former Chesapeake Bay island. This bill exceeds the target level for the harbor maintenance trust fund, providing approximately $1.3 billion. Dredging is the primary activity of the trust fund. This funding is knocking out the nationwide backlog of dredging projects, supporting the U.S. economy and local economies. Across Maryland, this bill makes critical investments, protecting Assateague Island, a national seaside treasure, for future generations, protecting Cumberland from flooding, and protecting this area's water supply at the Jennings Randolph Lake in Garrett County. This bill also supports a unique public-private partnership between the U.S. Department of Energy and commercial truck manufacturers. Together, they are developing the next generation of fuel-efficient heavy-duty trucks. Total funding is $20 million. Volvo has been a partner and is competing again for a portion of this funding. Its Hagerstown, MD plant produces Mack Trucks with 1,600 jobs. Their talented professionals have been leaders on truck engine research and development, discovering technologies to reduce oil consumption and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. For the Appalachian Regional Commission, this bill provides $75 million for the base program, an increase of $5 million. The commission meets both physical and human infrastructure needs. This is a hands- across-the-aisle program that all Appalachia Senators support. There are 13 States in the commission. [[Page S2369]] Maryland has three counties in the commission: Washington, Allegany, and Garrett. Maryland's mountain counties receive nearly $5 million annually, making investments to rebound from lost manufacturing jobs. The recession was another setback. Now, through their community colleges, they are retraining and retooling their residents. The commission's grants, matched with local and other Federal funding, are making a big difference. I recently visited Garrett College where I announced two grants. The first was to establish new allied health programs with a simulation manikin. This was a grant award for $110,000. The second grant was to buy Westernport a new water tank. This grant for $400,000 was matched with $2.4 million in other Federal loans and grants. It means more capacity for Westernport, new service to nearby towns of Luke and Bloomington, and a huge cost savings to Luke Mill. The paper mill has been supplying drinking water to the town of Luke. This grant is protecting the 880 employees at Luke Mill and 3,000 regional jobs in timber and trucking. If this is the way it is going to be to move appropriations, I think it is a good day. It is not only a good bill, but it shows when the Senate practices the ability to work together to bring legislation to the floor, to follow regular order, we can get our job done. It can be open, it can be transparent, and we can have amendments. I so look forward to this being the tone and the tempo of the rest of the appropriations season. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas. National Park Week Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, this week I encourage Arkansans and all Americans to take a moment and enjoy your local national parks as we celebrate National Park Week 2016. This year National Park Week is particularly important because it also happens to be the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service, a milestone we will celebrate all year long. For those of you who don't know, our National Park System began in 1872 with the establishment of Yellowstone National Park. The organization charged with managing these parks, the National Park Service, was established four decades later in 1916. Today we have over 400 national parks and historic sites around the country, all full of wildlife, beautiful landscapes, and rich culture. These sites are all cared for by over 20,000 dedicated employees of the National Park Service, including park rangers who patrol our parks and keep visitors safe. Arkansas is home to several national parks and national historic sites, some of the prettiest and most interesting in the country, in my opinion. For those of you who have not been to Arkansas, I encourage you to visit Hot Springs National Park to see our natural springs and thermal pools. If you are a history buff, you can visit Arkansas Post, the site of the only Revolutionary War activity in the State of Arkansas. If you are into the outdoors, you can float the Buffalo River. The list goes on. Each of the national parks and historic sites in Arkansas and around the country has its own unique appeal and holds its own adventure. So happy National Park Week and happy 100th birthday to the National Park Service. I encourage everyone to take advantage of free admission to all national parks in Arkansas and across the country through this Sunday, April 24. Have a little fun, learn a little bit about your great country, and show your support and thanks for the men and women who serve us in the national parks. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to complete this speech. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Corporate Inversions Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, over the past couple of years I have spoken numerous times on corporate inversions, the problems they cause, and various proposed solutions. I wish to take a few minutes today to comment on some of the recent developments with regard to this important issue. Inversions are a matter of great concern in our country. This is true among members of both parties, both in and out of government. As the chairman of the Senate's tax-writing committee, I have to say that for years now, most major discussions I have had on tax policy and reform with various private sector stakeholders eventually end up focusing on inversions. Virtually everyone acknowledges that inversions are a problem. When a U.S. company reidentifies itself as a foreign entity and moves its tax headquarters overseas, it shrinks our tax base. It means lost investment and growth for our country and a further demonstration of the failure of the government to create a tax environment in this country that allows businesses to flourish, create jobs, and, of course, help grow our economy. As I said, members of both parties see inversions as a problem, one that needs fixing. Sadly, the debate surrounding this national issue has too often become mired in politics and partisanship, which thus far has prevented Congress from making any real progress. Some in Washington--in the Capitol and on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue--would rather talk about inversions than solve the problem. When a wave of U.S. companies announce that they are merging with other entities and moving their headquarters offshore, the strategy seems to be to publicly attack those companies; accuse them of, among other things, lacking ``economic patriotism''; and put forward unworkable policy proposals while labelling anyone opposing those proposals as somehow being in favor of or at least indifferent to inversions. Most of the policy ideas that get put forward tend to be punitive and burdensome, with the goal, not of incentivizing companies to stay in the United States, but to forcibly prevent them from leaving. Over the past year or so of political campaigning, we have heard a lot of talk about building walls and who will be made to pay for them. Some are proposing that we build a literal physical wall to keep certain people from coming into the United States, with a supposedly clever plan to force other countries to pay for it. Well, at the same time, most of the proposals we have seen to deal with inversions would amount to building a virtual wall--a wall forged in regulation and punitive tax treatment--around the country to keep companies from leaving and making every business in America and all of their employees and individual customers pay the cost. The latest wall-building exercise came earlier this month with Treasury's temporary anti-inversion regulations and proposed regulations aimed at earnings stripping. Of course, the administration's anti-inversion approach is essentially the regulatory equivalent of a doctor who wastes all of his time and energy treating a patient's symptoms one by one as they arise without making any effort to diagnose, let alone treat, the underlying illness. Inversions are not in and of themselves a disease; they are merely symptoms of a much broader illness that will continue to infect our economy so long as we refuse to treat it. I won't keep you in suspense, Mr. President. That illness is not a lack of proper regulation; it is an overly burdensome tax system and an environment that is, on the whole, unfriendly to American businesses. U.S. companies don't move their tax headquarters offshore because they like the weather in other countries. If that were the case, I don't think so many of them would be moving to Ireland or the U.K. No. American companies invert because they face global competition, and our system forces them to compete on an uneven playing field with at least one, if not both arms tied behind their back. For example, we have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, and we have a tax code that effectively pays U.S. [[Page S2370]] multinationals to keep their foreign earnings offshore and punishes them when they decide to bring capital back into the country. It is these factors--not a lack of appropriate regulation by the government or a shortage of ``economic patriotism'' on the part of American businesses--that make foreign countries more attractive destinations for American companies. If we want to prevent future inversions, we should spend less time tinkering around the regulatory edges and engaging in partisan rhetoric and more time trying to find common ground to actually fix our Tax Code. For the record, it isn't just inversions that are the problem. As I have noted repeatedly, even if the administration and Congress found a way, through punitive and burdensome means, to block all inversions, our tax system would still make American companies even more attractive targets for foreign takeovers, which are every bit as problematic as inversions, if not more so, and much harder to address through a purely regulatory approach. Foreign takeovers are already a problem. According to an Ernst and Young study released last year, the U.S. economy suffered a net loss of $179 billion--with a ``b''--in business and assets to foreign buyers in the decade between 2003 and 2013. The same study also found that a reduced corporate tax rate would have greatly reduced these losses, possibly eliminating them entirely. Keep in mind that unlike most inversion transactions, U.S. management is almost always fired after a foreign takeover. Other employees--local service providers and suppliers--are often targeted for elimination as well. Sadly, many Democrats in Washington, both here in Congress and in the administration, don't seem to grasp the full nature of this problem. They talk a great deal about inversions and the need to prevent them. Because the picture of a big American company moving offshore to escape taxation is particularly distressing for populist audiences, they tend to ramp up that talk and couple it with ideas on how to punish inverters in even-numbered years. Yet they have taken precious little action to fix the underlying problems that lead companies to want to invert in the first place. There was a glimmer of hope with the findings and recommendations of the Finance Committee's bipartisan International Tax Reform Working Group. However, as is far too often the case, that glimmer of hope may very well be overtaken by the politics of the moment. So instead of acknowledging that our tax system is the cause of the inversion problem, my friends on the other side have generally opted to put forward regulations that may very well be effective in curbing inversions in the short term but will do nothing to improve business conditions in the United States and could be in the order of causing companies to sell themselves to foreign buyers, which is what is happening. Within days of the release of the Treasury's latest regulations, Pfizer, a major American drug company, announced it was backing out of its proposed inversion deal with Allergan. Many observers were quick to credit the Obama administration for a supposed job well done while Democratic candidates for President openly celebrated the fact that an American company chose to subject itself to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and penalties in order to avoid even greater losses as a result of these regulations. That is the kind of world we are living in--one where there is a willingness to demonize an iconic American company that employees tens of thousands of American workers and to cheer when it suffers massive losses. That is viewed as an affirmative qualification to be the Democratic nominee for President. Now, to be fair, I will acknowledge that, in addition to unveiling the proposed anti-inversion measures, the Obama administration also laid out a basic framework for corporate tax reform. Of course, this framework, which closely resembles similar proposals the President has included in past budgets, is woefully short on details. It is not a reform proposal with any serious potential for bipartisanship nor one with a detailed list of specific goals and objectives. It is more or less just a vaguely worded wish list of tax ideas they would like to see enacted at some point. The reaction from many sectors of the business community, including from CEOs who more often than not support my friends on the other side, proves the point. We know, basically, that the President's version of international tax reform consists of a one-time mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings to be taxed at a rate designed not to maximize any benefit but to hit a revenue target for increased spending--in other words, so they can spend more money. This would be coupled with a high minimum tax on foreign earnings, also designed specifically for increased spending, not for significantly bringing down the statutory tax rate, which, after all, is one of the few ways you can really help our American companies. Put simply, there is virtually nothing in the President's nebulous tax reform framework that would discourage companies from moving offshore. In fact, one could argue--and many have--that the President's proposed high minimum tax on foreign earnings would actually encourage more U.S. companies to invert. For example, this past November, the vice president of global taxes at Procter & Gamble, another iconic American company, was quoted as saying: ``If we take a step towards a [minimum] tax at the corporate level, we're exacerbating the problem; we're actually guaranteeing that inversions are more attractive.'' On top of these new taxes, there is no real effort in the President's tax framework to improve the business climate in the United States more generally. After all these changes, the framework would still leave the United States with a corporate tax that would be well above the average in the developed world, leaving us right where we have been. In short, this framework is par for the course with this administration. We have heard quite a bit of blame thrown in Congress's direction for not acting to prevent inversions. What we haven't heard is any serious effort on the part of the President or anyone in his administration to engage with Congress on meaningful tax reform. Like I said, the President and his supporters are far more willing to assign blame for the problems caused by our tax system than to actually work toward a solution. This is particularly true in election years, when the motto seems to be this: Why fix a problem when you can blame it on the other side? For my part, I am working to take specific steps to address these problems. I have been the Republican leader on the Senate Committee on Finance for about 4\1/2\ years now, and for 4\1/2\ years I have been calling on my colleagues and imploring officials in the administration to engage on tax reform. To date, I have seen little in the way of a meaningful response. Currently, I am working on a relatively simple but potentially effective tax reform proposal that I believe will be bipartisan and many believe would relieve a great deal of the inversion pressure on American companies and, at the very least, significantly alter the economic calculation for inversion transactions. Best of all, it would do so without punishing companies or imposing burdensome mandates. In short, my proposal would provide more carrots to keep companies from inverting and fewer sticks to punish companies that try to go in that direction. While I am still working with the Joint Committee on Taxation to finalize the details of this proposal, the basic idea behind my proposal would be to streamline the taxation of business income and eliminate instances in which profits and earnings are subject to multiple layers of taxation at the company and shareholder levels. I will have more to say on this proposal in the coming weeks. Today, I am simply trying to counter the narrative that American companies can and should be forced to remain in the United States by regulation. I am trying to demonstrate that you cannot fix the inversion problem by building a virtual wall around the country to keep businesses from leaving, while at the same time keeping tax rates so high that they have to leave to be able to compete. I am trying to show why you can't build that wall expecting some other [[Page S2371]] country to pay for it. Indeed, if an anti-inversion wall goes up without any real changes to improve the tax and business environment in the United States, it will be American workers and consumers that will end up footing the bill. What we are working on is corporate integration. Right now the work we have done seems to be getting some positive feedback from the Joint Taxation Committee, but they are not through with their work yet and so we are going to wait until they are. They should be through by the end of May, or at least that is what they have indicated will be their target. Hopefully, they will have some preliminary results before the end of May. But let me say, if we are right on corporate integration, then both parties should come together to resolve these problems so that we can compete with any company anywhere in the world. I can just say, in short, that this program we are devising will allow the companies themselves to bring down their own tax rates without worrying about what the wonderful Members of Congress are going to do. At the same time, by bringing down those rates, they will be able to help this economy to go forward. So far this has been revenue positive. All we want for this program is to be revenue neutral. But I think we can get there, and I hope my friends on the other side will seriously look at this because this is something we could do this year to help this country resolve its problems with regard to corporate inversions. I believe it will work. I believe it will work. But a lot will depend on the Joint Taxation Committee, and we will see what they are doing. So far the work they have done is positive. They have worked on it for a number of months now. They want to cover every possible ramification, and we are very appreciative of the work they are doing. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I filed two amendments very important to my home State of Florida that I want to discuss. The first is an amendment that would authorize the Central Everglades Planning Project. The Florida Everglades are a national treasure. We have to work together to restore these lands. The State has experienced a wetter-than-average winter. The rains have elevated the levels of Lake Okeechobee which triggered the Army Corps of Engineers to discharge billions of gallons of water to the east through the St. Lucie River and to the west through the Caloosahatchee River. These discharges have been ongoing for months and have negatively impacted the delicate ecosystem in the area as well as the agricultural and tourism industries. In order to diminish these discharges, we must authorize the Central Everglades Planning Project. Once complete, this project will allow water to flow south from Lake Okeechobee to Everglades National Park and to Florida Bay. I had hoped this project would be authorized in 2014 by the administration, but the administration delayed the Army Corps of Engineers' Chief's report, which is the final step before Congress can authorize new projects, but this year we have a real chance to get this done. Thanks to the good work of Chairman Inhofe of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I expect the Central Everglades Planning Project to be included in the forthcoming water bill, which is slated to be marked up in committee next week. I will not ask for a vote on this amendment today, but I want to draw attention to this essential Everglades restoration project. I am hopeful this body can come together to restore our Everglades, but in the meantime I will continue to push for this vital authorization. Mr. President, the other amendment I filed today, cosponsored by Senators Shelby, Nelson, and Sessions, also highlights the importance of water management. The issue at hand there involves water that is naturally supposed to flow south, but it has not done so due to the Army Corps' actions in and around the State of Georgia. The results of this mismanagement have led to a 2013 Department of Commerce fishery disaster. It was declared for oysters in the Apalachicola Bay. During that same year, Senator Nelson and I held a field hearing in Apalachicola, where we heard from local fishermen whose livelihoods and family traditions were injured by the collapse of these fisheries. While we must continue to explore ways to fish more sustainably, a large part of the fisheries' collapse was the lack of freshwater flows. I have long supported the role Governors play in water allocation when the water in question greatly impacts multiple States. However, absent such an agreement between Governors, water continues to be withheld, and the situation has now become dire in my home State of Florida. The bottom line is, the status quo is only working for one State. I, along with the senior Senator from Florida and our colleagues from Alabama, have stood lockstep to bring our respective States to the table to finalize water allocations that will take into account our shared goals. Today we filed an amendment to do just that--to require the Governors to agree on water allocation before the Army Corps of Engineers can reallocate waters between the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin. The amendment also stipulates no funds would be available for reallocation of water within the States if an agreement between the Governors is not finalized. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure. Eureka Gardens Mr. President, on a different matter, I want to take this moment to applaud the residents of Eureka Garden Apartments in Jacksonville, FL, for coming together as a community during a time of hardship. While they face dangerous living conditions and bureaucratic indifference to their concerns, they have remained united and resilient. The bottom line is, the Federal Government has failed them. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has for years certified a living facility that has put hundreds of families at risk. When HUD inspected the property in question last summer, they passed the apartment complex, and they passed it with flying colors. Eureka Gardens received an 85 out of 100, but less than a month later, residents were complaining at tenants' association meetings and to their city council members about how bad their living conditions had become. When my staff visited the complex, what they witnessed was literally unbelievable. They saw crumbling stairs and black mold. They saw exposed electrical wiring that had been covered up by a trash bag. They smelled the natural gas that would soon hospitalize residents just days later. That was and that is unacceptable. My office, along with Mayor Curry of the city of Jacksonville and the city council and the tenants association, pushed for months to have improvements and repairs done to this complex. In February, HUD finally had a date by which all repairs must be completed. When they came back to reinspect Eureka Gardens, it passed the inspection, and they eventually renewed their contract with the property's owner, but the residents continued to say what they have been saying all along--HUD's inspections weren't working. Just recently, HUD revealed that Eureka Gardens passed with a score of 62. The passing score is a 60. However, a senior HUD official admitted that HUD officials do not believe the property would currently pass another inspection. So HUD has just admitted it has certified a failing facility. Something is clearly wrong with the HUD inspection process and Floridians are being hurt because of it. I would like to read part of an article from the Florida Times-Union, which was published on Monday that quotes one of the residents at Eureka Gardens. Dwan Wilson, who said she has had to go to the hospital at least six times with asthma issues since the mold remediation, cried as she spoke about her apartments' problems. [[Page S2372]] ``We thank you all for what you're trying to do,'' Wilson said. ``We thank you all for pushing. But we're telling you they aren't doing anything.'' How many more years must the residents of Eureka Gardens suffer under this mismanagement? How many more children have to be put at risk due to lead poisoning and gas leaks? How many more facilities will HUD continue to rubberstamp approval of only to further sell slumlike conditions for the most vulnerable tenants? How many taxpayer dollars will be wasted by this agency on failing projects such as this? These are the questions HUD must answer. In the meantime, the residents of Eureka Gardens are forced to deal with the consequences of HUD's failures. I will continue to look for solutions to make sure what has happened at Eureka Gardens isn't repeated elsewhere. Americans deserve better from their government. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter I wrote to the Secretary of HUD, and it is dated April 18. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Senate, Washington, DC, April 18, 2016. Hon. Secretary Julian Castro, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, DC. Dear Secretary Castro: For over five months, my office has been involved in the investigation of shocking health and safety conditions at Eureka Garden Apartments (Eureka Garden) in Jacksonville, Florida. It is appalling that American taxpayer dollars have been wastefully spent over the years to fund a facility that has repeatedly put hundreds of people and their families at risk. I am writing to highlight these many problems and to ask for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to conduct a thorough review of its inspection process. As you may know, following reports of code violations at the Westside complex, my Jacksonville staff toured Eureka Garden in early October 2015. They witnessed crumbling stairs disguised with duct-tape and covered with apparent black mold, faulty electric wiring covered with a garbage bag, and a distinguishable natural gas odor being sucked from an outdoor piping system into residents' air-conditioning, among other obvious health and safety issues. HUD confirmed these conditions in an inspection of the property in October 2015, in which physical deficiencies were found in at least 340 of the 400 units. According to HUD's own criteria, almost 50 of those deficiencies represented ``Exigent Health and Safety concerns,'' including mold, water damage, exposed wires, carbon monoxide hazards and leaking gas pipes. Despite these findings, just three months earlier in July 2015, HUD gave Eureka Garden Apartments an 85 out of 100 score in its Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) inspection. Although many of the problems were witnessed during the summer inspection, HUD representatives defended the passing score to my staff in a meeting last October, saying they did not contribute to the assessment of the property as they are not relevant criteria under HUD's inspection process. Had it not been for the residents calling attention to their dire situation, the facility would not have been reviewed again for another two years. Your Department recently notified my office that the most recent inspection of Eureka Garden gave the complex a REAC score of 62 out 100, despite the many repairs that have been completed since the last REAC inspection. This discrepancy indicates something is clearly wrong with the REAC scores. Your Department visited Eureka Garden again on March 17th and 18th and witnessed what my staff and the city of Jacksonville has seen all along--Eureka Garden remains in poor condition. After visiting Eureka Garden most recently, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing wrote in a letter that ``HUD officials do not believe the property would currently pass another REAC inspection.'' However, HUD's protocol has placed enough confidence in the previous inspection that it has renewed GMF's $6 million contract for Eureka Garden. In doing so, HUD has knowingly certified a substandard facility because of a faulty inspection process. Your Department is ultimately responsible as the steward of the taxpayer funding that supports this property. Therefore, to address these concerns, I respectfully request a timely response to the following questions: With conditions at Eureka Garden going unidentified for so long, what does HUD plan to do about reforming its inspection process to identify problems earlier and to ensure passing grades are not given to failing properties? Will HUD explore a broader reform of inspection that expands the role of and resources available for state and local partners to regularly check the status of HUD-certified facilities to ensure greater accountability? Does the Department plan a re-inspection of the complex? During this difficult time, I am proud of the Eureka Garden community for standing up and coming together on behalf of their vulnerable neighbors. This community has demonstrated great strength by collectively voicing their concerns and showing resiliency in the face of bureaucratic indifference and property mismanagement. It is time they are given the respect and quality of life they so deserve after waiting far too long for critical improvements to be made at Eureka Garden. Thank you for your attention to this matter and continued work on this issue. I look forward to your prompt response. Sincerely, Marco Rubio, U.S. Senator. Calling for the Release of Raif Badawi and Waleed Abulkhair Mr. President, one last item I want to discuss today, and I think it is appropriate, given where the President finds himself at this moment in Saudi Arabia. It is regarding a letter I sent earlier this week, along with Senators Durbin, Risch, Leahy, and Johnson to President Obama asking him to raise human rights issues during his meetings in Saudi Arabia--in particular, the case of Raif Badawi and his lawyer Waleed Abulkhair. Raif Badawi is a Saudi blogger. He was arrested in 2012 on the charge of insulting Islam and indicted on several charges, including apostasy. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes. In January of 2015, Raif received his first set of 50 lashes in public. This resulted in an international outcry. Raif's subsequent lashes have been postponed. They have been postponed on health grounds. They have been postponed because just the first 50 lashes were so brutal, there were doubts whether he would survive 50 more, but he continues to serve his sentence in prison. Last week I met with Raif's wife to discuss his case. Raif and his lawyer should be immediately and unconditionally released. While I deeply value and think it is a very important alliance between the United States and Saudi Arabia, this alliance cannot allow our country to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses. I hope we will take up this cause. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record our letter, dated April 19, 2016, that we wrote to the President. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Senate, Washington, DC, April 19, 2016. Hon. Barack Obama, The President, The White House Washington, DC. Dear Mr. President: As you prepare for your upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia, we are writing to express concern regarding the Government of Saudi Arabia's continued treatment of human rights advocates, particularly the documented prosecutions of non-violent activists who are engaging in freedom of expression. Intolerance for freedom of speech and the imposition of travel bans and lengthy prison terms for peaceful dissidents harm Saudi Arabia's reputation internationally and stifle Saudi innovation and creativity. We are concerned that unless you make these issues a priority during your trip, human rights abuses will continue to occur with impunity and the full potential of the U.S.-Saudi relationship will continue to be impeded. Specifically, we request you raise the case of blogger Raif Badawi, who was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes for launching a website that suggested a peaceful discussion about religion. Mr. Badawi endured a first round of 50 lashes in January of 2015 but the remainder of his lashes has been postponed due to his health condition. During his unjust imprisonment, Mr. Badawi has been a recipient of prestigious international awards such as the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. We are also concerned for the case of Mr. Badawi's lawyer, prominent human rights activist Waleed Abu al-Khair, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Additionally, we are concerned about the 2014 travel ban placed on Mr. Badawi's sister Samar Badawi, for her activism defending human rights. In 2012, Ms. Badawi received the U.S. State Department's International Women of Courage Award. In recent months, Ms. Badawi has been called in for questioning by security forces on several occasions and is subject to ongoing harassment. In your meeting with King Salman, we urge you to advocate for the immediate and unconditional release of Raif Badawi and Waleed Abu al-Khair. Additionally, we urge you to request that Ms. Badawi's travel ban be lifted and ensure that she is not harassed further for her work. This is an important time for Saudi Arabia to play a leadership role in the region and the world by setting an example of religious tolerance and civility. We value the United States and Saudi Arabia close partnership and support efforts to [[Page S2373]] find common approaches to addressing such critical issues as combating terrorism. However, true partners need to be able to have a frank dialogue about disagreements and areas of concern in our relationship. It is thus essential that the United States does not turn a blind eye to Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses. Sincerely, Marco Rubio. James E. Risch. Ron Johnson. Richard J. Durbin. Patrick Leahy. Mr. RUBIO. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Energy Policy Modernization Bill Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the bipartisan Energy Policy Modernization Act, which passed the Senate yesterday with my strong support. This bill will help improve the energy efficiency of our buildings and appliances, saving Michiganders money on their heating and electric bills by incentivizing weatherization and other activities. Many of these cutting-edge building efficiency technologies, such as insulation and window sealing, are designed and developed in my great State of Michigan. The bill also included a number of conservation provisions that will not only protect our environment, but they will boost our economy by supporting the $646 billion outdoor recreation industry. Permanent authorizations of the Land and Water Conservation Fund and reauthorization of the North American Wetland Conservation Act are just two examples that will protect wildlife habitat and improve access to public lands for all kinds of outdoor recreation. Mr. President, I would also like to take a moment to focus on a bipartisan provision that I authored with my colleagues Senator Stabenow and Senator Alexander, the Vehicle Innovation Act. This legislation will provide the tools that researchers, engineers, manufacturers, and others need to create the next generation of cars and trucks built in Michigan and in States all across our country. Southeast Michigan is home to more engineers per capita than anywhere else in the country. We must ensure that our automakers, part suppliers, and other advanced manufacturers have the right tools to develop and incorporate new vehicle innovations that will improve safety, innovation, and vehicle performance in the cars and trucks of the future. Exciting innovations are already underway. Cars and trucks are being made with high-strength, light-weight materials that can improve fuel economy without compromising safety. Improved combustion technologies can increase the efficiency of traditional engines while decreasing emissions. Researchers are making batteries more affordable and recyclable while enhancing battery range and performance, making hybrids and electric vehicles even more competitive. The Department of Energy's Vehicle Technologies Program is leading this effort, working with a wide range of partners, manufacturers, material suppliers, universities, energy suppliers, and our National Laboratories. The Department of Energy's vehicle technology activities are authorized by a patchwork of different laws, and these authorities were last renewed almost a decade ago. A lot has changed in that time. Vehicles today are wired with cutting-edge electronics and sensors. While my favorite part of Detroit cars and trucks remains horsepower and torque, advances in onboard computers and new technologies are making our cars safer, more efficient, and more competitive globally. The Peters-Alexander-Stabenow Vehicle Innovation Act provides for a steady increase in funding for critical DOE programs through the year 2020. This will create more certainty for companies and entrepreneurs engaged in public-private partnerships and ensure that critical research and development can keep up as technologies continue to emerge. Our bill also establishes a clean authorization for DOE's advanced vehicle technology activities. This will improve collaboration with light-duty automobile and medium- and heavy-duty commercial truck engineers, manufacturers, and suppliers to conduct cutting-edge technology-neutral research that will improve fuel economy and minimize fossil fuel use. With over 256 million vehicles on our roads, it takes decades of sustained effort to turn over our fleet. It is absolutely critical that we continue developing these advanced technologies here in the United States in order to achieve major fuel savings in the future and become truly energy independent. The Vehicle Innovation Act has support from major manufacturers, labor, and environmental groups. This is something that just makes sense. I appreciate the support of Senators Murkowski and Cantwell and all my colleagues who supported including this legislation in the bipartisan energy package. While I was pleased to see this commonsense measure included, I continue to be frustrated and disappointed that this body has held up an up-or-down vote on a bipartisan package authored by Senator Stabenow and me to help the people of Flint, MI. Flint is still in crisis mode as families still do not have safe, reliable water flowing from their taps. Senator Stabenow and I will continue pursuing all paths to fight for the assistance that the people of Flint deserve. We will not give up. We remain fully committed to delivering to Flint families the assistance they need to be able to use their tap water for bathing, cooking, and drinking without the fear that it may harm them or their children. I know that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are willing and able to join us in our efforts to help Flint. I urge them to continue working with us to pass this package through the Senate as soon as possible. The people of Flint cannot wait any longer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Judiciary Committee Investigations Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to take this time to respond to Senator Reid's juvenile attacks on my Judiciary Committee's investigations and to Senator Reid's frequent crying about my previous State Department holds. Over the past several months, Senator Reid has been obsessed with mentioning holds on nominees--holds which I no longer have. Holds are often necessary to force the executive branch to comply with congressional investigations. If you want proof of that, just ask the Obama administration. In a Federal court filing during the Fast and Furious litigation, the Obama administration argued that the court should not even consider that particular case. The Justice Department's brief said courts should not enforce subpoenas at all. Instead, the Justice Department reasoned that Congress should use other powers to get documents. Here is exactly what the government brief said: ``Among other powers, Congress can withhold funds from the Executive Branch, override vetoes, decline to enact legislation, refuse to act on nominations, and adjourn.'' Later in the brief, the Obama administration specifically suggested that Congress can ``tie up nominations'' in order to get documents. If the administration can say that, why would Senator Reid think that is a wrong act for Congress to take? It is this simple: If the minority leader doesn't like Senators using holds to get documents from agencies, perhaps Senator Reid should talk to his friends in the Obama administration who suggested that in the first place. In addition, Senator Reid shows his hypocrisy since Members on his own side have held up Obama nominees, and Senator Reid never said a peep about Democrats exercising their rights. Further, Senator Reid's attempts to politicize the Judiciary Committee's oversight work are very uninformed and result in misguided statements, and Senator Reid's accusation that taxpayer money is being wasted by engaging in oversight of the executive branch rings hollow. Secretary Clinton's nongovernment server and private email arrangements effectively walled off her official communications from the normal Freedom [[Page S2374]] of Information Act and other Federal recordkeeping requirements. So to Senator Reid, I say: The Freedom of Information Act is squarely within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee and subject to oversight. The former Secretary's use of a secret, private server to conduct all of her official business led to an avalanche of Freedom of Information Act litigation. It also caused inaccurate responses to Freedom of Information Act requests. For example, in December 2012, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for records of Secretary Clinton's email addresses. The Department responded by stating: ``No records responsive to your request were located.'' That response is very misleading, at best. Senior Department officials knew about Secretary Clinton's use of private email for official correspondence since they were sending emails to her nongovernment email address. They would have known instantly of records responsive to that request that the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington submitted. Yet those senior officials apparently failed to communicate with the State Department's Freedom of Information Act office. Even then, if State's FOIA office were to search Secretary Clinton's government email account, they would find nothing since she operated a private account not subject to freedom of information. Separate from her email address, Secretary Clinton's nongovernment server was a secret to high-level officials at the State Department who were responsible for information technology and security. These officials had no idea the Secretary was operating a separate unofficial system. She did not get their approval to do so, so how would they know? The Judiciary Committee has interviewed the Chief Information Officer, the former Chief Information Officer, the former Deputy Chief Information Officer, and the Director of Diplomatic Security at the State Department. The Chief Information Officers oversaw the work of the information technology staffer who Secretary Clinton secretly paid to maintain her nonpublic server, yet all of these people knew nothing about that nonpublic server. That staffer didn't ask permission to have outside employment. While working at the State Department, he didn't disclose his outside income on his financial disclosure forms. Now, think about that. Officials whose job it is to know were kept in the dark about this ``home brew'' email server. If a government agency hopes to be transparent with the American people--and that is the point behind the Freedom of Information Act legislation--it must first be transparent with itself. Now we know that highly classified material was transmitted to and stored on Secretary Clinton's secret server. What is important about that is this is an issue of national security. State Department diplomatic security personnel have informed the Judiciary Committee that they were unaware of Secretary Clinton's using a nongovernment server for official business. So how, then, could they possibly secure it from security threats? Now, the FBI is investigating this matter as well as several other investigations. We keep hearing that the FBI's inquiry is just a security review and not a criminal inquiry. So let me tackle that. However, one witness asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination rather than answer questions about his work on Secretary Clinton's secret server. And he is relying on the Fifth Amendment to withhold his personal emails as well. Recently, the Department of Justice granted him immunity. So, quite naturally, we are searching for other ways to get information before deciding whether it might be appropriate to seek an immunity order for his testimony. Now, to Senator Reid: These are legitimate oversight inquiries for the Judiciary Committee. Further, Secretary Clinton did not turn over all of her official emails. Emails between GEN David Petraeus and Secretary Clinton, which Secretary Clinton failed to provide to the State Department, were later turned over to the Defense Department. Secretary Clinton also failed to turn over emails with Sydney Blumenthal, whom Secretary Clinton views as an off-the-books intelligence resource, while Secretary of State. If Secretary Clinton had used a government email address for official emails, we wouldn't have this problem in the first place. So how many more official emails were not turned over but should have been? The Judiciary Committee cannot ignore these important issues simply because the former Secretary decided to run for President. And to be perfectly clear, I started this investigation before Secretary Clinton announced her candidacy. Senator Reid suggested that the committee's work on these issues is a waste of money. Senator Reid, that is nonsense. Congressional oversight is not a waste of money; it is a constitutional responsibility. The minority leader fails to understand that Congress is obligated to oversee that the executive branch of government faithfully executes the laws and faithfully spends the money the way Congress intended. Without such constitutional oversight, Congress will not know if there are failures in the executive branch's duty to faithfully execute the laws that we pass. But do my colleagues know what is a real waste of money? This administration fought tooth and nail in the courts against Congress for more than 4 years. Why? Just to avoid disclosing documents in the Fast and Furious scandal that they eventually turned over. That is a waste of money--a 4-year waste of money. The Obama administration has fought against the press and watchdog organizations for years in the Freedom of Information Act litigation over former Secretary Clinton's email records. Senator Reid, that is a waste of money. It is shocking that the Obama Justice Department devotes so much taxpayer resources to avoiding the very transparency that President Obama promised on January 21, 2009--1 day into office. This administration was going to be the most transparent in the history of the entire country, and it has turned out to be the most stonewalling. None of that would be necessary if the administration would just comply with congressional subpoenas and the Freedom of Information Act. That is the way to save money. By the way, I would like to ask how much taxpayers' money does Senator Reid spend having his staff write daily speeches trying to undermine the work of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Reid also fails to understand that we are not only focused on Secretary Clinton. The committee is conducting dozens of investigations on a broad range of issues under the jurisdiction of the committee. Some of the executive branch agencies have complained about the amount of oversight work the committee does on other matters. To justify my statements for this part of my remarks, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two letters. The first is from the Department of Homeland Security, and the second is from the Department of Justice. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC, November 18, 2015. Hon. Charles E. Grassley, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Grassley: Since I became Secretary of Homeland Secretary almost two years ago, I have worked to make the Department more responsive to congressional correspondence, directives, request for reports, briefings and hearings, and other requests for documents and information. Given that some 108 committees and subcommittees of Congress (depending on how you count) assert oversight jurisdiction over this Department, this is a full-time, time consuming task. We have also participated in about 100 hearings and over 2000 non-hearing engagements with Congressional members and staff since the beginning of the 114th Congress. Members on both sides of the aisle have acknowledged our increased responsiveness. So far in 2015, I have received 46 letters from you alone-- almost one per week. I know because I read them all. Many of these letters request reams of information, data, and documents that take hundreds of hours and dozens of staff to compile. We work diligently to respond to your letters promptly, but there is a huge cost to this. [[Page S2375]] Senator, I ask for your help in focusing and prioritizing these oversight letters. I want to continue to be responsive to your requests, and I want to do so as quickly as possible. At the same time, I must ensure that my staff remains focused on all our other priorities. I welcome the opportunity to discuss with you. Sincerely, Jeh Charles Johnson. ____ U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legislative Affairs, Washington, DC, September 18, 2015. Hon. Charles E. Grassley, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: This responds to your letters to the Attorney General, dated June 12, 2015, July 10, 2015, August 13, 2015, September 14, 2015, and September 15, 2015, regarding the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The Department of Justice (the Department) has provided responses in our letters of August 14, 2015, August 25, 2015, and September 11, 2015. As noted in those letters and discussed with your staff, we continue to collect and review information, including the information noted in your letters, so we may provide a complete and thorough response to all of your inquiries as expeditiously as possible. We will continue to keep an open line of communication with your staff as we work toward additional responses to your questions. The Department takes these issues seriously, and we thank you for bringing them to our attention. As you know, this year the Department has received from your office almost 100 letters containing more than 825 questions and document requests, including the five letters received to date on this matter. While we have made and will continue to make all reasonable efforts to meet your stated deadlines, our ability to respond in a timely manner to your inquiries is impacted by the significant volume of letters we receive. We hope this information is helpful. Please do not hesitate to contact this office if we may provide additional assistance regarding this or any other matter. Sincerely, Peter J. Kadzik, Assistant Attorney General. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, both of the letters note the many dozen letters and hundreds of requests that I have sent, and both essentially complain about the volume of our investigation and requests for information. The Judiciary Committee is hard at work doing the people's business, and the committee is doing much more than just oversight. The committee has reported 16 executive nominees and 37 judicial nominees. It has processed 27 bipartisan bills out of committee, and every bill that has come out of committee is a bipartisan bill. Eighteen of those bills were passed out of the Senate over to the House, eight of which have been signed into law by the President. Just last week, the committee unanimously adopted bipartisan legislation to finally protect FBI whistleblowers who report wrongdoing to their supervisors and provide for independent review of FBI whistleblower cases for the first time. So reviewing that record, it seems to me we can ask Senator Reid to justify his claim that this committee is partisan. The committee concluded an investigation into the abuse and misuse of paid administrative leave. The committee took the results and worked hard with Members on both sides of the aisle to actually fix that problem. In February, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee approved the bipartisan, commonsense reforms in the Administrative Leave Act of 2016. Similarly, the committee has worked with Democrats and Republicans alike to overturn an Office of Legal Counsel opinion that allows the agencies across government to stonewall their inspectors general. Now let me tell my colleagues how Senator Reid is involved in stonewalling that effort. We came up with a legislative solution called the IG Empowerment Act and attempted to pass it in December by a live unanimous consent request. But Senator Reid objected to the bill even though it is supported by seven Members of his own caucus and supported by the New York Times editorial board and a host of civil liberties and good-government groups. Even the largest circulating daily newspaper in the home State of Senator Reid urged him to work with us on a compromise. But rather than engaging us in a productive and civil manner, Senator Reid publicly slandered the bill as a legislative overreach. He claimed that he was concerned about a provision that allowed inspectors general to issue testimonial subpoenas to fight waste, fraud, and abuse. In fact, Senator Reid voted--Senator Reid actually voted--to give the exact same authority to the Office of Special Counsel in 1989. That 1989 bill passed the Senate unanimously and is now law. Senator Reid, was that legislative overreach when you did it? Like that bill, the IG Empowerment Act has near unanimous support and is designed to root out wrongdoing from government, while ensuring proper safeguards of the use of subpoenas. So there is no reason to object to this bill on policy grounds. Yet Senator Reid stands in the way of getting that done. The Judiciary Committee will continue its work. I say that to just one Senator: Senator Reid. And during the course of my oversight work, I will use every tool at my disposal to obtain answers for the American people. So, Senator Reid, I will keep faith with my oath of office and ``we the people.'' I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Oklahoma City Bombing Anniversary and Nomination of Merrick Garland Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, 21 years ago this week, the families of 168 people--19 of those 168 people children--received some of the worst news of their lives. That news was that a beloved member of each of their families had been killed in the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City. We all watched the news that day, that night, the next day, and that week and beyond, as we took in the devastation caused by that blast. That horrible crime was carried out by a radical, anti-government extremist. It remains the deadliest act of homegrown terrorism in our Nation's history. For the families who lost a loved one that day in 1995, there is no way to fill the void left by a life taken too soon, but I know that our government's pursuit of justice for the lives lost that day serve as a small source of comfort for the people who were left in mourning. At the time of that heinous crime, Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, was the Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice. He immediately flew to Oklahoma City to lead the criminal investigation and supervise the prosecution of the bombers. In fact, he insisted on being sent. He didn't just volunteer. He didn't just say: Well, OK, I will go. He told his supervisors they had to let him go. He was the highest ranking Justice Department official on the ground in Oklahoma City following the bombing. He helped oversee every aspect of the investigation and the subsequent trial. His colleagues at the time have attested to Judge Garland's commitment to following the letter of the law in every aspect of that investigation. He refused to take any shortcuts that could somehow compromise the integrity of the case that he and his team were building. Through their tireless efforts, his tireless leadership, his deep understanding of the law, and scrupulous attention to detail, Judge Garland ensured the prosecution had an airtight case. Ultimately, both bombers were convicted, giving the families of the 168 victims not their sons, their daughters, their children, their moms or dads back again, but at least providing a small measure of vindication for the losses they had incurred. Judge Garland's work was so appreciated by the families and friends of those victims 21 years ago that last year, on the 20th anniversary of the bombing, the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum awarded Judge Garland its annual Reflections of Hope distinction--not the year after the bombing but 20 years after the bombing. Judge Garland has established an unparalleled reputation as a brilliant, dedicated prosecutor and jurist. He has received strong bipartisan support in the legal community, including from Alberto Gonzales, the former U.S. Attorney General and White House Counsel in the administration of President George W. Bush. So today it is not just discouraging that most of my Republican colleagues are refusing to consider Judge Garland's nomination to serve on our highest Court; personally, I believe it is outrageous. [[Page S2376]] I served for 8 years as Governor of Delaware, a State that is renowned for its own courts--supreme court, court of chancery, superior court--courts that play a national role, not just on a State level. As Governor of my State for 8 years, I nominated men and women to serve on those courts. In every one of those nominations there were hearings held, whether they were Democrat or Republican. I think during that period of time I nominated an equal number of Democrats and Republicans to the judiciary. That is the constitution of our State, and, frankly, that is a great example because in Delaware we have one of the highest regarded judiciaries. My obligation as Governor was to nominate outstanding candidates for these judgeships as they became vacant. The role of the State Senate in Delaware was to consider them. They never waited a year and left a seat vacant for a year awaiting the end of my time as Governor or any other Governor's time. That would never happen. We wouldn't waste 10 months. State senators in our State wouldn't wait 10 weeks. They did their jobs. They did their jobs. We are not doing ours, and we need to. The fact that we haven't is outrageous. When we elect Presidents to this country, we elect them for 4 years, and if they are reelected, then it is for another 4 years. They are not Presidents for 3 years and 11 months; they are not elected to a term of 3 years and 10 months. We elect them to a term of 4 years. They need to be on the job for 4 years. Our President is doing what he is supposed to do, and that is sending us the names of exceptional people who serve in incredibly important positions like the Supreme Court. He has done his job. I very much want to do mine, and I want to be joined by Democrats and Republicans in doing our jobs. Every Member of this body has taken at least one oath to uphold the Constitution--some of us, many times over. At 17 years old, not much older than the young interns who are sitting here in the Chamber, I took my first oath as a midshipman. I was a freshman at the Ohio State Navy ROTC, where I was privileged to go on a Navy scholarship. Four years later, I took another oath and raised my right hand as an ensign in the Navy. I took an oath to defend the Constitution and the country and headed to Pensacola, FL, to become a naval flight officer right in the middle of the Vietnam war. I ended up serving three tours over there during that conflict. As a Congressman, I took an oath to defend the country and Constitution. As Governor, I also took a similar oath to defend our country's Constitution--at least to defend our State's constitution. Then, as a U.S. Senator I have taken an oath any number of times. I am regarded by my colleagues as one of the least partisan people here, but I think the refusal of the majority to even consider this nomination is more than an abdication of our responsibility. I believe it is an example of playing politics with the very Constitution we have sworn to uphold. For those who don't know, Delaware is known as the First State. We are known as the First State because on December 7, 1787, before any other State had ratified the Constitution, we did. I joke with people that for 1 week Delaware was the entire United States of America. We opened things up and let in Maryland; we let in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and eventually Louisiana--even Iowa. I think for the most part it has turned out pretty well, but the idea of playing politics with the Constitution that we have sworn to uphold is deeply troubling to me. I hope that is not what is going on here, but I fear that it is. The right and just way to proceed is to begin consideration of Judge Garland's nomination, not next month and not some other year, but now-- first in committee and then on the Senate floor. We have something we call the Delaware way. We are focused on the three C's--communicate, compromise, and collaborate. That is a good example for 49 other States, and I think it is a good example right here. After all, we have been sent by the people to this hallowed place, this Senate Chamber, to put democracy into action, to protect liberty and to protect justice for all. Nearly 50 years ago, former Chief Justice Warren Burger, a conservative--I believe he was from California and was appointed or nominated by Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican. Former Chief Justice Warren Burger said, ``A sense of confidence in the courts is essential to maintain the fabric of ordered liberty for a free people.'' He went on to say that ``inefficiency and delay will drain even a just judgment of its value.'' I think the shorthand version of that is justice delayed is justice denied. Justice delayed is justice denied. By dragging our feet and trying to get into a new Congress, maybe with a new President--certainly, with a new President--that is delaying justice, I believe. In the face of the prospect of any number of potentially 4-to-4 divided verdicts in the Supreme Court with only eight members, we cannot just stand aside and let that happen. Justice Burger was right when he said those words all those years ago, and he is right today. Mr. President, I think it is time to stop this delay. It is time for us to serve the people. It is time for us to deliver justice. It is time for us to give this President's nominee the consideration demanded of us by the Constitution, which we are sworn to uphold. Mr. President, I see no colleague seeking recognition, and with that I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Prince Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to speak of the loss of the one of Minnesota's own, and that is Prince. Like all Minnesotans, today we were shocked and saddened. I grew up with Prince's music, starting with ``Little Red Corvette'' in the seventies and eighties. We won't forget ``Purple Rain'' in Minnesota. We were so proud of that movie, and everyone would point at every spot in the movie they knew from growing up. He was a superstar, composer, amazing performer, and a music innovator with a fierce belief in the independence of his art. He lived his art. He believed his words were his own, his name was his own, and he wasn't going to let anyone own him. There was absolutely nobody like him, and there never will be. Prince sold more than 100 million records worldwide. He released 39 studio albums. He had five No. 1 Billboard hits and 40 in the top 100. He won seven Grammys, an Oscar, and a Golden Globe. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the first year he was eligible. But even with all that success, even with all that fame, Minnesota never lost that sense that he was a beloved son--our neighbor, the superstar next door. I was always so proud to say: ``Prince--you know he's from Minnesota.'' He was born there, and he still lives there. The fact that Prince was a proud native of my State came through in all of his music. He pioneered the Minneapolis sound--that mixture of funk, rock, and pop that emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s and influenced music for decades to come. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Janet Jackson, Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson, Justin Timberlake, The Weeknd, Beyonce--these are just some of the many artists who were influenced by that sound. But that sound didn't just influence artists, it influenced everyone who heard it. Prince's music touched our hearts, opened our minds, and made us want to dance. That is his legacy, and that is what we will always remember. Prince made ``Purple Rain'' a household name. Like most Minnesotans, I remember the first time I listened to that album. It was, as his band was then called, a revolution. It changed music forever and is considered among the best in music history. Two of the songs on that album--``When Doves Cry,'' which is especially notable because he plays all of the instruments in the song, and ``Let's Go Crazy''--rose to the top of the charts. [[Page S2377]] ``Let's Go Crazy'' includes a lesson important to remember on days like today. There is a world waiting for us after this life, Prince sang, ``a world of never ending happiness, where you can always see the sun, day or night.'' I know that today all of us hope Prince is standing in that Sun. Prince sang that song at First Avenue--the venue in downtown Minneapolis--when he introduced his band to the city in 1983. There, too, Prince shot some of the scenes for his classic ``Purple Rain'' film. Today the club is a landmark and a must-play venue for some of the best artists. I personally stood in Prince's dressing room surrounded by pictures of him. The building is covered in stars with the names of artists who have performed there, and there will always be one star that will shine the brightest, and that is the man who made it the landmark it is--Prince. Minnesota loves Prince, and Prince loved Minnesota. He was born in Minneapolis. He went to Central High School, where he played piano and guitar for a band called Grand Central. He recorded his early demo tapes with Chris Moon and at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis. Throughout his life, he called Minnesota home. He wrote a song about the Minnesota Vikings--he was always a big fan--appropriately titled ``Purple and Gold.'' At the end of last year when the Minnesota Lynx--our women's basketball team--won the WNBA championship, he held a concert at his recording studio, Paisley Park, for local fans, who got to enjoy his music well into the night. Just a few days ago, he hosted a dance party there and made a brief appearance. In some way, it was his last gift to our State. But his best and lasting gift? His music, his innovation, his energy. When accepting BET's Lifetime Achievement Award, Prince said: The future's in your hands now. And the world really is yours. Well, that world is a whole lot cooler because Prince was in it, and it is a whole lot sadder today now that he is gone. My heart goes out to his friends and family and to all who mourn his loss today. We will miss the artist Prince. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Paris Climate Agreement Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am on the floor I guess just a few moments ahead of the ranking member of our Senate Foreign Relations Committee, my friend Ben Cardin, who is on his way but has authorized me to proceed with a few remarks on the topic that he and I, and perhaps others, would like to address, which is tomorrow's signing in New York of the Paris climate agreement. Over 160 nations around the world are going to be participating in signing that agreement that will move many of them immediately into their program of compliance and signify for others a statement of intention to join. I think it is the largest international agreement, in terms of the number of countries involved, ever, certainly the biggest one I can think of. So it is very significant in that respect. One other thing about Paris that I think was also very significant is what took place in America's corporate sector in support of a strong Paris Agreement. The President and groups like Ceres, with particular leadership from companies like Unilever, got together and created a remarkable American corporate coalition with more than 150 companies, including ones like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, Ford and GM, Nike, and VF industries, General Mills, Cargill, Apple, Google--a terrific coalition; kind of the who's who of corporate America. They got together to urge the countries of the world to be bold in Paris, to have it be a strong agreement, and to show their support for an international program to address climate change, which I think is terrific. The distinguished junior Senator from Louisiana is presiding, and I can't think off the top of my head what Louisiana-based companies are part of that coalition, but certainly companies that are based in virtually every State we represent in the Senate--major companies: Walmart, for instance, out of Arkansas; Coca-Cola, out of Georgia; VF industries, out of North Carolina; some of our biggest electric utilities; the bulk of the property casualty insurance and reinsurance industry. It is very significant that America's corporate community came so strongly together. I hope very much that is a message that not only resonated in Paris but that will resonate in Congress as well because I would bet that every single one of us have a significant home State corporation that has signed that pledge, and some of us will have many significant home State corporations that will have signed that pledge. So when you have gotten to the point where the leadership of America's corporate community has signed on to the fact that something needs to be done and that America ought to lead--that is our role in the world--that will begin more and more to have an effect in this body to counter some of the nonsense and mischief that a very small slice in the fossil fuel industry has been propagating at the expense of the broader American corporate community, which, by and large, has been pretty outstanding on this. Let me also mention one other thing that has happened just this afternoon, which I am very encouraged by; that is, an amendment that has been filed by 10 Senators--bipartisan, 5 and 5. It is the Graham- Whitehouse amendment. The cosponsors on the Republican side are Senators Graham, Kirk, Ayotte, Collins, and Portman. On the Democratic side, they are Whitehouse, Merkley, Schatz, Markey, and Brown. The amendment reads: Climate change is real, and human activity contributes to climate change. Climate change is already affecting the American people and poses an increasing risk to our health, security, economy, and infrastructure. Over 180 nations, including China, India, and Brazil, have made commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, creating opportunities for American workers and innovative private industry benefits from global clean energy markets. Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that the United States should be a world leader in addressing climate change; that Congress is best positioned to address policies that leave a prosperous economy and healthy environment for future generations; that Congress has a responsibility to take actions that reduce emissions and combat climate change; and, finally, that Congress should support research and development to bolster clean energy technology. In that latter regard, let me note the Mission Innovation Initiative that has come out of Secretary Moniz's Department of Energy and out of a significant group of major investors around the world. The deal basically is that countries involved will try to double our clean energy R&D, and in return these major investors from around the world, led by Bill Gates, will set up a significant fund that will take the emerging technologies that early R&D can discover and bring them through the various early investment stages of what investors and startup folks call the valleys of death on the way to becoming a sustainable company so those technologies can be brought forward on an accelerated basis. So when you look at Paris, you not only see this enormous array of nations coming together in a common cause, you see right behind it virtually the entirety of the leadership of America's corporate sector coming right in with it and saying: This is what we want. This is what we encourage. We want it to be strong. You have the biggest investors in the world, most of them coming together and saying: We are going to have your back with investment into new types of clean energy funding. And then you have the governments of the world not only signing up for--not all of them but the ones participating in Mission Innovation-- signing up, in addition to the treaty, for this commitment to increase R&D and press innovation in this space forward. So for all those reasons and more, tomorrow is a good news day for our country. It is a good news day for [[Page S2378]] progress and innovation, it is a good news day for the enormous array of American corporate leaders who have supported and cheered on this particular occasion, and I think it is an occasion for pride on the part of the United States of America that the signing will be taking place in the United States in New York, that Secretary Kerry will be attending, that the Chinese leader will be attending, and that people from all around the world will be there not only recognizing the need to do this but recognizing America's leadership in getting us to this place. I will close with a personal note of appreciation for a gentleman named Todd Stern. Todd was the climate negotiator for the Department of State for many years, and some of those were rather bleak years in which the United States was not showing leadership. So Todd had to hang in there and endure that frustration and keep his candle of faith burning until the day came when we finally began to kick in at last. His role was very important in getting us prepared for and through the Paris Agreement. He is retiring and has served his country well. So I will close with a word of good will for that particular public servant who has done right by his duty and done right by his country. With that, I yield the floor, and with any luck, we can await the arrival of Senator Cardin in due course. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Prince Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks today regarding climate change, I wish to say a few words about a Minnesota icon who passed away today. Prince was a phenomenal artist who was beloved by people all over the world, but as Minnesotans, we are particularly proud to call him one of our own. Prince got his start in a Minneapolis jazz band and went on to share his talent throughout Minnesota and all over the globe. His artistry, his innovation, and his unparalleled presence inspired and will continue to inspire millions of people. In Minneapolis, he put one of our most cherished venues, First Avenue, on the map. Up until just a few days ago, he was still performing, having held a concert in Atlanta. He is truly going to be missed. Someone once said: A brain isn't a mind, and a mind isn't a soul, and that is why we need the artists. I think the outpouring of appreciation we are seeing today for Prince has to do with that unique role artists play, and it speaks to the importance of the arts and to human beings. Paris Climate Agreement Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in celebrating the official signing of the Paris climate agreement. Tomorrow, more than 160 countries will send representatives to New York to sign onto this historic agreement. This gathering is set to become the most well-attended signing event in the history of the United Nations--highlighting the importance of this issue for people around the entire world. I think it is very fitting that this event is taking place on Earth Day. This agreement has been nearly 25 years in the making. International climate efforts date back to 1992, when governments met in Rio with the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations. Nations have met every year since then to further this goal. While some meetings have been more successful than others, most have been met with disappointment and lack of action. After all, climate change is a complex issue, and achieving consensus for any international issue is no small fete, which is why this agreement is truly, truly impressive. Last December, I traveled to Paris with nine of my colleagues. We met with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, with U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, and with our then top climate change negotiator Todd Stern. I would like to congratulate all of them for their stellar work. I would also like to thank Todd Stern for his service at the State Department and his dedication to combating climate change. Mr. Stern played a critical role in achieving a successful resolution in Paris, and I have no doubt that his successor, Dr. Jonathan Pershing, will effectively continue his work. Climate change is an existential threat to our planet and to future generations. My colleagues have been on the floor of the Senate today to talk about the impacts of climate change on their States and the need to address it. So I wish to take a minute to talk about how it is going to impact Minnesota. Minnesota is one of the top producing agricultural States in the country, where one out of five jobs is tied to agriculture. Climate change will have significant impact on our food system, both through warmer temperatures and more intense droughts. A recent study estimates that global crop production could decrease by more than 40 percent by the end of the century. That is why I joined Dave MacLennan, the CEO of Cargill--the largest privately owned company in the country--in penning an op-ed in the Minneapolis StarTribune to highlight this threat, especially considering that the global population will reach 9 billion by midcentury. As the CEO of a company focused on agriculture, David is concerned about what climate change is going to do to our food supply. Climate change will also impact our waters. Minnesota is the Land of 10,000 Lakes. Actually, it is about 14,000 lakes, including Lake Superior, which contains about 10 percent of the world's fresh surface water. Lake Superior has about 10 percent of the fresh surface water on Earth. Lake Superior is warming by 2 degrees per decade. We are seeing more evaporation and lower water levels in the lake. Plus, rising temperatures allow for more favorable conditions for invasive species and hazardous algal blooms. Warmer temperatures could also have severe consequences to fish like walleye and trout, which are so important to Minnesota fisheries and to our ecosystems. Let's not forget the threat of climate change to our forests. Like our lakes, warmer temperatures elevate the threat of invasive species-- invasive species such as the emerald ash borer and gypsy moth, which are rapidly changing the composition of our forests. In other parts of the country, we are seeing longer wildfire seasons--wildfires that are burning hotter, more intense, and bigger. The Forest Service is spending more and more fighting these fires--now more than half of its entire budget. So we can see that climate change poses a very serious threat to Minnesota, our country, and the world. The Paris Agreement that we will sign tomorrow marks an important step forward to address this threat. But, of course, our job is not done. We have to remain vigilant and build upon the success of the agreement. Internationally, we have to hold other nations accountable, ensure that they commit to stronger emission reduction targets over time, and make sure that those reductions are transparent and verifiable. Domestically, we have to build on the success of our cities and States--like Minnesota--that have been working hard for a long time now to become more energy efficient and reduce emissions. I have two grandchildren, and I am expecting a third later this year. God willing, they will live through this century and into the next. I want them to know that when we had the opportunity to put the Earth on a safer path, we seized the moment. Let's recognize the historic nature of this year's Earth Day, and let's celebrate this climate agreement because it is an important milestone. Let's build on it to make the planet a safer and more habitable place for our grandchildren, their children, and their grandchildren. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from Minnesota, Senator Franken, for his comments concerning an important day tomorrow. It is important for many reasons. We have worked a long time to get the global community engaged on climate change. As Senator Franken pointed out, tomorrow is Earth Day. It will be the [[Page S2379]] 46th anniversary of Earth Day, which was started by our former colleague Senator Gaylord Nelson. He did that because he recognized it is important for this country to recognize our global responsibilities to our environment and to our future. There is no greater challenge that we face than climate change because climate change has been caused, in part, by our own activities here on Earth, by the emission of greenhouse gases. We have a responsibility to reverse the current trends. We can do that. Tomorrow in New York City, many leaders will come to sign the COP21 agreement that was negotiated in Paris earlier this year by 16 nations representing 98 percent of the global greenhouse emissions. This is a historic moment. I want to reflect for a moment about the U.S. leadership that has brought us to this moment in which we now have an agreement among so many countries of the world. We have been trying to do this now for a long time. We have not been successful. At last, the global community has come together with meaningful commitments that will put us on the right path, and the U.S. leadership made this possible. I want to congratulate President Obama for his leadership on this. I was with Secretary Moniz in Paris. Ten members of the U.S. Senate went to Paris during the COP21 negotiations. We were there less than 48 hours, but I think we were able to broadcast the united support for U.S. leadership for a global commitment. Secretary of Energy Moniz took us to the exhibit where we saw firsthand U.S. technology that will help us meet the challenges of climate change--how we can produce energy more efficiently and how we can use energy more efficiently. It was U.S. technology, and that technology will be used around the world. I mention that because U.S. global leadership is critically important to help save our planet from the adverse impacts of climate change, yes, but it also will help our economy. It will help our economy, obviously, in dealing with the effects of climate change but also in U.S. technology being used around the world, creating jobs here in the United States. This is an urgent issue. If I might, let me first quote from Pope Francis. He said: The urgent challenge to protect our common home includes a concern to bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change. . . . I urgently appeal, for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all. . . . Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political, and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. I couldn't agree with him more. This is a global challenge with global, grave consequences if we don't get it right. I see that in my own State of Maryland's Smith Island, which is disappearing into the Chesapeake Bay. I see it in the Chesapeake Bay with the loss of sea grasses because of warmer water temperatures. Sea grasses are critically important to the survival of the Maryland blue crab. I see it in our coastal safety, as we see more and more storms with more consequences. Recently I traveled to the southern part of Africa, and I had a chance to see from a helicopter the impact of climate change. In the southern part of Africa, they have only two seasons: the rainy season and the dry season. They are now at about one season: the dry season. We were there during the rainy season, and by helicopter we flew over land that should have been part of a pond. Instead, it was dry, no water. We saw the carcasses of animals that couldn't survive because of the drought. Climate change is real and is affecting our planet. There are vulnerable nations--from the Marshall Islands to Bangladesh and so many others--whose very existence is at risk because of climate change. This is an urgent issue that requires an urgent response. But here we can make a difference. We can make a difference through conserving and using less energy and producing our energy in a more environmentally friendly way in a carbon-free environment. I am joined by Congressman Delaney and many Members of both the House and Senate in saying that the United States should make a commitment to produce at least 50 percent of our electricity through a carbon-free source by the year 2030. We can do that. Here is the good news. It will not only be good for our environment, it will be good for our economy and good for our national security. Renewable energy sources can be produced here in America. You don't have to depend on the fossil fuels from countries who disagree with our way of life. For the sake of our national security, for the sake of our national economy, there are more jobs in clean energy than there are in fossil fuel industry. For all those reasons--for our economy, for our security, and for our environment--U.S. leadership in dealing with these solutions can help America's security. Yes, U.S. leadership is absolutely vital. We saw that in COP21. Without U.S. leadership, it could not be done. Here is where I really call upon our colleagues. I have said this many times on the floor of the Senate. It is a great honor to serve in the Senate; it is a great honor to represent the people of Maryland. Every Congress has tried to add to its record to protect the future generations as it relates to our environment. The protection of our environment has never been a partisan issue. I would urge our colleagues to find ways that we can work together to build the legacy of this Congress to further protect our environment for future generations. We should be part of the solution. Tomorrow is Earth Day. Let's make a difference. With what we see happening in New York and by our actions, let us protect future generations. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Pending: Alexander/Feinstein amendment No. 3801, in the nature of a substitute. Alexander amendment No. 3804 (to amendment No. 3801), to modify provisions relating to Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees. Alexander (for Hoeven) amendment No. 3811 (to amendment No. 3801), to prohibit the use of funds relating to a certain definition. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Amendment No. 3811 Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I understand that shortly we are going to be voting on the Hoeven amendment. The Hoeven amendment would prevent the clean water rule from going into effect. In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act in response to what was happening around this country. We saw rivers literally catch on fire as a result of polluted waterways. We had Lake Erie, which was considered dead. The Chesapeake Bay was one of the world's first marine dead zones. That is nothing to be proud of. The environment and status of our water was a national disgrace, and through congressional leadership, we passed the Clean Water Act. We did that because we understood that the status of upstream water affects the status of downstream water--that we are all in this together. We understood that having clean water was a public health issue, from swimming in the water to the source of our drinking water supplies. One third of our drinking water supplies come from regulated waters. We also understood it was important for our economy. The status of tourism very much depended upon the quality of our water. Literally, people were concerned about going close to some of our inner harbor water areas. The Baltimore Inner Harbor is a tourist attraction, as are the inner harbors of many of our cities. It is important for our economy for agriculture. Agriculture depends upon clean water. We understood that when we passed the Clean Water Act in 1972. And we also understood it was a matter of quality of life for the people in our country. From those who hike and do bird watching to those who enjoy fishing and hunting, the status of clean water very much affects the way we enjoy life. As Senators from Maryland, Senator Mikulski and I both understand the importance of clean water for the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and the largest estuary in our hemisphere. It was at great risk because of waters coming in from other States into the Chesapeake Bay watershed, affecting the quality of water of the Chesapeake Bay. It was for all those reasons that we passed the 1972 Clean Water Act. We understood the enforcement of the waters that were regulated under the 1972 Clean Water Act. It was based upon best science. Science told us what we needed to do in order to have clean water-- clean water for our environment, clean water for safe drinking water-- and it was well understood until a Supreme Court decision. That decision in 2006, known as the Rapanos decision, was a 5-to-4 decision of the Supreme Court, which remanded the case, but it was a 4-to-4 decision on the merits of the case. Since that time, there has been uncertainty as to what bodies of water can be regulated under the Clean Water Act. So this was a situation caused by the ambiguity of the Supreme Court case. It is interesting that the decision on the merits was 4-to-4, as we are now debating whether we are going to have a full Supreme Court in order to make decisions that affect the clarity of law in this country. The Rapanos decision sent back to the lower courts a decision on how to decide this. Since that time, there has been uncertainty as to what bodies are legally regulated under the 1972 Clean Water Act. Remember, this was 2006. The easiest way to resolve this was for Congress to pass a law clarifying the Clean Water Act, but Congress has chosen not to do that. So the Obama administration has done what it should do, using its power to promulgate a regulation that would provide clarity as to which bodies of water are regulated. Guess what. They have done that in a way that is consistent with how the law was enforced prior to the Rapanos decision--without much complaint before the Rapanos decision. It basically goes back to best science and tells us logically what needs to be regulated. That is what this rule would do: Protect our clean water. There is a lot of misinformation that has been given about the clean water rule. Quite frankly, normal farming activities don't require any permits under the Clean Water Act. If we listen to some of the arguments against the Clean Water Act, we would have a hard time comparing that to what, in fact, is in the bill. The Clean Water Act would reestablish the well-thought regulatory framework for protecting our clean water so that we don't return to the days of jeopardizing the Chesapeake Bay or jeopardizing our rivers or jeopardizing our clean water supplies or our environment. Tomorrow is Earth Day. Forty-six years ago, our colleague Senator Gaylord Nelson established Earth Day. What will this Congress's legacy be? What will we be remembered for in regards to protecting this planet, protecting our country, and protecting our environment for future generations? I [[Page S2358]] hope we will work together to build on the proud accomplishments of our predecessors for clean air and clean water. The first thing we can do is to make sure we reject the Hoeven amendment. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. I am pleased to see Senators Alexander and Feinstein working to put together a good, bipartisan bill with no ideological or partisan policy riders. They remind us of the way that we should be doing business here in the Senate. This legislation provides increased funding for infrastructure across the Nation and in my home State of Illinois, and I was proud to support it in the Appropriations Committee. The bill provides strong funding for the National Labs through the Department of Energy, including critical research programs at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. These labs are supporting thousands of scientists from across the country and around the world as they perform pioneering research and transform technologies for science and industry. Lab facilities in Illinois perform cutting-edge research and are a bright example of American innovation. The Energy and Water Appropriations bill would invest $6 billion in the Army Corps of Engineers, which will help support important investments in Illinois infrastructure. Waterways in Illinois, including the Mississippi River, are critical to commerce around the country. They provide access for shipped goods, connecting the Great Lakes with the Gulf of Mexico. The Army Corps also plays an important role in flood control projects, something we saw firsthand in Illinois and across the Mississippi valley area after flooding this past winter. But there is always more work to be done. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, America scores a D-minus in investment in levees and inland waterways, and a D in investment in dams. This bill is a good start to making the critical investments we need in American infrastructure. So I am not sure why, after Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein pulled together such a strong bipartisan bill, Republicans would want to try to add a poison pill rider preventing an EPA rule that keeps our water clean. Many economists and military leaders tell us that water will be to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th century. Water is going to be that indispensable commodity that makes progress possible; an essential commodity over which wars will be fought. The United States has more clean water today than any other nation on the planet, and it is because of the Great Lakes. Why would we knowingly, deliberately, spoil this precious commodity that is a source of conflict between other nations? We can't afford to stop making a real difference in our clean water supply, and let me tell you why. The EPA and Army Corps clean water rule provides stronger water quality standards to protect our Nation's streams, wetlands, and navigable water. These are all resources that we rely heavily on for drinking water and recreation. And one in three Americans, or 117 million people, get drinking water from sources that were vulnerable to pollution before the clean water rule. Now, more than ever, we must work to ensure our water is safe. We know what can happen when our water supply isn't protected. The Flint, MI, water contamination crisis and high lead levels in the water supply in other communities across the country and in Illinois are reminders of this. But it is not just lead that we have to worry about. Pollutants from factories and sewage treatment plants; waste from confined animal feeding operations; pesticides used on crops; and mining wastewater all flow into tributaries that eventually flow into the Great Lakes, the source of clean water for 35 million people. Attempts to roll back the clean water rule will not only return us to a patchwork of water protections that make it difficult for businesses, farmers, and others to know whether waterways are covered by the law. It will also risk one of our greatest commodities that supports agriculture, recreation, tourism, and energy production. To see the impacts of rolling back these protections, we need to look no further than the Gulf of Mexico, which has one of the largest dead zones in the world. Let me tell you what a dead zone is: Dead zones are the result of an overabundance of algae growth, which eventually decompose and steal oxygen from the water, making it hard for anything to live. Nutrient runoff from 12 States along the Mississippi River trickles down into the Gulf of Mexico. Last year, the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico reached 6,474 square miles, roughly the size of the State of Connecticut. The State of Illinois was one of the largest contributors to this nutrient overload, a combination of runoff from our farm fields and point source pollution such as wastewater plants. We need to reduce this nutrient runoff while protecting our agriculture economy in Illinois. The clean water rule does exactly that by exempting agricultural activities from its provisions. I urge my colleagues to vote against any ideological poison pill amendment that would prevent clean water appropriations from moving forward to protect our children, our communities, and our economy. Without ideological riders like the clean water rule amendment, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill is a bipartisan effort that proves we can make smart investments that make the most sense for our country--right now and as we plan for our future. The current lead crisis has shown that we need to get serious about investing in infrastructure programs and support regulations to ensure that every American--especially children--has access to safe, clean drinking water. Now is the time for Congress to act responsibly to develop a budget that enables our country to thrive. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The Senator from Indiana. Wasteful Spending Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this is No. 40 of ``Waste of the Week.'' For the 40 weeks the Senate has been in session this cycle, I have come down to the Floor to talk about a waste of taxpayers' dollars through waste, fraud, and abuse. This week I am going to talk about yet another Federal program which has, at best, a questionable track record. I filed an amendment to the Energy and Water appropriations bill currently in the Senate, which is related to this program, and hopefully we will be voting on the amendment I will be offering in a few moments to address this issue. This amendment, which I offered with Senators Fischer, Toomey, and Flake, would finally wind down the Department of Energy's failed Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. Remember the stimulus? Remember how we were throwing all kinds of taxpayers' money out there? We talked about advanced vehicle programs, and many of these distributions of funds have been misused or simply have not come to fruition, and a great deal of money has been wasted. The ATVM Loan Program continues to sit on billions of dollars of unused funds that could be put to better use. I am glad there are some unused funds there because it means that when we look at the history of this program, perhaps we will have an opportunity to better use those unused funds or to help return it back to the Treasury so the taxpayer isn't on the hook for this kind of thing going forward. Let me explain this program. The Department of Energy's Advanced Vehicle Technology Manufacturing Loan Program was created in 2007. It was created to provide very low-interest loans to manufacturers that make vehicles or components of vehicles that use alternative energy. I am not here to downplay the use of alternative energy. I think that is something that is happening throughout our country. Hopefully, it is on a market basis. To qualify for this loan, there were a couple of requirements applicants must meet: No. 1, the vehicle or component must be new or significantly improved from what is currently available in the U.S. marketplace; No. 2, it has to be manufactured in the United States. The purpose of the program, partly, was to encourage manufacturing here--not in China, not somewhere else. [[Page S2359]] Last month, nearly 10 years since the program's inception, the Government Accountability Office took a look at the program's finances and found that the Department of Energy has billions of unused and unspent funds. I am glad they do because a lot of things that have taken place under this program have not proven to be worth their weight. I have spoken before on a number of programs, but in 2011, under this fund--the Alternative Vehicle Fund--the Obama administration approved a $730 million loan to a company called Severstal Steel Company, a Russian-owned company with operations in Michigan. Remember, to qualify for this loan, the alternative fuel vehicle or vehicle part needs to be manufactured in the United States and--here is the key--it must be a new product. Technically, Severstal was manufacturing in the United States, but the Obama administration certainly walked the line in this case. The U.S. Government was providing American taxpayer dollars to a Russian company owned by one of Russia's richest oligarchs, Alexei Mordashov. The New York Times has reported that Mr. Mordashov has ties to the Kremlin and to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Apparently, this Russian looked at this program and said: Hey, here is a way I can get a low-cost, low-interest loan. All I have to do is operate this plant and the government will loan me $750 million and I will produce a new part, a new component of steel that is used in automobile manufacturing. After working with the Department of Energy's inspector general, Senator Toomey and I learned that the type of steel made by this Russian company was identical to the steel already being produced in my home State of Indiana and Senator Toomey's home State of Pennsylvania. Obviously, that violated one of the basic criteria in that the product has to be an alternative that is brand new or significantly improved and not something that is already being produced in Indiana. Fortunately, with the help of the inspector general, we were able to ensure the Obama administration voided the loan. To their credit, when we brought it to their attention, they said: OK. We have a Russian oligarch we are giving money to--and that doesn't sound very good. We are giving money to this multibillionaire in Russia with close ties to Vladimir Putin. Secondly, we now have learned what they are producing is already produced in the United States--in my State of Indiana and in Senator Toomey's State of Pennsylvania. Thus, fortunately, the administration canceled this loan. This example calls into question the integrity of this program. The ATVM Program also has a lackluster success rate. For example, Fisker Automotive received a $529 million loan to produce a $100,000 plug-in hybrid sports car. You will not see any of these on the road because the company went bankrupt after drawing down $193 million of taxpayer funds. Another loan recipient, VPG, planned to sell natural gas-powered vans. It went bankrupt after receiving a $50 million government loan. Of the five projects funded by this program to date, two of them have gone bankrupt. I think these examples demonstrate what happens when the government tries to pick winners and losers instead of letting the free market determine how we are going to go forward. The Coats-Fischer-Flake-Toomey amendment that will be offered would wind down this program and it would make much better use of the unspent funds from this program. I want to be clear. This amendment prohibits DOE from reviewing any new loan applications after the bill's enactment. There are currently some pending applications. We do not address those pending applications. I hope serious evaluation will be made relative to whether they qualify under the criteria that is laid out and we will not end up with any more Severstals. Those who argue that this shuts down an alternative energy program is not valid. Anything that is now being currently evaluated up through the end of 2020, the next 5 years--will be allowed to go forward and be evaluated under the program. The amendment doesn't take that away. CBO scored this amendment as saving at least $300 million over the next 10 years. I have been down here every week talking about a waste of the week. I have just identified another waste of taxpayer dollars. We are not counting that, but we are counting what we can save if this amendment is adopted. It is $300 million. I think that is a significant amount it raises our waste, fraud, and abuse level to $162 billion and change. I encourage my colleagues to work with us so we can offer this amendment. Remember, it does not affect anybody who has a proposal before the Department of Energy under this loan program. If that is underway, it can be evaluated--hopefully successfully evaluated, and if it doesn't qualify the criteria, won't be accepted. The amendment does not free funds for anything that is not currently before the evaluators of this program. I trust we can gain the support of my colleagues in saving the taxpayers some dollars. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3811 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are going to vote on the Hoeven amendment shortly. I rise to speak against that amendment, which would undermine one of our Nation's landmark environmental laws, the Clean Water Act. It is very difficult for me to understand how we could be at this point in time attacking a clean water rule--a clean water rule in light of what has happened in Flint, MI. This is what the water looked like as it came out of the tap in Flint at the height of the crisis. By the way, people were told this was safe. Why on Earth would we be going against the clean water rule at a time when we are fighting against this kind of problem? This is what the pipes looked like in Flint: the corrosion, the obvious problems with lead. This was all getting right into the drinking water. While we look for ways to help the people of Flint--and I would love do it on this bill. If we can't do it on this bill, I would love do it on the WRDA bill. If we can't do it on the WRDA bill, I will do it on any bill. We need to take care of what happened there, and we also need to help other communities from the east coast to the middle of our Nation, to the west coast and help us help our families. Here we have in the face of Flint an attack on the clean water rule. Let's see what else we have to say and what else we learned about what happened in Flint. Pregnant women, kids cautioned over Jackson water. This is in Mississippi. Jackson, MS, also has a problem with lead. What is our response to that today? To stop a clean water rule. What are my Republican friends thinking? It doesn't make sense. The Associated Press wrote this: ``Elevated lead levels found in Newark schools' drinking water.'' Here we are talking about elevated levels of lead in Newark. We have places in California where the kids can't drink the water out of a water fountain. So what is the response of the Republican Senate? Turn back a clean water rule. It makes absolutely no sense. What we have going on, on the Senate floor, is a very heated debate, as I speak, about how to handle the issue in Flint. Let me tell you this. The first thing to do in the light of Flint is not to weaken environmental law, is not to stop a clean water rule. It is completely ridiculous. My friends will say: All we are doing is delaying implementation for a year while the court looks at it. We shouldn't be doing anything that plays into the hands of those special interests that simply don't want to clean up the water in our Nation. The clean water standards that are a target of this amendment are designed to safeguard drinking water for America's families and businesses. This dangerous amendment rolls back protections of small streams and wetlands that provide drinking water to one in three Americans. That is 117 million people put at risk because this U.S. Senate, run by the Republicans, [[Page S2360]] thinks the best thing to do in the light of Flint is to roll back the Clean Water Act. Come on. Get a life. Read the paper. Look at what happened to those people. This is the time to provide reliable drinking water to all Americans and to clean up our waterways. Now is not the time--and it should not be the time--to attack the Clean Water Act, which is vital to the health and safety of our families. I want to mention that I have received opposition to the Hoeven amendment from numerous sportsmen's groups, including Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, International Federation of Fly Fishers, National Wildlife Federation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, and Trout Unlimited. These groups understand the important link between clean water and the outdoor recreation economy. When you go right after the clean water rule, you are going after the people who enjoy outdoor recreation, and they are against the Hoeven amendment. Leading environmental and conservation groups oppose the amendment, including American Rivers, Clean Water Action, Earthjustice, Earthworks, Environment America, Environmental Defense Fund, League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council, Prairie Rivers Network, Sierra Club, and Southern Environmental Law Center. These are some of the most popular groups in the country. Does anyone know what the rating of this Republican Congress was in the last polls I saw? It was 14 percent. Do you know what the rating of the President was in the last poll I saw? Over 50. So what does the Republican Senate do today? They are going after the President with their 14-percent rating in the polls. I say to my friends on the other side--and believe me, they are my friends: What are you doing? How do you expect people to support you when you, after seeing what happened in Flint, continue to go after landmark environmental clean water laws like you are doing today? In addition, public health groups, including the American Public Health Association, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Trust for America's Health, have opposed similar legislation to block this important rule, and 200,000 businesses represented by the American Sustainable Business Council have called on Senators to oppose efforts to block the clean water rule. These experts understand the importance of the clean water rule, and they know that our drinking water remains vulnerable to pollution. Just last month, EPA released a report showing that nearly half of U.S. waterways are in poor condition. In fact, one in four waterways have levels of bacteria that fail to meet human health standards, and our children go swimming in these very waterways. We have cities across the United States with sewer systems that discharge raw, untreated sewage in waterways--again, where our children swim. It is a disgrace. Despite enormous successes since passage of the Clean Water Act, we have more work to do. Nothing is more important than protecting the lives of the American people, whether it is through our military or through our public health laws. When we weaken the Clean Water Act, as the Hoeven amendment will do, we put our families and our children at risk. Why are we here? Flint has put a spotlight on the need to keep our families safe from toxins and pollutants in their drinking water. The first thing the Republicans do in light of Flint is to try to roll back the clean water rule. I have to say that one of my deepest regrets--and I have written about it--is how partisan this place has become over environmental laws. When I started a long time ago, Republicans were the ones leading the way on the environment. I remember there was a Republican State senator named Peter Behr, whom I supported because he understood how critical it was to protect and defend the environment, not only as a legacy to our children in terms of the beauty of our planet but also for the very health and safety of our families. I have been in office for 40 years. It is hard to believe that it has been 40 years. I guess time flies when you like your work. The fact is that no one has ever come up to me and said: Barbara, our water and air is too pure and way too clean. You need to do something about that. You need to dirty it up. Repeal the landmark laws, Barbara, that protect our water. They don't do that. They come up and say: We are worried about the fact that we are not sure what contaminants are in our water. I see my good friend is going to close out the debate, and I promised him that when he came to the floor, he wouldn't have to listen too long. I say again: Please vote against the Hoeven amendment. This is not smart legislation in light of what we face. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I will yield the floor to the good Senator from Michigan for a minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wanted to make a quick statement about an amendment that will come up for consideration on the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, of course I support my friend from Michigan, but we need to quickly move to a vote on the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wanted to quickly take a moment to speak about the vehicle program from two sides. When I authored this legislation back in 2007, we began to see fuel economy standards increase in the United States. Part of our focus at that time was to keep jobs in America and make sure we had low-cost financing available for companies, such as retool plants, so that smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles would be made in the United States rather than have those jobs shipped overseas. We saw that with the initial loan made to Ford Motor Company. They were able to bring jobs back from Mexico and also focus on electric vehicles. As we fast forward to today, we are looking at fuel economy for trucks and larger vehicles. A loan was recently made to Alcoa. They are focused on aluminum materials so companies can make lighter weight trucks in order to meet new fuel economy standards. There are positives, but there are also areas under this loan program that have not been successful. I come to the floor to specifically say that when it is time to consider the Coats amendment, which will completely eliminate this program, my colleagues need to know that we are undercutting a carefully crafted bipartisan compromise with Senator Inhofe, Senator Portman, and others to move forward on a water infrastructure plan to deal with lead in water that will not only help 100,000 people in the city of Flint, but it will also help people in Jackson, MS, Cleveland, OH, and other States across the country. Our proposal responsibly phases out this program and uses the funds for critical water infrastructure needs. We strongly oppose pulling the rug out from under not only Flint but also Jackson, MS, Cleveland, OH, and communities across the country that are counting on us to come together and pass what we have done in a bipartisan way to address critical water infrastructure needs and deal with the lead poisoning issues. I ask colleagues to vote no on the Coats amendment and allow us to phase out this program in a way so that we will be able to use this investment in a critical way to address water infrastructure needs across the country. I thank the Presiding Officer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am willing to yield to the junior Senator from Michigan. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I concur with my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow. We urge our colleagues [[Page S2361]] to vote no on the Coats amendment. This is part of a very carefully crafted amendment to deal with water infrastructure around the country, and in particular Flint. I think this will be a win-win for those folks who may want to see this program go away. We have a plan to do that while also dealing with an incredibly important issue not only for our State but that is also incredibly important to other States across the country. I urge a ``no'' vote. I thank the Senator for yielding the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Amendment No. 3811 Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support an amendment I offered, amendment No. 3811, that prevents the EPA and the Corps of Engineers from implementing its waters of the United States final rule. The language for my amendment is actually identical to the waters of the United States provision in the underlying bill. It is already in the bill, H.R. 2028, which we are considering right now. My amendment will make sure that this waters of the United States provision stays in the bill and that our bill is consistent with legislation supported by the House. It is critical to preserve the prohibition on implementing the waters of the United States because this rule will greatly expand the scope of EPA regulations over nearly every water in the United States, threatening farmers and job creators with permitting requirements and litigation that will make it more difficult for them to produce our Nation's food and complete needed construction projects. Moreover, this regulatory overreach by the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA is inconsistent with the law. Let's look at what the courts are saying. When granting a preliminary injunction against this rule, the North Dakota Federal District Court stated: The Rule allows EPA regulation of waters that do not bear any effect on the ``chemical, physical and biological integrity'' of any navigable-in-fact water. It went on further to state: The rule asserts jurisdiction over waters that are remote and intermittent waters. No evidence actually points to how these intermittent and remote wetlands have any nexus to navigable-in-fact water. That is the key. EPA has jurisdiction over navigable bodies of water, not ephemeral water that might be in a ditch today and gone tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a nationwide stay of the rule, in Cincinnati, citing that EPA and the Corps of Engineers did not identify ``specific scientific support substantiating the reasonableness of the bright-line standards they ultimately chose.'' To get a sense of the size of the Federal power grab we are talking about here, consider that under the administration's final rule, all water located within 4,000 feet of any other water or within the 100- year floodplain is considered a water of the United States as long as the EPA or the Army Corps of Engineers decides that it has ``significant nexus.'' That is the argument the EPA is making-- ``significant nexus.'' They are saying: Well, we can regulate navigable bodies of water. They just decided, without statutory authority provided by this Congress or any other authority, that because other waters run into navigable bodies, they can regulate all water, and they have issued a regulation to do that. The waters of the United States is clearly flawed from a legal perspective, but it is even more important to take a look at how this rule, if implemented, affects hard-working Americans with excessive regulations. For those of you who haven't had the opportunity to visit with a farmer from my State or any farmers across this country, do so. They will tell you how difficult it is to deal with excess water on their property, particularly when they face an overbearing regulation like this one. Those farmers can tell you that just because there is water in a ditch or field one week doesn't mean that there will be water there next week. It certainly doesn't make the water worthy of being treated the same as a river, a lake, or a navigable body of water. A field with a low spot that has standing water---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask that the Members of this body not only consider the underlying issue and the impact it will have on farmers and ranchers. It will also affect everybody's private property rights. I also ask my colleagues to consider their own prerogative. Under our Constitution we have legislative, judicial, and executive branches, and each has its own authority. We have to stand up on this one when an agency overreaches and takes statutory authority we have not provided. I ask that Members join with me in support of this vitally important amendment. With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following locking in the votes, the Senator from California have an opportunity to speak and then that we move to the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up the following amendments: Franken amendment No. 3833, Coats amendment No. 3814, and Murray amendment No. 3813; further, that following the disposition of the Hoeven amendment No. 3811, the Senate vote on the Coats amendment No. 3814, with a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption of the amendment; and that at 1:45 p.m. today, the Senate vote on the Franken amendment No. 3833; finally, that at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, April 25, the Senate vote on the Murray amendment No. 3813, with no second-degree amendments in order to any of the amendments prior to the votes, and that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote. May I say before the Senator from California speaks, I see the Senators from Michigan are here and the Senator from Indiana. I wish to thank the three of them for working with Senator Feinstein and me toward the goal of making sure that Senators who have a germane amendment have the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote. If we are able to follow that practice generally, we will be able to have an appropriations process and the Senate will function well. They all responded quickly and promptly on issues they feel very strongly about, and I thank them for it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from California. Amendment No. 3811 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words. The junior Senator from California has been speaking in opposition to the waters of the United States amendment sponsored by Senator Hoeven. I just want to put before the body a little bit of the history. In 2006 the Supreme Court introduced real uncertainty regarding which wetlands and water bodies were subject to Federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Since 2006 the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been working on new rules to clarify their jurisdiction and address the Supreme Court's ruling. EPA and the Army Corps just finalized the new rule last May. This new rule helps resolve almost a decade of confusion by clearly stating which types of water bodies are subject to Federal jurisdiction and which are not. It will make Federal permitting easier, faster, and less costly for business and industry. It maintains all previous exemptions and exclusions for normal farming and ranching practices and agricultural discharges, such as irrigation return flow and storm water runoff. Nevertheless, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has issued a stay suspending implementation of the rule. I strongly believe we should let the courts decide whether the executive branch has overreached in its interpretation of congressional statute, just like the Constitution calls for. The President has threatened to veto the entire Energy and Water appropriations bill if this amendment is included in it. Right now, we have the best opportunity in 7 years to pass this bill as a stand-alone piece of legislation and [[Page S2362]] get the Senate appropriations process working again. So I am very hopeful and would strongly recommend that the Senate defeat the Hoeven amendment. Thank you very much, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Hoeven amendment No. 3811. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in a moment Senator Coats will call up his amendment, the Coats and Toomey amendment. I want to thank the Michigan Senators and others for making the schedule work today. For the information of all Senators, after the Coats amendment, the next vote will be at 1:45 p.m. on the Franken amendment. That will be the last vote today. The next vote will be on the Murray amendment on Monday afternoon. Senators and their staffs have been very good about getting their amendments in. We think we have all the amendments. We have asked to have them by 1 p.m. so we could by consensus finish up on Monday and Tuesday, giving everybody a chance to have their vote if it is a germane amendment and to speak on the germane amendments. My request on behalf of Senator Feinstein and me is that if there are any amendments still out there, we would like to have them by 1 o'clock. Amendment No. 3814 to Amendment No. 3801 The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 3814, to be offered by the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Coats. Mr. COATS. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3814. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] proposes an amendment numbered 3814 to amendment No. 3801. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To limit the use of funds made available for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program) On page 30, line 9, strike the period at the end and insert the following: ``: Provided, That none of the funds made available under this heading shall be used to administer, review, or approve any loan or loan application that was not submitted as of the date of enactment of this Act: Provided further, that none of the funds available to the Secretary of Energy to provide any credit subsidy under subsection (d) of section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17013) as of the date of enactment of this Act shall be obligated for new loan commitments under that subsection on or after October 1, 2020.''. Mr. COATS. Madam President, 205 loans issued by the Department of Energy under the alternative vehicle program have failed, costing taxpayers $500 million in losses. DOE currently sits on $4 billion of unused money. It is time to wind down this program. This will not affect any proposals that are currently with the Department of Energy on this program, but it will prevent any new programs going forward. We can save the taxpayers a lot of money and use this for other alternatives if we adopt this amendment. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Pennsylvania. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, this is exactly the kind of program our constituents hate. It is the crony capitalism where taxpayers are forced to subsidize preferred companies, special interests. How many hundreds of millions of dollars do taxpayers have to lose? I understand there is some discussion that maybe on some bill in the future, this will get phased out as part of another deal, but who knows if that is ever going to happen. Here is a chance to wipe out some crony capitalism, some corporate welfare, and a huge loss for taxpayers. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. TOOMEY. Let's adopt this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I would certainly urge all of my colleagues to oppose the Coats amendment. What this does is eliminate a program that basically pays for a very carefully crafted agreement on which we are working to deal with the Flint water issue, as well as water infrastructure issues all across this country. This is part of the proposal Senator Stabenow and I have been working on and have been building support. We are looking to move to this very shortly to deal with this broad issue. A vote against this amendment allows us to continue to move forward with a bipartisan plan, critical for our whole country. I yield my remaining time to the senior Senator from Michigan. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, the bottom line is that we have developed a bipartisan bill that phases out this program in a responsible way for the businesses that are currently involved and uses that to pay for water infrastructure needs across the country, not only in Flint but in Jackson, MI, and Cleveland, OH--across the country. So we can achieve what the Senators are talking about in a way that helps us with water infrastructure. I urge a ``no'' vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3814. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 49, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 58 Leg.] YEAS--48 Ayotte Barrasso Boozman Burr Capito Coats Cochran Collins Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner [[Page S2363]] Graham Grassley Hatch Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kirk Lankford Lee McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Paul Perdue Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Wicker NAYS--49 Alexander Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coons Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Kaine King Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murkowski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Portman Reed Reid Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wyden NOT VOTING--3 Blunt Cruz Sanders The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. The Senator from Arizona. Tribute to Sandy Ledy Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Sandy Ledy, a dedicated Senate staff member who will retire after more than two decades of public service in my office. Soon after being elected to the Senate in 1994, Senator John Kyl was wise enough to offer Sandy--a standout campaign volunteer--a job on his new staff. Sandy was given two options: She could work as a staffer in Washington, DC, or she could serve in Arizona and serve as John Kyl's military case worker. Sandy knew she couldn't pass up an opportunity to serve those who serve our Nation. It was an easy decision for Sandy and a fortuitous one for Arizona's military servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Sandy's genuine passion for our military service men and women, combined with her meticulous approach to her work, has made her an invaluable staffer. Sandy is well-versed in all things military, from regulations, to benefits, to the service academies. Her vast knowledge has ensured that Arizona's military service men and women have had nothing but the best assistance for more than the past two decades. Her reputation preceded her, and when I was elected as Senator in 2012, I had an easy decision of my own--offering Sandy a job on my staff. Thankfully, she said yes. Sandy is probably best known around the State as the point person for service academy nominations. Her understanding of that process and what it takes for a student to be an excellent nominee has helped so many students fulfill their dreams of attending one of our prestigious service academies. Her focus on preparation and attention to detail has turned what can be a very daunting task into a seamless production, resulting in countless nominations and appointments to the service academies. While we all marvel at Sandy's meticulousness, it is her compassion and calm demeanor that make her such an asset. This is never more evident than when she is working with students and parents in the long and complicated process of applying to attend one of these service academies. Beyond her work on behalf of the military, she is an active and cherished member of her community in Cave Creek, AZ. She is a member of her church choir, a regular volunteer at the Cave Creek Museum, and a longtime swim coach, sometimes judging local meets. But there is no better testament to Sandy's example as a public servant than her two children, Amy and Joe. Amy is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy who herself recently retired after a career in the military. Joe served in the U.S. Marine Corps. They have made her the proud grandmother of three, and she is looking forward to spending a well-deserved retirement looking after those grandkids. Sandy, thank you for more than 20 years of dedicated public service in the Senate and, in particular, for the 4 years of stellar service as a member of my staff. Your knowledge and passion will be greatly missed. I wish you well in your retirement. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am on the floor with my colleague Senator Portman to join him in urging the House to take prompt action on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which passed with such a stunning bipartisan vote in the Senate. As Senator Portman has pointed out, years of careful preparation went into the drafting of this bill. There were five separate national hearings held in Washington with people from all over the country. This is a very polished and carefully developed piece of legislative work that has the support not only of the addiction and recovery community but of the law enforcement community and many others. Senator Portman has been very diligent about coming to the floor to press for action from the House of Representatives. My view is that since the House of Representatives is under Republican control, they are more likely to be attentive to the urgings of a Republican Senator--particularly one who has served in the House of Representatives--than they are to me. But I want to make sure the record is clear that I fully support rapid passage of this bill, whether it is something that is close enough that we can quickly get it through conference or whether it is our bill, to which they are free to add things as they wish over time, but can get to the President now--the reason I think it is important that it get to the President now is we are in the appropriations process. The appropriators for these accounts need to know what they are appropriating to. So time is of the essence, not just because of the lives that are being lost day-to-day and month-to-month out there but also because our appropriators need to know. I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives, Democrats and Republicans alike, to listen to the distinguished Senator from Ohio. Let's try to get this done. With that, I yield to Senator Portman with my thanks and appreciation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. First, Madam President, I want to thank my colleague from Rhode Island who just spoke. We did work together for the past few years in putting together this legislation, and we did it, by the way, with the House of Representatives. So Senator Whitehouse and I took good ideas wherever we could find them, in whatever part of the country it came from, including ideas from the House of Representatives. We didn't ask who had the idea; we asked whether it was a good idea. We kept this entirely nonpartisan, not just bipartisan. Therefore, we built something that makes sense for our communities back home to deal with this epidemic of prescription drug and heroin addiction and overdoses. I appreciate his partnership in this, and I appreciate the fact that he came to the floor today to talk about the importance of moving ahead with this legislation. After all, it is very rare around here to get a 94-to-1 vote on anything, and we did it on this bill. After 2\1/2\ weeks on the floor of the Senate talking about this heroin and prescription drug epidemic, every single Senator here realized this was a problem in their States, and 94 Senators stood up and agreed this legislation will help address it. By the way, since we passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, as it is called, on March 10 in the Senate, 42 days have passed. That is more than a month. Every day, we lose about 120 Americans--120 Americans--to drug overdoses. That means in these 42 days we have lost over 5,000 fellow American citizens to drug overdoses. Think about that. I do urge the House to act and act quickly. These numbers keep getting higher and higher. This is not getting better. Back in Ohio, this is getting worse, and I assume the same is true in your State, if you are a Senator or if you are a Member of the House of Representatives in your district. Since 2007, we have looked at these numbers, and drug overdoses have killed more Ohioans than car accidents. It is now the No. 1 cause of accidental death in Ohio. It has tripled [[Page S2364]] from 1999 to 2010. We are now told, by the way, that 200,000 Ohioans are addicted to opioids--opioids are prescription drugs--and heroin-- 200,000 Ohioans. That is the size of a significant city in any State represented here in this body or any district on the other side. In fact, it is the same size as the city of Akron, OH, where I was on Monday of this week, meeting with their opioid task force. They are alarmed at what is happening, and they want to be sure we are making every possible effort we can on the prevention side, the education side, to get more people into treatment, to get them into longer term recovery, to provide police officers and other first responders with Narcan, the miracle drug they need to stop overdoses from turning into a death. They want our help. They support the CARA legislation. They need it, and they need it now. The Cincinnati Enquirer had some really troubling news last week. They wrote a story about a new poll that is out. It is a group called Interact for Health. They do an annual Ohio health issues poll. They found in the poll in 2014 that 2 of every 10 Ohioans knew someone who was abusing prescription drugs. A year later, it is 3 in 10, so this is not getting better. This is getting worse. By the way, this is just prescription drugs. And by the way, of the 3 in 10 who knew somebody who is abusing prescription drugs, 4 in 10--4 in 10--knew somebody who had overdosed on those prescription drugs. So these percentages are increasing across the board--every age group, every education level, every income level. There is no demographic, no ZIP Code, no State, no city, and no county that is safe from this epidemic. It is spreading, and it is spreading everywhere. This poll is another indication that we have a lot of work to do. This should be a motivation for us. This should get us to pass this legislation. And, yes, can we work on additional legislation? Of course, we can and should. I am encouraged that the House is taking up new bills and looking at this in different ways. That is good. But we know here in the Senate and over in the House that this CARA legislation will help and will help now. By the way, there are over 120 cosponsors of the CARA legislation in the House. Not only did we work with them and introduce identical legislation in the House and the Senate, anticipating this day when we could pass it in one House, but we wanted to pass it quickly in the other House and get it to the President for his signature. There are over 120 cosponsors over there. It is bipartisan. Think of the impact we could have on the community if we could get this passed. If we could turn around just one life, it matters, and we know this can save many lives and make many people begin to look at this issue differently--that this is a disease. Addiction is a disease and needs to be treated as such. Removing some of that stigma alone will bring a lot more people into treatment, and that is part of what is important about this legislation. There is another issue that is not prescription drugs, and it is not heroin, but it is another issue related to it, and that is fentanyl. Fentanyl is being laced with heroin throughout the country. In Cleveland, OH, a couple of weeks ago, we lost 12 people--12 people--in 6 days to overdoses. That is one city. This was heroin, but it was laced with this even more dangerous toxic substance called fentanyl. By the way, it comes in the mail. The drug dealers are shipping it in the mail. Fentanyl is so toxic--10 to 30 to 40 times more toxic than heroin-- that it is dangerous even to open up the mail if you are an inspector, we are told. We had a hearing on this just this week. We talked to the Customs and Border Patrol people: Our question was, Why can't we stop this stuff from coming in? This, unfortunately, is something that is also increasing. Ohio, they say, is one of the top States in the country in terms of fentanyl overdoses. But I will tell those who have not dealt with this fentanyl issue yet that it creates even more issues because it is so deadly. After 3 years of work on this CARA legislation, Senator Whitehouse and I and others, including Senators on both sides of the aisle--we did hold five forums, as he said, on various aspects of this debate. We consulted with the experts on treatment and recovery, the experts who are focused on how to keep kids and other people from making these bad decisions in the prevention and the education community. We met with the drug experts from the administration, such as the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. We brought in people from all over the country, including from my home State of Ohio. This is the third time I have come to the floor. I have come once every week that we have been in session since we passed it to say to the House: Let's move on CARA. Let's get it done. It will help immediately. The majority leader in the House has said he wants the House to take on the drug epidemic and pass legislation soon. I believe him. He is a good man. I appreciate that. But I would ask him again to please work on the other legislation. It is fine to take them through hearings and markups, but we cannot delay. We know CARA will work, and it will work now. It is sitting over there and ready for action. It can be taken to the floor immediately under suspension and can be passed. We are one vote away from having this go to the President and having it go to help in our communities. The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Fred Upton, who is a good friend and a man with a big heart and cares about this issue, has said he would like the House to move quickly with, as he said, an ``all hands on deck effort.'' Good for him. One of his subcommittees, the Health Subcommittee, recently marked up a dozen bills. This happened yesterday; they marked up 12 bills. Look at those bills. A number of them are actually a part of CARA already. They are in CARA. They are smaller bills. None of them is comprehensive, like CARA. One reason we have to get CARA passed is this is a problem that has to be addressed from all angles, from all sectors, and that is why it has to be comprehensive. But of those 12 bills that were marked up yesterday, many of them are identical, and others are very similar to the CARA legislation. So this shouldn't slow us down. In fact, it is even more an indication that if these are the kinds of bills the House thinks are the right way to go, let's get CARA passed and then we can work on the other legislative ideas Members may have. I respect my colleagues--Chairman Upton, the majority leader over there, and Chairman Pence, the chairman of the subcommittee and also a guy who cares a lot about this issue--but let's give CARA a vote. There are 125 cosponsors. That is the latest number I have as of this morning, and the number keeps growing. It is bipartisan, it is bicameral, and it is the right thing to do. Again, I know there are other ideas out there, and that is fine. We need to take those up as well. But let's go ahead and get this passed. Put it under suspension, and take it to the floor. It will pass. We are one vote away from having this help our communities. CARA is not just comprehensive; it does the right thing in terms of focusing on what is evidence based. In other words, we didn't just say ``Let's throw more money at this problem,'' we said ``Let's actually find out what is working and what is not working.'' I was in Dayton, OH, with a group called Project C.U.R.E. on Friday. I had the chance to visit with some of the administrators there, some of the recovery coaches, as they call themselves, many of whom, by the way, are recovering themselves. They are doing an amazing job. I talked to many of the patients who were there. They are people who are recovering addicts. Some have been clean for 2 weeks, some clean for 2 years. But I asked them the same question I ask all over our State: What works? What doesn't work? How did this happen? Most of them, by the way, told me the same story you hear time and again: It started with prescription drugs. In fact, one story was from a man by the name of Anthony. He dropped out of high school at age 14, got into drugs, and made some mistakes in his life, which he readily acknowledges. He ended up in prison. He said he had eight convictions and was in and out of prison, in and out of the drug world. He decided to go straight. [[Page S2365]] He made a decision. For him, a lot of it was faith based and a lot was being sure he was going to be able to take care of his family and be a contributing member of his community, so he gave back. Anthony had a good job, had gotten married, and was on the right track. He was on his way to work one day, and he was in a car accident. For those experts who are listening to this today, you probably know happened. I don't even have to tell you. When he got in the car accident, he was injured. They sent him to the hospital. What did they give him at the hospital? Narcotic pain pills, Percocet, prescription drugs. Immediately--immediately--Anthony became addicted again. He is now struggling, but he is back at the treatment center. He is getting his life back together again. But in the meantime he has lost his family because the drugs became everything. He lost his job because the drugs became everything. We talk a lot about the overdoses, and they are horrible--120 Americans a day. We don't talk enough about those who aren't overdosing but who have lost their ability to achieve their own God-given purpose in life because the drugs are everything. So they have lost their families--torn apart. They have lost their jobs. They have lost their ability to be contributing members of our society. And those people who get into treatment and longer term recovery, as Anthony is doing, can turn their lives around. There is hope. It can work. Anthony is back for a second chance. Having talked to him, I believe he is not just on the right track but he will work through this. This legislation is needed to help him. When I do meet with recovering addicts, I ask them to look at the legislation, look at the summaries, and tell me what they think. What they tell me is they like it because they are convinced it would help others to have the access to treatment they have. Probably only 1 out of 10 of those people who are addicted are getting treatment. That is the best number I have. Maybe it is a little higher than that in your State or congressional district, but this is an issue where, if we provide more resources for treatment and begin to remove that stigma around treatment and get more people into a system where they can begin to get their lives back together with treatment, we know that works. Our legislation supports veterans task forces and veterans courts because we know this will help with our veterans who are coming back with PTSD, 20 percent of whom have this addiction. People say it is self-medicating. They have self-medicated to the point that they are now addicts. We need to put them not into a prison cell but into a treatment program. That is what these veterans courts do, and they surround these veterans with other veterans. They do an awesome job. I have been to them in Ohio. You have them probably in your State. If you don't, this legislation will help because it creates more veterans courts. We have talked on the floor before about the fact that there has been a huge increase--a 750 percent increase in the State of Ohio--in babies born with addiction. That is just in the last 12 years in Ohio. Go to any neonatal unit in your State or congressional district, and you will see these babies. They are being lovingly cared for by doctors and nurses. They are taking these addicted babies you could hold in the palm of your hand, and they are literally taking them through withdrawal. They have to because these babies are addicted and showing the symptoms you might see in an adult of addiction. We don't know what the long-term consequences are. We are having a hearing on this tomorrow in Cleveland, OH, at one of our great hospitals--University Hospitals Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital. It is one of the best children's hospitals in the country. Their neonatal unit is doing awesome work. I have been there and seen it. We are going to talk to the experts about this and how we can do even better to help these babies. But wouldn't it be great if we didn't have so many babies born with addiction because mothers, knowing the consequences, dealt with their addiction problem to avoid it through prevention and education efforts? Wouldn't it be great if we didn't have this 750-percent increase in children whose futures are uncertain because of being born with this addiction? Again, there is hope. I have been to a women's recovery center in Cleveland and Columbus and also in Eastern Ohio and Athens, OH, where I have met with women in long-term recovery with drug addiction. They are there with their kids. There is hope. With this legislation, we do have the ability to give people more hope. Getting rid of that stigma, not judging people, is part of beating this epidemic, and CARA will do that by treating addiction like a disease. There is an opportunity for us to move, and move quickly, to address this growing crisis we have in our States and our communities; that is, to pass this CARA legislation. Is it all we should do? No. Of course we should do more. I know the House of Representatives will have some great ideas. I know there are some great ideas in this body. The HELP Committee is working on additional ideas on how to get more medicine into this area of addiction, science, and treatment. They are working on ways to ensure that we can provide more help to people. That is great, and we should continue to work on that. Meanwhile, we know this legislation will help. We know that if it is sitting on the desk in the House of Representatives, having passed the Senate by a 94-to-1 vote, it is not going to help. But we know if it can get off the desk and onto the floor for a vote, we are one vote away from getting it to our communities to begin to help, to keep people from making the wrong decision--but then if they get into a drug addiction, it can help them to be able to turn their lives around and to achieve their potential in life, their God-given potential. That is what this argument is about. It is not about the fact that the Senate has all the answers. By the way, we wrote this legislation with the House. They were engaged from the start. We introduced identical bills and they had 125 cosponsors. All we are saying is, let's let this one piece of legislation go, let's allow it to begin to help right away, and then let's continue to work on other ideas. Again, we have lost nearly 5,000 Americans to drug overdoses since the Senate passed CARA with a 94-to-1 vote. To begin to reverse this tide--this trend of addiction, of overdoses--we can and should act now. It is urgent. There is a crisis. There is no time to waste. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wish to thank my friend for his comments about addiction. I agree with the Senator from Ohio, talking about the victims from Ohio. I can assure him we have victims in Virginia and all across the country, and we need to get this legislation to the President's desk so people who are hurt by the scourge of drugs can get the treatment they need. Again, I thank him for his leadership. Nomination of Merrick Garland Madam President, I rise to again express my disappointment that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have continued to obstruct consideration of an eminently qualified candidate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. It has now been 36 days since President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland; that is, 36 days that our highest Court has been relegated to falling short of its full constitutional obligations. Make no mistake. The Senate's inaction is already having a tangible impact on the Court's ability to function effectively. During the current session, we have seen our eight current Justices end up in a 4-to-4 deadlock in three separate cases since Justice Scalia's passing--effectively muting the Court's voice in consequential judicial proceedings. President Reagan himself said: ``Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' More recently, retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor put it quite simply, as she always does. She said: ``I think we need somebody there now to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' Indeed, the Supreme Court has granted only three cases since Justice Scalia [[Page S2366]] died--a number experts say is extraordinarily low and an indication that the eight sitting Justices are acutely aware of the precarious position the Court is in with a vacancy. Many Senators apparently believe that President Obama shouldn't be able to make appointments under article II because he is in the last year of his term. The record shows there is nothing in the Constitution that says the President is only President for 3 of the 4 years of his or her term. I don't understand that reasoning. Under that reasoning, any of those same Senators who have made that argument shouldn't be voting on any bill that comes before this body in the last year of their Senate term. If we continue with that rationale, the President's office and the Senate would lead to further dysfunction. Quite honestly, that logic is beyond the pale. It is clear as well that the American people expect us to do our job. Recent polls show that by a 2-to-1 margin Americans want the Senate to hold hearings and vote on Judge Garland's nomination. That is why I remain so perplexed by the logical contortions that many of my colleagues are undertaking to justify their obstruction and quite honestly their failure to do their job. I had the chance to meet with Judge Garland last week. His qualifications and dedication to public service are beyond reproach. He has received strong bipartisan support in the past, but what also stood out to me are his measured view of the role of the judiciary, his strong record on national security, and commitment to keeping our country safe. This past Tuesday marked the 21st anniversary of the bombing of a Federal building in Oklahoma City. On that tragic day in 1995, 168 people, including 19 children, lost their lives. To this day, the Oklahoma City bombing remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in our Nation's history. Judge Garland at that time was Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General. He was the guy who led the criminal investigation and supervised the prosecution of the bombers. Merrick Garland fought for justice for the victims and the families in Oklahoma City. Through his tireless efforts, deep understanding of the law, and attention to detail, he ensured that the prosecution had an airtight case. Ultimately, both bombers were successfully convicted. This is the highest profile instance in which Judge Garland exhibited his commitment to making and keeping our country safe, but it is far from the only one. In my meeting with him, it was clear that the safety and security of our citizens is an issue that quite honestly keeps him up at night. What also stands out about my conversation with Judge Garland is his sense of humility. Our conversation and his judicial record demonstrate to me that he is a moderate, thoughtful, consensus candidate. As Judge Garland said in the Rose Garden on the day he was nominated: People must be confident that a judge's decisions are determined by the law and only the law. For a judge to be worthy of such trust, he or she must be faithful to the Constitution, and to the statutes passed by Congress. He or she must put aside his personal views or preferences and follow the law; not make it. Fidelity to the Constitution and the law has been the cornerstone of my professional life, and is the hallmark of the kind of judge I have tried to be for the past 18 years. These are not the words nor the track record of a judicial activist. In my opinion, this is the kind of judge that Merrick Garland has been: not a judicial activist but someone who recognizes the important role and the important balance between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. I am encouraged that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have at least begun to give Judge Garland the courtesy of a meeting, but meetings alone are not sufficient. The American people deserve the opportunity to hear Judge Garland's qualifications debated in a public hearing in the Judiciary Committee, and they deserve an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. That is all we ask. I again urge my colleagues to give Judge Garland the consideration other nominees have received. At the end of the day, if they choose to vote against him, that is their right, but the idea that somehow they are interpreting the Constitution to say that in the last year of a Presidency a qualified judge should not even receive consideration of a hearing and a vote is quite honestly beyond the pale. Too often these debates end up going on and become extraordinarily complicated. In many ways, what I hear from Virginians--regardless of whether they want me to support Judge Garland--is a very simple message: Do your job. In the coming days and weeks, I hope the Senate will do its job and give Judge Garland the consideration of a hearing before the Judiciary Committee and then take up this eminently qualified jurist's nomination on the floor and give him the vote he deserves. I yield the floor. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Paris Climate Agreement Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to recognize the importance of the signing of the Paris Agreement. Tomorrow marks the 46th anniversary of Earth Day--the first Earth Day--the Earth Day that occurred when I was in seventh grade. My seventh grade teacher made a point of making sure all the students were aware of it. They made sure we had a chance to do a field trip to the community college to learn about some of the issues related to stewardship of the planet. It is a day to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of our blue-green planet but also to recognize, to remind ourselves of the fact that we have a huge responsibility to be good stewards of the wonderful planet we have. It was Theodore Roosevelt who said that ``our greatest central task [is] leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us.'' That is the definition of stewardship, and that is what Earth Day is all about. This is why it is so fitting that tomorrow, on Earth Day, America will join other nations in signing the Paris Agreement. This international climate accord is a tremendous step forward. It makes clear the world recognizes that global warming is a very significant and grave concern facing human civilization on this planet. It is, indeed, the moral challenge of our generation. I am proud and inspired by the global community's unprecedented commitment to avert global warming, to avert a climate crisis. We know what the stakes are. We don't need computer models to look 50 years into the future because the impacts are here today. We see it in our own communities. We see it in our own States. We see it through the impact of droughts, the impact of wildfires, the impact of heat waves, the storms, the hurricanes, the tornadoes. We see it through story after story of this year or this month being the warmest ever recorded by humans. These events have profound costs that can be measured in lost lives, lost homes, lost businesses, billions of dollars in disaster relief. It is important to understand that global warming's major assault is on our rural communities, on our farming, our fishing, and our forestry. You can see it across the world. You can see it across the country. You can see it just inside my home State of Oregon. We have had significant droughts greatly impacting our agricultural community in my State. We have had a loss of snowpack in the Cascades, a trend over decades impacting the availability of water for irrigation in farming. We have seen the impact on fishing, with streams that are warmer and smaller than they were in the past. We have seen it on our oyster population on the coast, where now the oysters are having trouble reproducing because the Pacific Ocean is 30 percent more acidic than it was before we started burning fossil fuels on this planet. That greater acidity is affecting the ability of baby oysters to form shells. That should frighten us all--the ability of shellfish to form shells being threatened. It is hard to imagine that we have burned enough fossil fuels to actually [[Page S2367]] impact the acidity of the oceans. But we have, and the problem is getting worse. We see the impact on our forests. We see it in my home State of Oregon through the red zone. That is the term given to the vast swaths of forests that have been killed by pine beetles because the winters now are not cold enough to kill off the pine beetle. So the infestations are much more aggressive, much more widespread. We see the impact on our forests from more vigorous wildfires and a longer forest fire season--a season that has grown by 60 days over 40 years. That is 2 months. In fact, we have even had forest fires in Oregon in the month of January. It is a huge loss, a huge impact on the ecosystem, and a huge impact on the economy. If you care about rural America and our farming, our fishing, and our forestry, you must care about carbon pollution and global warming. Scientists agree that we must keep the warming of our planet under 2 degrees Celsius in order to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change--impacts much worse than what we are seeing now. But we have already warmed the planet by 1 degree. So we are halfway toward that boundary, which is why an important component of the Paris agreement is not just the substance of the agreement itself but also a compact that the international community will revisit every 5 years, because the measures taken in the Paris agreement are not enough to fend off catastrophe. What they do represent is virtually every nation in the world coming together and saying we understand the challenge to our planet, and we understand that we must be part of the solution. To have more heads of state come together in December for the Paris agreement than at any other time in human history is very impressive. But the commitments made, even if they are fully fulfilled, don't go far enough. We are going to have to come back together every 5 years to add to our understanding and to increase the speed with which we are pivoting from fossil fuels to renewable fuels. At those 5-year gatherings, we will strengthen our pledges, we will work to reduce the emissions even further, and we will review the changing technologies. There is so much investment going on. There is a program called Mission Innovation, which is a number of countries coming together, private companies coming together, and foundations coming together to develop the best ideas--out-of-the-box ideas--to be able to take on the challenge of global warming. Those technologies are going to be a key part of accelerating our ability to tackle this challenge. We have to keep working to drive down the cost curve on renewable energy so that it makes a positive contribution to our economy in every possible way, lowering the cost of power while at the same time putting thousands or, in some technologies, millions of individuals to work. We have to make sure developing countries can afford these options in solar, wind, and other renewable strategies. Together, we must invest in paradigm-shifting technology. One of those might be battery storage, to make better use of solar energy when the solar energy exceeds current demand, or to capture wind energy when the wind is blowing strongly and our wind turbines are producing more than the current demand. It means we have to do things such as investing in a broader grid to ship those amps of electricity around the country--those watts of energy around the country. Here at home, we can't keep up business as usual. If we need to pivot from fossil fuels to renewables, then we shouldn't keep subsidizing fossil fuels. We can't keep drilling oil offshore and opening up drilling in new places like the Arctic. The Arctic nation should come together and reach a pact not to drill in the Arctic and to put it off-limits. As American citizens, you and I own a lot of oil, a lot of coal, and we must recognize that we need to keep those fossil fuels that we own in the ground because here is the size of the problem. For us to succeed in keeping the temperature of our planet below 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial age, we have to leave 80 percent of the identified proven fossil fuel reserves in the world in the ground. If we are going to do that, then it makes no sense at all--for what you and I own as citizens--to be pulling it out of the ground. It makes no sense to be doing contracts today--leases--that provide a legal contract for extraction of our coal, our oil, and our gas, which you and I own as citizens, three decades, four decades, or five decades into the future--long after the world has to have pivoted off of fossil fuels. It is said that when you are in a hole, stop digging. In this case, we are in a carbon pollution hole, and we need to stop digging fossil fuels out of the ground. Instead, we must seize the opportunity to invest in the infrastructure of the future, to spur a clean energy revolution, and to build a green economy creating living-wage jobs. It has been said that we are the first generation to feel the impact of global warming, and we are the last generation that can do something about it. That is a huge responsibility. The signing of this agreement consists of doing something about it, something major about it, something important about it, something that all the Nations in the world have come together to do together to take this on and to recognize our collective responsibility. It is a breakthrough moment in the fight-- the international fight, the human civilization fight--to take on this moral, major challenge to our planet. While this deal is by no means the end of the work we must do, having the global community come together around a vision of action is a huge milestone in the path to averting climate catastrophe. This agreement should only strengthen our Nation's resolve to build a sustainable future, to protect our beautiful blue-green planet, and to work harder to fight climate change not just on Earth Day but every day of the year. In fact, this agreement is very much central to the task that Theodore Roosevelt put before us: to leave our land a better land for our descendants than it is for us. Let's get to work. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3833 to Amendment No. 3801 Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3833. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Minnesota, [Mr. Franken] proposes an amendment numbered 3833 to amendment No. 3801. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To provide funding for the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program) On page 29, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following: Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program For the cost of loan guarantees provided under section 2602(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (25 U.S.C. 3502(c)), $8,500,000, to remain available until expended: Provided, That the cost of those loan guarantees (including the costs of modifying loans, as applicable) shall be determined in accordance with section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 661a): Provided further, That, for necessary administrative expenses to carry out that program, $500,000 is appropriated, to remain available until expended: Provided further, That, of the subsidy amounts provided by section 1425 of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (Public Law 112-10; 125 Stat. 126), for the cost of loan guarantees for renewable energy or efficient end-use energy technologies under section 1703 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16513), $9,000,000 is permanently canceled. Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, Federal programs in Indian Country are chronically underfunded. I have served on the Indian Affairs Committee for the past 7 years, and I have been shocked by what I hear almost every week from tribal leaders about the challenges in Indian Country. Tribes struggle with crumbling schools, dilapidated roads, lack of housing, and lack of basic infrastructure. Many of the crises we hear about in Indian Country come from lack of opportunity, lack of hope. Indian youth have the highest rate of suicide among all ethnic groups in the United States. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for Native youth aged 15 to 24. The Indian suicide rate is 62 percent higher than it is for [[Page S2368]] the general population. Unemployment on Indian reservations averages 19 percent, and on some reservations it is above 50 percent. Senators Murkowski, Heitkamp, and Udall understand the dire needs of Indian Country, which is why they have cosponsored my amendment. Chairman Barrasso also understands the needs of Indian Country, and that is why he also supports this amendment. They understand that we have to support economic development for tribes whenever we can. My amendment sets aside $9 million, which can be leveraged into about $50 to $85 million worth of loans for energy projects in Indian Country. Developing tribal energy resources will help tribes bring power to the most remote parts of Indian Country--improving access to reliable and resilient energy and providing much needed jobs. That is why Congress authorized the loan program in the Energy Policy Act of 2005--to help tribes access the capital they need for energy projects. But this program has never received funding. My amendment doesn't cost anything. We are simply putting $9 million of already-appropriated money toward a new use. I thank Senators Heitkamp, Udall, and Murkowski for cosponsoring my amendment. I thank Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Feinstein for their leadership. Finally, I thank Secretary Moniz, who has been a champion for this program. I urge my colleagues to support Franken amendment No. 3833 to bring jobs to Indian Country. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank Senator Franken for the way he worked with our committee. I will vote for the amendment, and I recommend that others do as well. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3833. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced---yeas 76, nays 19, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 59 Leg.] YEAS---76 Alexander Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Crapo Daines Donnelly Enzi Feinstein Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Kaine King Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill Menendez Merkley Mikulski Moran Murkowski Murray Nelson Peters Reed Reid Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Toomey Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS---19 Ayotte Boozman Cotton Ernst Fischer Johnson Kirk Lankford Lee McConnell Paul Perdue Portman Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Tillis Vitter NOT VOTING---5 Blunt Cruz Durbin Murphy Sanders The amendment (No. 3833) was agreed to. vote explanation Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from this afternoon's vote on Franken amendment No. 3833, which was adopted to the pending business--Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, H.R. 2028. On rollcall vote No. 59, had I been present, I would have voted to support the amendment. Senator Franken's amendment will further strengthen the deployment of clean energy by creating a Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program to fund energy projects in Indian Country. This amendment will help Indian tribes access much needed financing as they seek to develop energy projects and create well-paying jobs. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee to express my appreciation to the majority leader of the Senate, Senator McConnell, and Senator Cochran, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, for moving the process forward. We have on the floor today the Energy and Water Committee bill. This is the first bill of the Appropriations Committee to come to the floor. It signals that we are ready to do regular order. I so appreciate the leaderships' commitment to do that, so we don't end up with a big omnibus bill at the end. Every bill comes, they can be amended, and everyone can have their day and their say. It is an excellent kickoff to what I hope will be the ability to move all 12 bills and some crucial, urgent supplementals. I also compliment Senators Alexander and Senator Feinstein for the excellent job they have done on this particular subcommittee. They have followed the bipartisan agreement. They have a bill that is free of poison pill riders. When you look at what they have done in terms of energy and water, it is an excellent bill from the standpoint of national security and economic development, whether it is the funding for the Army Corps of Engineers that is so important to those of us who have ports, to science in terms of our fields of energy. We win Nobel prizes, but we need to win the markets. It has an excellent approach in terms of tech transfer. Maryland benefits from this bill. It provides over $100 million for the Port of Baltimore. That is going to support the port's nearly 14,000 jobs and a tax base of over $300 million. The Port of Baltimore has always been the gateway to Ohio and the West. First, supported by the B&O--Baltimore and Ohio--Railroad and now CSX. Funding in this bill dredges the port's 50-foot channel, making it ready for megacontainer ships coming through the expanded Panama Canal and supporting the port's competitive edge over its East Coast competition. The bill also funds construction of Poplar Island, where clean dredge material is rebuilding the natural ecosystem of a former Chesapeake Bay island. This bill exceeds the target level for the harbor maintenance trust fund, providing approximately $1.3 billion. Dredging is the primary activity of the trust fund. This funding is knocking out the nationwide backlog of dredging projects, supporting the U.S. economy and local economies. Across Maryland, this bill makes critical investments, protecting Assateague Island, a national seaside treasure, for future generations, protecting Cumberland from flooding, and protecting this area's water supply at the Jennings Randolph Lake in Garrett County. This bill also supports a unique public-private partnership between the U.S. Department of Energy and commercial truck manufacturers. Together, they are developing the next generation of fuel-efficient heavy-duty trucks. Total funding is $20 million. Volvo has been a partner and is competing again for a portion of this funding. Its Hagerstown, MD plant produces Mack Trucks with 1,600 jobs. Their talented professionals have been leaders on truck engine research and development, discovering technologies to reduce oil consumption and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. For the Appalachian Regional Commission, this bill provides $75 million for the base program, an increase of $5 million. The commission meets both physical and human infrastructure needs. This is a hands- across-the-aisle program that all Appalachia Senators support. There are 13 States in the commission. [[Page S2369]] Maryland has three counties in the commission: Washington, Allegany, and Garrett. Maryland's mountain counties receive nearly $5 million annually, making investments to rebound from lost manufacturing jobs. The recession was another setback. Now, through their community colleges, they are retraining and retooling their residents. The commission's grants, matched with local and other Federal funding, are making a big difference. I recently visited Garrett College where I announced two grants. The first was to establish new allied health programs with a simulation manikin. This was a grant award for $110,000. The second grant was to buy Westernport a new water tank. This grant for $400,000 was matched with $2.4 million in other Federal loans and grants. It means more capacity for Westernport, new service to nearby towns of Luke and Bloomington, and a huge cost savings to Luke Mill. The paper mill has been supplying drinking water to the town of Luke. This grant is protecting the 880 employees at Luke Mill and 3,000 regional jobs in timber and trucking. If this is the way it is going to be to move appropriations, I think it is a good day. It is not only a good bill, but it shows when the Senate practices the ability to work together to bring legislation to the floor, to follow regular order, we can get our job done. It can be open, it can be transparent, and we can have amendments. I so look forward to this being the tone and the tempo of the rest of the appropriations season. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas. National Park Week Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, this week I encourage Arkansans and all Americans to take a moment and enjoy your local national parks as we celebrate National Park Week 2016. This year National Park Week is particularly important because it also happens to be the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service, a milestone we will celebrate all year long. For those of you who don't know, our National Park System began in 1872 with the establishment of Yellowstone National Park. The organization charged with managing these parks, the National Park Service, was established four decades later in 1916. Today we have over 400 national parks and historic sites around the country, all full of wildlife, beautiful landscapes, and rich culture. These sites are all cared for by over 20,000 dedicated employees of the National Park Service, including park rangers who patrol our parks and keep visitors safe. Arkansas is home to several national parks and national historic sites, some of the prettiest and most interesting in the country, in my opinion. For those of you who have not been to Arkansas, I encourage you to visit Hot Springs National Park to see our natural springs and thermal pools. If you are a history buff, you can visit Arkansas Post, the site of the only Revolutionary War activity in the State of Arkansas. If you are into the outdoors, you can float the Buffalo River. The list goes on. Each of the national parks and historic sites in Arkansas and around the country has its own unique appeal and holds its own adventure. So happy National Park Week and happy 100th birthday to the National Park Service. I encourage everyone to take advantage of free admission to all national parks in Arkansas and across the country through this Sunday, April 24. Have a little fun, learn a little bit about your great country, and show your support and thanks for the men and women who serve us in the national parks. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to complete this speech. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Corporate Inversions Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, over the past couple of years I have spoken numerous times on corporate inversions, the problems they cause, and various proposed solutions. I wish to take a few minutes today to comment on some of the recent developments with regard to this important issue. Inversions are a matter of great concern in our country. This is true among members of both parties, both in and out of government. As the chairman of the Senate's tax-writing committee, I have to say that for years now, most major discussions I have had on tax policy and reform with various private sector stakeholders eventually end up focusing on inversions. Virtually everyone acknowledges that inversions are a problem. When a U.S. company reidentifies itself as a foreign entity and moves its tax headquarters overseas, it shrinks our tax base. It means lost investment and growth for our country and a further demonstration of the failure of the government to create a tax environment in this country that allows businesses to flourish, create jobs, and, of course, help grow our economy. As I said, members of both parties see inversions as a problem, one that needs fixing. Sadly, the debate surrounding this national issue has too often become mired in politics and partisanship, which thus far has prevented Congress from making any real progress. Some in Washington--in the Capitol and on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue--would rather talk about inversions than solve the problem. When a wave of U.S. companies announce that they are merging with other entities and moving their headquarters offshore, the strategy seems to be to publicly attack those companies; accuse them of, among other things, lacking ``economic patriotism''; and put forward unworkable policy proposals while labelling anyone opposing those proposals as somehow being in favor of or at least indifferent to inversions. Most of the policy ideas that get put forward tend to be punitive and burdensome, with the goal, not of incentivizing companies to stay in the United States, but to forcibly prevent them from leaving. Over the past year or so of political campaigning, we have heard a lot of talk about building walls and who will be made to pay for them. Some are proposing that we build a literal physical wall to keep certain people from coming into the United States, with a supposedly clever plan to force other countries to pay for it. Well, at the same time, most of the proposals we have seen to deal with inversions would amount to building a virtual wall--a wall forged in regulation and punitive tax treatment--around the country to keep companies from leaving and making every business in America and all of their employees and individual customers pay the cost. The latest wall-building exercise came earlier this month with Treasury's temporary anti-inversion regulations and proposed regulations aimed at earnings stripping. Of course, the administration's anti-inversion approach is essentially the regulatory equivalent of a doctor who wastes all of his time and energy treating a patient's symptoms one by one as they arise without making any effort to diagnose, let alone treat, the underlying illness. Inversions are not in and of themselves a disease; they are merely symptoms of a much broader illness that will continue to infect our economy so long as we refuse to treat it. I won't keep you in suspense, Mr. President. That illness is not a lack of proper regulation; it is an overly burdensome tax system and an environment that is, on the whole, unfriendly to American businesses. U.S. companies don't move their tax headquarters offshore because they like the weather in other countries. If that were the case, I don't think so many of them would be moving to Ireland or the U.K. No. American companies invert because they face global competition, and our system forces them to compete on an uneven playing field with at least one, if not both arms tied behind their back. For example, we have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, and we have a tax code that effectively pays U.S. [[Page S2370]] multinationals to keep their foreign earnings offshore and punishes them when they decide to bring capital back into the country. It is these factors--not a lack of appropriate regulation by the government or a shortage of ``economic patriotism'' on the part of American businesses--that make foreign countries more attractive destinations for American companies. If we want to prevent future inversions, we should spend less time tinkering around the regulatory edges and engaging in partisan rhetoric and more time trying to find common ground to actually fix our Tax Code. For the record, it isn't just inversions that are the problem. As I have noted repeatedly, even if the administration and Congress found a way, through punitive and burdensome means, to block all inversions, our tax system would still make American companies even more attractive targets for foreign takeovers, which are every bit as problematic as inversions, if not more so, and much harder to address through a purely regulatory approach. Foreign takeovers are already a problem. According to an Ernst and Young study released last year, the U.S. economy suffered a net loss of $179 billion--with a ``b''--in business and assets to foreign buyers in the decade between 2003 and 2013. The same study also found that a reduced corporate tax rate would have greatly reduced these losses, possibly eliminating them entirely. Keep in mind that unlike most inversion transactions, U.S. management is almost always fired after a foreign takeover. Other employees--local service providers and suppliers--are often targeted for elimination as well. Sadly, many Democrats in Washington, both here in Congress and in the administration, don't seem to grasp the full nature of this problem. They talk a great deal about inversions and the need to prevent them. Because the picture of a big American company moving offshore to escape taxation is particularly distressing for populist audiences, they tend to ramp up that talk and couple it with ideas on how to punish inverters in even-numbered years. Yet they have taken precious little action to fix the underlying problems that lead companies to want to invert in the first place. There was a glimmer of hope with the findings and recommendations of the Finance Committee's bipartisan International Tax Reform Working Group. However, as is far too often the case, that glimmer of hope may very well be overtaken by the politics of the moment. So instead of acknowledging that our tax system is the cause of the inversion problem, my friends on the other side have generally opted to put forward regulations that may very well be effective in curbing inversions in the short term but will do nothing to improve business conditions in the United States and could be in the order of causing companies to sell themselves to foreign buyers, which is what is happening. Within days of the release of the Treasury's latest regulations, Pfizer, a major American drug company, announced it was backing out of its proposed inversion deal with Allergan. Many observers were quick to credit the Obama administration for a supposed job well done while Democratic candidates for President openly celebrated the fact that an American company chose to subject itself to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and penalties in order to avoid even greater losses as a result of these regulations. That is the kind of world we are living in--one where there is a willingness to demonize an iconic American company that employees tens of thousands of American workers and to cheer when it suffers massive losses. That is viewed as an affirmative qualification to be the Democratic nominee for President. Now, to be fair, I will acknowledge that, in addition to unveiling the proposed anti-inversion measures, the Obama administration also laid out a basic framework for corporate tax reform. Of course, this framework, which closely resembles similar proposals the President has included in past budgets, is woefully short on details. It is not a reform proposal with any serious potential for bipartisanship nor one with a detailed list of specific goals and objectives. It is more or less just a vaguely worded wish list of tax ideas they would like to see enacted at some point. The reaction from many sectors of the business community, including from CEOs who more often than not support my friends on the other side, proves the point. We know, basically, that the President's version of international tax reform consists of a one-time mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings to be taxed at a rate designed not to maximize any benefit but to hit a revenue target for increased spending--in other words, so they can spend more money. This would be coupled with a high minimum tax on foreign earnings, also designed specifically for increased spending, not for significantly bringing down the statutory tax rate, which, after all, is one of the few ways you can really help our American companies. Put simply, there is virtually nothing in the President's nebulous tax reform framework that would discourage companies from moving offshore. In fact, one could argue--and many have--that the President's proposed high minimum tax on foreign earnings would actually encourage more U.S. companies to invert. For example, this past November, the vice president of global taxes at Procter & Gamble, another iconic American company, was quoted as saying: ``If we take a step towards a [minimum] tax at the corporate level, we're exacerbating the problem; we're actually guaranteeing that inversions are more attractive.'' On top of these new taxes, there is no real effort in the President's tax framework to improve the business climate in the United States more generally. After all these changes, the framework would still leave the United States with a corporate tax that would be well above the average in the developed world, leaving us right where we have been. In short, this framework is par for the course with this administration. We have heard quite a bit of blame thrown in Congress's direction for not acting to prevent inversions. What we haven't heard is any serious effort on the part of the President or anyone in his administration to engage with Congress on meaningful tax reform. Like I said, the President and his supporters are far more willing to assign blame for the problems caused by our tax system than to actually work toward a solution. This is particularly true in election years, when the motto seems to be this: Why fix a problem when you can blame it on the other side? For my part, I am working to take specific steps to address these problems. I have been the Republican leader on the Senate Committee on Finance for about 4\1/2\ years now, and for 4\1/2\ years I have been calling on my colleagues and imploring officials in the administration to engage on tax reform. To date, I have seen little in the way of a meaningful response. Currently, I am working on a relatively simple but potentially effective tax reform proposal that I believe will be bipartisan and many believe would relieve a great deal of the inversion pressure on American companies and, at the very least, significantly alter the economic calculation for inversion transactions. Best of all, it would do so without punishing companies or imposing burdensome mandates. In short, my proposal would provide more carrots to keep companies from inverting and fewer sticks to punish companies that try to go in that direction. While I am still working with the Joint Committee on Taxation to finalize the details of this proposal, the basic idea behind my proposal would be to streamline the taxation of business income and eliminate instances in which profits and earnings are subject to multiple layers of taxation at the company and shareholder levels. I will have more to say on this proposal in the coming weeks. Today, I am simply trying to counter the narrative that American companies can and should be forced to remain in the United States by regulation. I am trying to demonstrate that you cannot fix the inversion problem by building a virtual wall around the country to keep businesses from leaving, while at the same time keeping tax rates so high that they have to leave to be able to compete. I am trying to show why you can't build that wall expecting some other [[Page S2371]] country to pay for it. Indeed, if an anti-inversion wall goes up without any real changes to improve the tax and business environment in the United States, it will be American workers and consumers that will end up footing the bill. What we are working on is corporate integration. Right now the work we have done seems to be getting some positive feedback from the Joint Taxation Committee, but they are not through with their work yet and so we are going to wait until they are. They should be through by the end of May, or at least that is what they have indicated will be their target. Hopefully, they will have some preliminary results before the end of May. But let me say, if we are right on corporate integration, then both parties should come together to resolve these problems so that we can compete with any company anywhere in the world. I can just say, in short, that this program we are devising will allow the companies themselves to bring down their own tax rates without worrying about what the wonderful Members of Congress are going to do. At the same time, by bringing down those rates, they will be able to help this economy to go forward. So far this has been revenue positive. All we want for this program is to be revenue neutral. But I think we can get there, and I hope my friends on the other side will seriously look at this because this is something we could do this year to help this country resolve its problems with regard to corporate inversions. I believe it will work. I believe it will work. But a lot will depend on the Joint Taxation Committee, and we will see what they are doing. So far the work they have done is positive. They have worked on it for a number of months now. They want to cover every possible ramification, and we are very appreciative of the work they are doing. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I filed two amendments very important to my home State of Florida that I want to discuss. The first is an amendment that would authorize the Central Everglades Planning Project. The Florida Everglades are a national treasure. We have to work together to restore these lands. The State has experienced a wetter-than-average winter. The rains have elevated the levels of Lake Okeechobee which triggered the Army Corps of Engineers to discharge billions of gallons of water to the east through the St. Lucie River and to the west through the Caloosahatchee River. These discharges have been ongoing for months and have negatively impacted the delicate ecosystem in the area as well as the agricultural and tourism industries. In order to diminish these discharges, we must authorize the Central Everglades Planning Project. Once complete, this project will allow water to flow south from Lake Okeechobee to Everglades National Park and to Florida Bay. I had hoped this project would be authorized in 2014 by the administration, but the administration delayed the Army Corps of Engineers' Chief's report, which is the final step before Congress can authorize new projects, but this year we have a real chance to get this done. Thanks to the good work of Chairman Inhofe of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I expect the Central Everglades Planning Project to be included in the forthcoming water bill, which is slated to be marked up in committee next week. I will not ask for a vote on this amendment today, but I want to draw attention to this essential Everglades restoration project. I am hopeful this body can come together to restore our Everglades, but in the meantime I will continue to push for this vital authorization. Mr. President, the other amendment I filed today, cosponsored by Senators Shelby, Nelson, and Sessions, also highlights the importance of water management. The issue at hand there involves water that is naturally supposed to flow south, but it has not done so due to the Army Corps' actions in and around the State of Georgia. The results of this mismanagement have led to a 2013 Department of Commerce fishery disaster. It was declared for oysters in the Apalachicola Bay. During that same year, Senator Nelson and I held a field hearing in Apalachicola, where we heard from local fishermen whose livelihoods and family traditions were injured by the collapse of these fisheries. While we must continue to explore ways to fish more sustainably, a large part of the fisheries' collapse was the lack of freshwater flows. I have long supported the role Governors play in water allocation when the water in question greatly impacts multiple States. However, absent such an agreement between Governors, water continues to be withheld, and the situation has now become dire in my home State of Florida. The bottom line is, the status quo is only working for one State. I, along with the senior Senator from Florida and our colleagues from Alabama, have stood lockstep to bring our respective States to the table to finalize water allocations that will take into account our shared goals. Today we filed an amendment to do just that--to require the Governors to agree on water allocation before the Army Corps of Engineers can reallocate waters between the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin. The amendment also stipulates no funds would be available for reallocation of water within the States if an agreement between the Governors is not finalized. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure. Eureka Gardens Mr. President, on a different matter, I want to take this moment to applaud the residents of Eureka Garden Apartments in Jacksonville, FL, for coming together as a community during a time of hardship. While they face dangerous living conditions and bureaucratic indifference to their concerns, they have remained united and resilient. The bottom line is, the Federal Government has failed them. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has for years certified a living facility that has put hundreds of families at risk. When HUD inspected the property in question last summer, they passed the apartment complex, and they passed it with flying colors. Eureka Gardens received an 85 out of 100, but less than a month later, residents were complaining at tenants' association meetings and to their city council members about how bad their living conditions had become. When my staff visited the complex, what they witnessed was literally unbelievable. They saw crumbling stairs and black mold. They saw exposed electrical wiring that had been covered up by a trash bag. They smelled the natural gas that would soon hospitalize residents just days later. That was and that is unacceptable. My office, along with Mayor Curry of the city of Jacksonville and the city council and the tenants association, pushed for months to have improvements and repairs done to this complex. In February, HUD finally had a date by which all repairs must be completed. When they came back to reinspect Eureka Gardens, it passed the inspection, and they eventually renewed their contract with the property's owner, but the residents continued to say what they have been saying all along--HUD's inspections weren't working. Just recently, HUD revealed that Eureka Gardens passed with a score of 62. The passing score is a 60. However, a senior HUD official admitted that HUD officials do not believe the property would currently pass another inspection. So HUD has just admitted it has certified a failing facility. Something is clearly wrong with the HUD inspection process and Floridians are being hurt because of it. I would like to read part of an article from the Florida Times-Union, which was published on Monday that quotes one of the residents at Eureka Gardens. Dwan Wilson, who said she has had to go to the hospital at least six times with asthma issues since the mold remediation, cried as she spoke about her apartments' problems. [[Page S2372]] ``We thank you all for what you're trying to do,'' Wilson said. ``We thank you all for pushing. But we're telling you they aren't doing anything.'' How many more years must the residents of Eureka Gardens suffer under this mismanagement? How many more children have to be put at risk due to lead poisoning and gas leaks? How many more facilities will HUD continue to rubberstamp approval of only to further sell slumlike conditions for the most vulnerable tenants? How many taxpayer dollars will be wasted by this agency on failing projects such as this? These are the questions HUD must answer. In the meantime, the residents of Eureka Gardens are forced to deal with the consequences of HUD's failures. I will continue to look for solutions to make sure what has happened at Eureka Gardens isn't repeated elsewhere. Americans deserve better from their government. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter I wrote to the Secretary of HUD, and it is dated April 18. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Senate, Washington, DC, April 18, 2016. Hon. Secretary Julian Castro, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, DC. Dear Secretary Castro: For over five months, my office has been involved in the investigation of shocking health and safety conditions at Eureka Garden Apartments (Eureka Garden) in Jacksonville, Florida. It is appalling that American taxpayer dollars have been wastefully spent over the years to fund a facility that has repeatedly put hundreds of people and their families at risk. I am writing to highlight these many problems and to ask for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to conduct a thorough review of its inspection process. As you may know, following reports of code violations at the Westside complex, my Jacksonville staff toured Eureka Garden in early October 2015. They witnessed crumbling stairs disguised with duct-tape and covered with apparent black mold, faulty electric wiring covered with a garbage bag, and a distinguishable natural gas odor being sucked from an outdoor piping system into residents' air-conditioning, among other obvious health and safety issues. HUD confirmed these conditions in an inspection of the property in October 2015, in which physical deficiencies were found in at least 340 of the 400 units. According to HUD's own criteria, almost 50 of those deficiencies represented ``Exigent Health and Safety concerns,'' including mold, water damage, exposed wires, carbon monoxide hazards and leaking gas pipes. Despite these findings, just three months earlier in July 2015, HUD gave Eureka Garden Apartments an 85 out of 100 score in its Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) inspection. Although many of the problems were witnessed during the summer inspection, HUD representatives defended the passing score to my staff in a meeting last October, saying they did not contribute to the assessment of the property as they are not relevant criteria under HUD's inspection process. Had it not been for the residents calling attention to their dire situation, the facility would not have been reviewed again for another two years. Your Department recently notified my office that the most recent inspection of Eureka Garden gave the complex a REAC score of 62 out 100, despite the many repairs that have been completed since the last REAC inspection. This discrepancy indicates something is clearly wrong with the REAC scores. Your Department visited Eureka Garden again on March 17th and 18th and witnessed what my staff and the city of Jacksonville has seen all along--Eureka Garden remains in poor condition. After visiting Eureka Garden most recently, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing wrote in a letter that ``HUD officials do not believe the property would currently pass another REAC inspection.'' However, HUD's protocol has placed enough confidence in the previous inspection that it has renewed GMF's $6 million contract for Eureka Garden. In doing so, HUD has knowingly certified a substandard facility because of a faulty inspection process. Your Department is ultimately responsible as the steward of the taxpayer funding that supports this property. Therefore, to address these concerns, I respectfully request a timely response to the following questions: With conditions at Eureka Garden going unidentified for so long, what does HUD plan to do about reforming its inspection process to identify problems earlier and to ensure passing grades are not given to failing properties? Will HUD explore a broader reform of inspection that expands the role of and resources available for state and local partners to regularly check the status of HUD-certified facilities to ensure greater accountability? Does the Department plan a re-inspection of the complex? During this difficult time, I am proud of the Eureka Garden community for standing up and coming together on behalf of their vulnerable neighbors. This community has demonstrated great strength by collectively voicing their concerns and showing resiliency in the face of bureaucratic indifference and property mismanagement. It is time they are given the respect and quality of life they so deserve after waiting far too long for critical improvements to be made at Eureka Garden. Thank you for your attention to this matter and continued work on this issue. I look forward to your prompt response. Sincerely, Marco Rubio, U.S. Senator. Calling for the Release of Raif Badawi and Waleed Abulkhair Mr. President, one last item I want to discuss today, and I think it is appropriate, given where the President finds himself at this moment in Saudi Arabia. It is regarding a letter I sent earlier this week, along with Senators Durbin, Risch, Leahy, and Johnson to President Obama asking him to raise human rights issues during his meetings in Saudi Arabia--in particular, the case of Raif Badawi and his lawyer Waleed Abulkhair. Raif Badawi is a Saudi blogger. He was arrested in 2012 on the charge of insulting Islam and indicted on several charges, including apostasy. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes. In January of 2015, Raif received his first set of 50 lashes in public. This resulted in an international outcry. Raif's subsequent lashes have been postponed. They have been postponed on health grounds. They have been postponed because just the first 50 lashes were so brutal, there were doubts whether he would survive 50 more, but he continues to serve his sentence in prison. Last week I met with Raif's wife to discuss his case. Raif and his lawyer should be immediately and unconditionally released. While I deeply value and think it is a very important alliance between the United States and Saudi Arabia, this alliance cannot allow our country to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses. I hope we will take up this cause. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record our letter, dated April 19, 2016, that we wrote to the President. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Senate, Washington, DC, April 19, 2016. Hon. Barack Obama, The President, The White House Washington, DC. Dear Mr. President: As you prepare for your upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia, we are writing to express concern regarding the Government of Saudi Arabia's continued treatment of human rights advocates, particularly the documented prosecutions of non-violent activists who are engaging in freedom of expression. Intolerance for freedom of speech and the imposition of travel bans and lengthy prison terms for peaceful dissidents harm Saudi Arabia's reputation internationally and stifle Saudi innovation and creativity. We are concerned that unless you make these issues a priority during your trip, human rights abuses will continue to occur with impunity and the full potential of the U.S.-Saudi relationship will continue to be impeded. Specifically, we request you raise the case of blogger Raif Badawi, who was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes for launching a website that suggested a peaceful discussion about religion. Mr. Badawi endured a first round of 50 lashes in January of 2015 but the remainder of his lashes has been postponed due to his health condition. During his unjust imprisonment, Mr. Badawi has been a recipient of prestigious international awards such as the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. We are also concerned for the case of Mr. Badawi's lawyer, prominent human rights activist Waleed Abu al-Khair, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Additionally, we are concerned about the 2014 travel ban placed on Mr. Badawi's sister Samar Badawi, for her activism defending human rights. In 2012, Ms. Badawi received the U.S. State Department's International Women of Courage Award. In recent months, Ms. Badawi has been called in for questioning by security forces on several occasions and is subject to ongoing harassment. In your meeting with King Salman, we urge you to advocate for the immediate and unconditional release of Raif Badawi and Waleed Abu al-Khair. Additionally, we urge you to request that Ms. Badawi's travel ban be lifted and ensure that she is not harassed further for her work. This is an important time for Saudi Arabia to play a leadership role in the region and the world by setting an example of religious tolerance and civility. We value the United States and Saudi Arabia close partnership and support efforts to [[Page S2373]] find common approaches to addressing such critical issues as combating terrorism. However, true partners need to be able to have a frank dialogue about disagreements and areas of concern in our relationship. It is thus essential that the United States does not turn a blind eye to Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses. Sincerely, Marco Rubio. James E. Risch. Ron Johnson. Richard J. Durbin. Patrick Leahy. Mr. RUBIO. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Energy Policy Modernization Bill Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the bipartisan Energy Policy Modernization Act, which passed the Senate yesterday with my strong support. This bill will help improve the energy efficiency of our buildings and appliances, saving Michiganders money on their heating and electric bills by incentivizing weatherization and other activities. Many of these cutting-edge building efficiency technologies, such as insulation and window sealing, are designed and developed in my great State of Michigan. The bill also included a number of conservation provisions that will not only protect our environment, but they will boost our economy by supporting the $646 billion outdoor recreation industry. Permanent authorizations of the Land and Water Conservation Fund and reauthorization of the North American Wetland Conservation Act are just two examples that will protect wildlife habitat and improve access to public lands for all kinds of outdoor recreation. Mr. President, I would also like to take a moment to focus on a bipartisan provision that I authored with my colleagues Senator Stabenow and Senator Alexander, the Vehicle Innovation Act. This legislation will provide the tools that researchers, engineers, manufacturers, and others need to create the next generation of cars and trucks built in Michigan and in States all across our country. Southeast Michigan is home to more engineers per capita than anywhere else in the country. We must ensure that our automakers, part suppliers, and other advanced manufacturers have the right tools to develop and incorporate new vehicle innovations that will improve safety, innovation, and vehicle performance in the cars and trucks of the future. Exciting innovations are already underway. Cars and trucks are being made with high-strength, light-weight materials that can improve fuel economy without compromising safety. Improved combustion technologies can increase the efficiency of traditional engines while decreasing emissions. Researchers are making batteries more affordable and recyclable while enhancing battery range and performance, making hybrids and electric vehicles even more competitive. The Department of Energy's Vehicle Technologies Program is leading this effort, working with a wide range of partners, manufacturers, material suppliers, universities, energy suppliers, and our National Laboratories. The Department of Energy's vehicle technology activities are authorized by a patchwork of different laws, and these authorities were last renewed almost a decade ago. A lot has changed in that time. Vehicles today are wired with cutting-edge electronics and sensors. While my favorite part of Detroit cars and trucks remains horsepower and torque, advances in onboard computers and new technologies are making our cars safer, more efficient, and more competitive globally. The Peters-Alexander-Stabenow Vehicle Innovation Act provides for a steady increase in funding for critical DOE programs through the year 2020. This will create more certainty for companies and entrepreneurs engaged in public-private partnerships and ensure that critical research and development can keep up as technologies continue to emerge. Our bill also establishes a clean authorization for DOE's advanced vehicle technology activities. This will improve collaboration with light-duty automobile and medium- and heavy-duty commercial truck engineers, manufacturers, and suppliers to conduct cutting-edge technology-neutral research that will improve fuel economy and minimize fossil fuel use. With over 256 million vehicles on our roads, it takes decades of sustained effort to turn over our fleet. It is absolutely critical that we continue developing these advanced technologies here in the United States in order to achieve major fuel savings in the future and become truly energy independent. The Vehicle Innovation Act has support from major manufacturers, labor, and environmental groups. This is something that just makes sense. I appreciate the support of Senators Murkowski and Cantwell and all my colleagues who supported including this legislation in the bipartisan energy package. While I was pleased to see this commonsense measure included, I continue to be frustrated and disappointed that this body has held up an up-or-down vote on a bipartisan package authored by Senator Stabenow and me to help the people of Flint, MI. Flint is still in crisis mode as families still do not have safe, reliable water flowing from their taps. Senator Stabenow and I will continue pursuing all paths to fight for the assistance that the people of Flint deserve. We will not give up. We remain fully committed to delivering to Flint families the assistance they need to be able to use their tap water for bathing, cooking, and drinking without the fear that it may harm them or their children. I know that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are willing and able to join us in our efforts to help Flint. I urge them to continue working with us to pass this package through the Senate as soon as possible. The people of Flint cannot wait any longer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Judiciary Committee Investigations Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to take this time to respond to Senator Reid's juvenile attacks on my Judiciary Committee's investigations and to Senator Reid's frequent crying about my previous State Department holds. Over the past several months, Senator Reid has been obsessed with mentioning holds on nominees--holds which I no longer have. Holds are often necessary to force the executive branch to comply with congressional investigations. If you want proof of that, just ask the Obama administration. In a Federal court filing during the Fast and Furious litigation, the Obama administration argued that the court should not even consider that particular case. The Justice Department's brief said courts should not enforce subpoenas at all. Instead, the Justice Department reasoned that Congress should use other powers to get documents. Here is exactly what the government brief said: ``Among other powers, Congress can withhold funds from the Executive Branch, override vetoes, decline to enact legislation, refuse to act on nominations, and adjourn.'' Later in the brief, the Obama administration specifically suggested that Congress can ``tie up nominations'' in order to get documents. If the administration can say that, why would Senator Reid think that is a wrong act for Congress to take? It is this simple: If the minority leader doesn't like Senators using holds to get documents from agencies, perhaps Senator Reid should talk to his friends in the Obama administration who suggested that in the first place. In addition, Senator Reid shows his hypocrisy since Members on his own side have held up Obama nominees, and Senator Reid never said a peep about Democrats exercising their rights. Further, Senator Reid's attempts to politicize the Judiciary Committee's oversight work are very uninformed and result in misguided statements, and Senator Reid's accusation that taxpayer money is being wasted by engaging in oversight of the executive branch rings hollow. Secretary Clinton's nongovernment server and private email arrangements effectively walled off her official communications from the normal Freedom [[Page S2374]] of Information Act and other Federal recordkeeping requirements. So to Senator Reid, I say: The Freedom of Information Act is squarely within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee and subject to oversight. The former Secretary's use of a secret, private server to conduct all of her official business led to an avalanche of Freedom of Information Act litigation. It also caused inaccurate responses to Freedom of Information Act requests. For example, in December 2012, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for records of Secretary Clinton's email addresses. The Department responded by stating: ``No records responsive to your request were located.'' That response is very misleading, at best. Senior Department officials knew about Secretary Clinton's use of private email for official correspondence since they were sending emails to her nongovernment email address. They would have known instantly of records responsive to that request that the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington submitted. Yet those senior officials apparently failed to communicate with the State Department's Freedom of Information Act office. Even then, if State's FOIA office were to search Secretary Clinton's government email account, they would find nothing since she operated a private account not subject to freedom of information. Separate from her email address, Secretary Clinton's nongovernment server was a secret to high-level officials at the State Department who were responsible for information technology and security. These officials had no idea the Secretary was operating a separate unofficial system. She did not get their approval to do so, so how would they know? The Judiciary Committee has interviewed the Chief Information Officer, the former Chief Information Officer, the former Deputy Chief Information Officer, and the Director of Diplomatic Security at the State Department. The Chief Information Officers oversaw the work of the information technology staffer who Secretary Clinton secretly paid to maintain her nonpublic server, yet all of these people knew nothing about that nonpublic server. That staffer didn't ask permission to have outside employment. While working at the State Department, he didn't disclose his outside income on his financial disclosure forms. Now, think about that. Officials whose job it is to know were kept in the dark about this ``home brew'' email server. If a government agency hopes to be transparent with the American people--and that is the point behind the Freedom of Information Act legislation--it must first be transparent with itself. Now we know that highly classified material was transmitted to and stored on Secretary Clinton's secret server. What is important about that is this is an issue of national security. State Department diplomatic security personnel have informed the Judiciary Committee that they were unaware of Secretary Clinton's using a nongovernment server for official business. So how, then, could they possibly secure it from security threats? Now, the FBI is investigating this matter as well as several other investigations. We keep hearing that the FBI's inquiry is just a security review and not a criminal inquiry. So let me tackle that. However, one witness asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination rather than answer questions about his work on Secretary Clinton's secret server. And he is relying on the Fifth Amendment to withhold his personal emails as well. Recently, the Department of Justice granted him immunity. So, quite naturally, we are searching for other ways to get information before deciding whether it might be appropriate to seek an immunity order for his testimony. Now, to Senator Reid: These are legitimate oversight inquiries for the Judiciary Committee. Further, Secretary Clinton did not turn over all of her official emails. Emails between GEN David Petraeus and Secretary Clinton, which Secretary Clinton failed to provide to the State Department, were later turned over to the Defense Department. Secretary Clinton also failed to turn over emails with Sydney Blumenthal, whom Secretary Clinton views as an off-the-books intelligence resource, while Secretary of State. If Secretary Clinton had used a government email address for official emails, we wouldn't have this problem in the first place. So how many more official emails were not turned over but should have been? The Judiciary Committee cannot ignore these important issues simply because the former Secretary decided to run for President. And to be perfectly clear, I started this investigation before Secretary Clinton announced her candidacy. Senator Reid suggested that the committee's work on these issues is a waste of money. Senator Reid, that is nonsense. Congressional oversight is not a waste of money; it is a constitutional responsibility. The minority leader fails to understand that Congress is obligated to oversee that the executive branch of government faithfully executes the laws and faithfully spends the money the way Congress intended. Without such constitutional oversight, Congress will not know if there are failures in the executive branch's duty to faithfully execute the laws that we pass. But do my colleagues know what is a real waste of money? This administration fought tooth and nail in the courts against Congress for more than 4 years. Why? Just to avoid disclosing documents in the Fast and Furious scandal that they eventually turned over. That is a waste of money--a 4-year waste of money. The Obama administration has fought against the press and watchdog organizations for years in the Freedom of Information Act litigation over former Secretary Clinton's email records. Senator Reid, that is a waste of money. It is shocking that the Obama Justice Department devotes so much taxpayer resources to avoiding the very transparency that President Obama promised on January 21, 2009--1 day into office. This administration was going to be the most transparent in the history of the entire country, and it has turned out to be the most stonewalling. None of that would be necessary if the administration would just comply with congressional subpoenas and the Freedom of Information Act. That is the way to save money. By the way, I would like to ask how much taxpayers' money does Senator Reid spend having his staff write daily speeches trying to undermine the work of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Reid also fails to understand that we are not only focused on Secretary Clinton. The committee is conducting dozens of investigations on a broad range of issues under the jurisdiction of the committee. Some of the executive branch agencies have complained about the amount of oversight work the committee does on other matters. To justify my statements for this part of my remarks, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two letters. The first is from the Department of Homeland Security, and the second is from the Department of Justice. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC, November 18, 2015. Hon. Charles E. Grassley, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Grassley: Since I became Secretary of Homeland Secretary almost two years ago, I have worked to make the Department more responsive to congressional correspondence, directives, request for reports, briefings and hearings, and other requests for documents and information. Given that some 108 committees and subcommittees of Congress (depending on how you count) assert oversight jurisdiction over this Department, this is a full-time, time consuming task. We have also participated in about 100 hearings and over 2000 non-hearing engagements with Congressional members and staff since the beginning of the 114th Congress. Members on both sides of the aisle have acknowledged our increased responsiveness. So far in 2015, I have received 46 letters from you alone-- almost one per week. I know because I read them all. Many of these letters request reams of information, data, and documents that take hundreds of hours and dozens of staff to compile. We work diligently to respond to your letters promptly, but there is a huge cost to this. [[Page S2375]] Senator, I ask for your help in focusing and prioritizing these oversight letters. I want to continue to be responsive to your requests, and I want to do so as quickly as possible. At the same time, I must ensure that my staff remains focused on all our other priorities. I welcome the opportunity to discuss with you. Sincerely, Jeh Charles Johnson. ____ U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legislative Affairs, Washington, DC, September 18, 2015. Hon. Charles E. Grassley, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: This responds to your letters to the Attorney General, dated June 12, 2015, July 10, 2015, August 13, 2015, September 14, 2015, and September 15, 2015, regarding the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The Department of Justice (the Department) has provided responses in our letters of August 14, 2015, August 25, 2015, and September 11, 2015. As noted in those letters and discussed with your staff, we continue to collect and review information, including the information noted in your letters, so we may provide a complete and thorough response to all of your inquiries as expeditiously as possible. We will continue to keep an open line of communication with your staff as we work toward additional responses to your questions. The Department takes these issues seriously, and we thank you for bringing them to our attention. As you know, this year the Department has received from your office almost 100 letters containing more than 825 questions and document requests, including the five letters received to date on this matter. While we have made and will continue to make all reasonable efforts to meet your stated deadlines, our ability to respond in a timely manner to your inquiries is impacted by the significant volume of letters we receive. We hope this information is helpful. Please do not hesitate to contact this office if we may provide additional assistance regarding this or any other matter. Sincerely, Peter J. Kadzik, Assistant Attorney General. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, both of the letters note the many dozen letters and hundreds of requests that I have sent, and both essentially complain about the volume of our investigation and requests for information. The Judiciary Committee is hard at work doing the people's business, and the committee is doing much more than just oversight. The committee has reported 16 executive nominees and 37 judicial nominees. It has processed 27 bipartisan bills out of committee, and every bill that has come out of committee is a bipartisan bill. Eighteen of those bills were passed out of the Senate over to the House, eight of which have been signed into law by the President. Just last week, the committee unanimously adopted bipartisan legislation to finally protect FBI whistleblowers who report wrongdoing to their supervisors and provide for independent review of FBI whistleblower cases for the first time. So reviewing that record, it seems to me we can ask Senator Reid to justify his claim that this committee is partisan. The committee concluded an investigation into the abuse and misuse of paid administrative leave. The committee took the results and worked hard with Members on both sides of the aisle to actually fix that problem. In February, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee approved the bipartisan, commonsense reforms in the Administrative Leave Act of 2016. Similarly, the committee has worked with Democrats and Republicans alike to overturn an Office of Legal Counsel opinion that allows the agencies across government to stonewall their inspectors general. Now let me tell my colleagues how Senator Reid is involved in stonewalling that effort. We came up with a legislative solution called the IG Empowerment Act and attempted to pass it in December by a live unanimous consent request. But Senator Reid objected to the bill even though it is supported by seven Members of his own caucus and supported by the New York Times editorial board and a host of civil liberties and good-government groups. Even the largest circulating daily newspaper in the home State of Senator Reid urged him to work with us on a compromise. But rather than engaging us in a productive and civil manner, Senator Reid publicly slandered the bill as a legislative overreach. He claimed that he was concerned about a provision that allowed inspectors general to issue testimonial subpoenas to fight waste, fraud, and abuse. In fact, Senator Reid voted--Senator Reid actually voted--to give the exact same authority to the Office of Special Counsel in 1989. That 1989 bill passed the Senate unanimously and is now law. Senator Reid, was that legislative overreach when you did it? Like that bill, the IG Empowerment Act has near unanimous support and is designed to root out wrongdoing from government, while ensuring proper safeguards of the use of subpoenas. So there is no reason to object to this bill on policy grounds. Yet Senator Reid stands in the way of getting that done. The Judiciary Committee will continue its work. I say that to just one Senator: Senator Reid. And during the course of my oversight work, I will use every tool at my disposal to obtain answers for the American people. So, Senator Reid, I will keep faith with my oath of office and ``we the people.'' I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Oklahoma City Bombing Anniversary and Nomination of Merrick Garland Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, 21 years ago this week, the families of 168 people--19 of those 168 people children--received some of the worst news of their lives. That news was that a beloved member of each of their families had been killed in the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City. We all watched the news that day, that night, the next day, and that week and beyond, as we took in the devastation caused by that blast. That horrible crime was carried out by a radical, anti-government extremist. It remains the deadliest act of homegrown terrorism in our Nation's history. For the families who lost a loved one that day in 1995, there is no way to fill the void left by a life taken too soon, but I know that our government's pursuit of justice for the lives lost that day serve as a small source of comfort for the people who were left in mourning. At the time of that heinous crime, Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, was the Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice. He immediately flew to Oklahoma City to lead the criminal investigation and supervise the prosecution of the bombers. In fact, he insisted on being sent. He didn't just volunteer. He didn't just say: Well, OK, I will go. He told his supervisors they had to let him go. He was the highest ranking Justice Department official on the ground in Oklahoma City following the bombing. He helped oversee every aspect of the investigation and the subsequent trial. His colleagues at the time have attested to Judge Garland's commitment to following the letter of the law in every aspect of that investigation. He refused to take any shortcuts that could somehow compromise the integrity of the case that he and his team were building. Through their tireless efforts, his tireless leadership, his deep understanding of the law, and scrupulous attention to detail, Judge Garland ensured the prosecution had an airtight case. Ultimately, both bombers were convicted, giving the families of the 168 victims not their sons, their daughters, their children, their moms or dads back again, but at least providing a small measure of vindication for the losses they had incurred. Judge Garland's work was so appreciated by the families and friends of those victims 21 years ago that last year, on the 20th anniversary of the bombing, the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum awarded Judge Garland its annual Reflections of Hope distinction--not the year after the bombing but 20 years after the bombing. Judge Garland has established an unparalleled reputation as a brilliant, dedicated prosecutor and jurist. He has received strong bipartisan support in the legal community, including from Alberto Gonzales, the former U.S. Attorney General and White House Counsel in the administration of President George W. Bush. So today it is not just discouraging that most of my Republican colleagues are refusing to consider Judge Garland's nomination to serve on our highest Court; personally, I believe it is outrageous. [[Page S2376]] I served for 8 years as Governor of Delaware, a State that is renowned for its own courts--supreme court, court of chancery, superior court--courts that play a national role, not just on a State level. As Governor of my State for 8 years, I nominated men and women to serve on those courts. In every one of those nominations there were hearings held, whether they were Democrat or Republican. I think during that period of time I nominated an equal number of Democrats and Republicans to the judiciary. That is the constitution of our State, and, frankly, that is a great example because in Delaware we have one of the highest regarded judiciaries. My obligation as Governor was to nominate outstanding candidates for these judgeships as they became vacant. The role of the State Senate in Delaware was to consider them. They never waited a year and left a seat vacant for a year awaiting the end of my time as Governor or any other Governor's time. That would never happen. We wouldn't waste 10 months. State senators in our State wouldn't wait 10 weeks. They did their jobs. They did their jobs. We are not doing ours, and we need to. The fact that we haven't is outrageous. When we elect Presidents to this country, we elect them for 4 years, and if they are reelected, then it is for another 4 years. They are not Presidents for 3 years and 11 months; they are not elected to a term of 3 years and 10 months. We elect them to a term of 4 years. They need to be on the job for 4 years. Our President is doing what he is supposed to do, and that is sending us the names of exceptional people who serve in incredibly important positions like the Supreme Court. He has done his job. I very much want to do mine, and I want to be joined by Democrats and Republicans in doing our jobs. Every Member of this body has taken at least one oath to uphold the Constitution--some of us, many times over. At 17 years old, not much older than the young interns who are sitting here in the Chamber, I took my first oath as a midshipman. I was a freshman at the Ohio State Navy ROTC, where I was privileged to go on a Navy scholarship. Four years later, I took another oath and raised my right hand as an ensign in the Navy. I took an oath to defend the Constitution and the country and headed to Pensacola, FL, to become a naval flight officer right in the middle of the Vietnam war. I ended up serving three tours over there during that conflict. As a Congressman, I took an oath to defend the country and Constitution. As Governor, I also took a similar oath to defend our country's Constitution--at least to defend our State's constitution. Then, as a U.S. Senator I have taken an oath any number of times. I am regarded by my colleagues as one of the least partisan people here, but I think the refusal of the majority to even consider this nomination is more than an abdication of our responsibility. I believe it is an example of playing politics with the very Constitution we have sworn to uphold. For those who don't know, Delaware is known as the First State. We are known as the First State because on December 7, 1787, before any other State had ratified the Constitution, we did. I joke with people that for 1 week Delaware was the entire United States of America. We opened things up and let in Maryland; we let in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and eventually Louisiana--even Iowa. I think for the most part it has turned out pretty well, but the idea of playing politics with the Constitution that we have sworn to uphold is deeply troubling to me. I hope that is not what is going on here, but I fear that it is. The right and just way to proceed is to begin consideration of Judge Garland's nomination, not next month and not some other year, but now-- first in committee and then on the Senate floor. We have something we call the Delaware way. We are focused on the three C's--communicate, compromise, and collaborate. That is a good example for 49 other States, and I think it is a good example right here. After all, we have been sent by the people to this hallowed place, this Senate Chamber, to put democracy into action, to protect liberty and to protect justice for all. Nearly 50 years ago, former Chief Justice Warren Burger, a conservative--I believe he was from California and was appointed or nominated by Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican. Former Chief Justice Warren Burger said, ``A sense of confidence in the courts is essential to maintain the fabric of ordered liberty for a free people.'' He went on to say that ``inefficiency and delay will drain even a just judgment of its value.'' I think the shorthand version of that is justice delayed is justice denied. Justice delayed is justice denied. By dragging our feet and trying to get into a new Congress, maybe with a new President--certainly, with a new President--that is delaying justice, I believe. In the face of the prospect of any number of potentially 4-to-4 divided verdicts in the Supreme Court with only eight members, we cannot just stand aside and let that happen. Justice Burger was right when he said those words all those years ago, and he is right today. Mr. President, I think it is time to stop this delay. It is time for us to serve the people. It is time for us to deliver justice. It is time for us to give this President's nominee the consideration demanded of us by the Constitution, which we are sworn to uphold. Mr. President, I see no colleague seeking recognition, and with that I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Prince Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to speak of the loss of the one of Minnesota's own, and that is Prince. Like all Minnesotans, today we were shocked and saddened. I grew up with Prince's music, starting with ``Little Red Corvette'' in the seventies and eighties. We won't forget ``Purple Rain'' in Minnesota. We were so proud of that movie, and everyone would point at every spot in the movie they knew from growing up. He was a superstar, composer, amazing performer, and a music innovator with a fierce belief in the independence of his art. He lived his art. He believed his words were his own, his name was his own, and he wasn't going to let anyone own him. There was absolutely nobody like him, and there never will be. Prince sold more than 100 million records worldwide. He released 39 studio albums. He had five No. 1 Billboard hits and 40 in the top 100. He won seven Grammys, an Oscar, and a Golden Globe. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the first year he was eligible. But even with all that success, even with all that fame, Minnesota never lost that sense that he was a beloved son--our neighbor, the superstar next door. I was always so proud to say: ``Prince--you know he's from Minnesota.'' He was born there, and he still lives there. The fact that Prince was a proud native of my State came through in all of his music. He pioneered the Minneapolis sound--that mixture of funk, rock, and pop that emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s and influenced music for decades to come. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Janet Jackson, Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson, Justin Timberlake, The Weeknd, Beyonce--these are just some of the many artists who were influenced by that sound. But that sound didn't just influence artists, it influenced everyone who heard it. Prince's music touched our hearts, opened our minds, and made us want to dance. That is his legacy, and that is what we will always remember. Prince made ``Purple Rain'' a household name. Like most Minnesotans, I remember the first time I listened to that album. It was, as his band was then called, a revolution. It changed music forever and is considered among the best in music history. Two of the songs on that album--``When Doves Cry,'' which is especially notable because he plays all of the instruments in the song, and ``Let's Go Crazy''--rose to the top of the charts. [[Page S2377]] ``Let's Go Crazy'' includes a lesson important to remember on days like today. There is a world waiting for us after this life, Prince sang, ``a world of never ending happiness, where you can always see the sun, day or night.'' I know that today all of us hope Prince is standing in that Sun. Prince sang that song at First Avenue--the venue in downtown Minneapolis--when he introduced his band to the city in 1983. There, too, Prince shot some of the scenes for his classic ``Purple Rain'' film. Today the club is a landmark and a must-play venue for some of the best artists. I personally stood in Prince's dressing room surrounded by pictures of him. The building is covered in stars with the names of artists who have performed there, and there will always be one star that will shine the brightest, and that is the man who made it the landmark it is--Prince. Minnesota loves Prince, and Prince loved Minnesota. He was born in Minneapolis. He went to Central High School, where he played piano and guitar for a band called Grand Central. He recorded his early demo tapes with Chris Moon and at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis. Throughout his life, he called Minnesota home. He wrote a song about the Minnesota Vikings--he was always a big fan--appropriately titled ``Purple and Gold.'' At the end of last year when the Minnesota Lynx--our women's basketball team--won the WNBA championship, he held a concert at his recording studio, Paisley Park, for local fans, who got to enjoy his music well into the night. Just a few days ago, he hosted a dance party there and made a brief appearance. In some way, it was his last gift to our State. But his best and lasting gift? His music, his innovation, his energy. When accepting BET's Lifetime Achievement Award, Prince said: The future's in your hands now. And the world really is yours. Well, that world is a whole lot cooler because Prince was in it, and it is a whole lot sadder today now that he is gone. My heart goes out to his friends and family and to all who mourn his loss today. We will miss the artist Prince. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Paris Climate Agreement Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am on the floor I guess just a few moments ahead of the ranking member of our Senate Foreign Relations Committee, my friend Ben Cardin, who is on his way but has authorized me to proceed with a few remarks on the topic that he and I, and perhaps others, would like to address, which is tomorrow's signing in New York of the Paris climate agreement. Over 160 nations around the world are going to be participating in signing that agreement that will move many of them immediately into their program of compliance and signify for others a statement of intention to join. I think it is the largest international agreement, in terms of the number of countries involved, ever, certainly the biggest one I can think of. So it is very significant in that respect. One other thing about Paris that I think was also very significant is what took place in America's corporate sector in support of a strong Paris Agreement. The President and groups like Ceres, with particular leadership from companies like Unilever, got together and created a remarkable American corporate coalition with more than 150 companies, including ones like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, Ford and GM, Nike, and VF industries, General Mills, Cargill, Apple, Google--a terrific coalition; kind of the who's who of corporate America. They got together to urge the countries of the world to be bold in Paris, to have it be a strong agreement, and to show their support for an international program to address climate change, which I think is terrific. The distinguished junior Senator from Louisiana is presiding, and I can't think off the top of my head what Louisiana-based companies are part of that coalition, but certainly companies that are based in virtually every State we represent in the Senate--major companies: Walmart, for instance, out of Arkansas; Coca-Cola, out of Georgia; VF industries, out of North Carolina; some of our biggest electric utilities; the bulk of the property casualty insurance and reinsurance industry. It is very significant that America's corporate community came so strongly together. I hope very much that is a message that not only resonated in Paris but that will resonate in Congress as well because I would bet that every single one of us have a significant home State corporation that has signed that pledge, and some of us will have many significant home State corporations that will have signed that pledge. So when you have gotten to the point where the leadership of America's corporate community has signed on to the fact that something needs to be done and that America ought to lead--that is our role in the world--that will begin more and more to have an effect in this body to counter some of the nonsense and mischief that a very small slice in the fossil fuel industry has been propagating at the expense of the broader American corporate community, which, by and large, has been pretty outstanding on this. Let me also mention one other thing that has happened just this afternoon, which I am very encouraged by; that is, an amendment that has been filed by 10 Senators--bipartisan, 5 and 5. It is the Graham- Whitehouse amendment. The cosponsors on the Republican side are Senators Graham, Kirk, Ayotte, Collins, and Portman. On the Democratic side, they are Whitehouse, Merkley, Schatz, Markey, and Brown. The amendment reads: Climate change is real, and human activity contributes to climate change. Climate change is already affecting the American people and poses an increasing risk to our health, security, economy, and infrastructure. Over 180 nations, including China, India, and Brazil, have made commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, creating opportunities for American workers and innovative private industry benefits from global clean energy markets. Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that the United States should be a world leader in addressing climate change; that Congress is best positioned to address policies that leave a prosperous economy and healthy environment for future generations; that Congress has a responsibility to take actions that reduce emissions and combat climate change; and, finally, that Congress should support research and development to bolster clean energy technology. In that latter regard, let me note the Mission Innovation Initiative that has come out of Secretary Moniz's Department of Energy and out of a significant group of major investors around the world. The deal basically is that countries involved will try to double our clean energy R&D, and in return these major investors from around the world, led by Bill Gates, will set up a significant fund that will take the emerging technologies that early R&D can discover and bring them through the various early investment stages of what investors and startup folks call the valleys of death on the way to becoming a sustainable company so those technologies can be brought forward on an accelerated basis. So when you look at Paris, you not only see this enormous array of nations coming together in a common cause, you see right behind it virtually the entirety of the leadership of America's corporate sector coming right in with it and saying: This is what we want. This is what we encourage. We want it to be strong. You have the biggest investors in the world, most of them coming together and saying: We are going to have your back with investment into new types of clean energy funding. And then you have the governments of the world not only signing up for--not all of them but the ones participating in Mission Innovation-- signing up, in addition to the treaty, for this commitment to increase R&D and press innovation in this space forward. So for all those reasons and more, tomorrow is a good news day for our country. It is a good news day for [[Page S2378]] progress and innovation, it is a good news day for the enormous array of American corporate leaders who have supported and cheered on this particular occasion, and I think it is an occasion for pride on the part of the United States of America that the signing will be taking place in the United States in New York, that Secretary Kerry will be attending, that the Chinese leader will be attending, and that people from all around the world will be there not only recognizing the need to do this but recognizing America's leadership in getting us to this place. I will close with a personal note of appreciation for a gentleman named Todd Stern. Todd was the climate negotiator for the Department of State for many years, and some of those were rather bleak years in which the United States was not showing leadership. So Todd had to hang in there and endure that frustration and keep his candle of faith burning until the day came when we finally began to kick in at last. His role was very important in getting us prepared for and through the Paris Agreement. He is retiring and has served his country well. So I will close with a word of good will for that particular public servant who has done right by his duty and done right by his country. With that, I yield the floor, and with any luck, we can await the arrival of Senator Cardin in due course. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Prince Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks today regarding climate change, I wish to say a few words about a Minnesota icon who passed away today. Prince was a phenomenal artist who was beloved by people all over the world, but as Minnesotans, we are particularly proud to call him one of our own. Prince got his start in a Minneapolis jazz band and went on to share his talent throughout Minnesota and all over the globe. His artistry, his innovation, and his unparalleled presence inspired and will continue to inspire millions of people. In Minneapolis, he put one of our most cherished venues, First Avenue, on the map. Up until just a few days ago, he was still performing, having held a concert in Atlanta. He is truly going to be missed. Someone once said: A brain isn't a mind, and a mind isn't a soul, and that is why we need the artists. I think the outpouring of appreciation we are seeing today for Prince has to do with that unique role artists play, and it speaks to the importance of the arts and to human beings. Paris Climate Agreement Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in celebrating the official signing of the Paris climate agreement. Tomorrow, more than 160 countries will send representatives to New York to sign onto this historic agreement. This gathering is set to become the most well-attended signing event in the history of the United Nations--highlighting the importance of this issue for people around the entire world. I think it is very fitting that this event is taking place on Earth Day. This agreement has been nearly 25 years in the making. International climate efforts date back to 1992, when governments met in Rio with the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations. Nations have met every year since then to further this goal. While some meetings have been more successful than others, most have been met with disappointment and lack of action. After all, climate change is a complex issue, and achieving consensus for any international issue is no small fete, which is why this agreement is truly, truly impressive. Last December, I traveled to Paris with nine of my colleagues. We met with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, with U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, and with our then top climate change negotiator Todd Stern. I would like to congratulate all of them for their stellar work. I would also like to thank Todd Stern for his service at the State Department and his dedication to combating climate change. Mr. Stern played a critical role in achieving a successful resolution in Paris, and I have no doubt that his successor, Dr. Jonathan Pershing, will effectively continue his work. Climate change is an existential threat to our planet and to future generations. My colleagues have been on the floor of the Senate today to talk about the impacts of climate change on their States and the need to address it. So I wish to take a minute to talk about how it is going to impact Minnesota. Minnesota is one of the top producing agricultural States in the country, where one out of five jobs is tied to agriculture. Climate change will have significant impact on our food system, both through warmer temperatures and more intense droughts. A recent study estimates that global crop production could decrease by more than 40 percent by the end of the century. That is why I joined Dave MacLennan, the CEO of Cargill--the largest privately owned company in the country--in penning an op-ed in the Minneapolis StarTribune to highlight this threat, especially considering that the global population will reach 9 billion by midcentury. As the CEO of a company focused on agriculture, David is concerned about what climate change is going to do to our food supply. Climate change will also impact our waters. Minnesota is the Land of 10,000 Lakes. Actually, it is about 14,000 lakes, including Lake Superior, which contains about 10 percent of the world's fresh surface water. Lake Superior has about 10 percent of the fresh surface water on Earth. Lake Superior is warming by 2 degrees per decade. We are seeing more evaporation and lower water levels in the lake. Plus, rising temperatures allow for more favorable conditions for invasive species and hazardous algal blooms. Warmer temperatures could also have severe consequences to fish like walleye and trout, which are so important to Minnesota fisheries and to our ecosystems. Let's not forget the threat of climate change to our forests. Like our lakes, warmer temperatures elevate the threat of invasive species-- invasive species such as the emerald ash borer and gypsy moth, which are rapidly changing the composition of our forests. In other parts of the country, we are seeing longer wildfire seasons--wildfires that are burning hotter, more intense, and bigger. The Forest Service is spending more and more fighting these fires--now more than half of its entire budget. So we can see that climate change poses a very serious threat to Minnesota, our country, and the world. The Paris Agreement that we will sign tomorrow marks an important step forward to address this threat. But, of course, our job is not done. We have to remain vigilant and build upon the success of the agreement. Internationally, we have to hold other nations accountable, ensure that they commit to stronger emission reduction targets over time, and make sure that those reductions are transparent and verifiable. Domestically, we have to build on the success of our cities and States--like Minnesota--that have been working hard for a long time now to become more energy efficient and reduce emissions. I have two grandchildren, and I am expecting a third later this year. God willing, they will live through this century and into the next. I want them to know that when we had the opportunity to put the Earth on a safer path, we seized the moment. Let's recognize the historic nature of this year's Earth Day, and let's celebrate this climate agreement because it is an important milestone. Let's build on it to make the planet a safer and more habitable place for our grandchildren, their children, and their grandchildren. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from Minnesota, Senator Franken, for his comments concerning an important day tomorrow. It is important for many reasons. We have worked a long time to get the global community engaged on climate change. As Senator Franken pointed out, tomorrow is Earth Day. It will be the [[Page S2379]] 46th anniversary of Earth Day, which was started by our former colleague Senator Gaylord Nelson. He did that because he recognized it is important for this country to recognize our global responsibilities to our environment and to our future. There is no greater challenge that we face than climate change because climate change has been caused, in part, by our own activities here on Earth, by the emission of greenhouse gases. We have a responsibility to reverse the current trends. We can do that. Tomorrow in New York City, many leaders will come to sign the COP21 agreement that was negotiated in Paris earlier this year by 16 nations representing 98 percent of the global greenhouse emissions. This is a historic moment. I want to reflect for a moment about the U.S. leadership that has brought us to this moment in which we now have an agreement among so many countries of the world. We have been trying to do this now for a long time. We have not been successful. At last, the global community has come together with meaningful commitments that will put us on the right path, and the U.S. leadership made this possible. I want to congratulate President Obama for his leadership on this. I was with Secretary Moniz in Paris. Ten members of the U.S. Senate went to Paris during the COP21 negotiations. We were there less than 48 hours, but I think we were able to broadcast the united support for U.S. leadership for a global commitment. Secretary of Energy Moniz took us to the exhibit where we saw firsthand U.S. technology that will help us meet the challenges of climate change--how we can produce energy more efficiently and how we can use energy more efficiently. It was U.S. technology, and that technology will be used around the world. I mention that because U.S. global leadership is critically important to help save our planet from the adverse impacts of climate change, yes, but it also will help our economy. It will help our economy, obviously, in dealing with the effects of climate change but also in U.S. technology being used around the world, creating jobs here in the United States. This is an urgent issue. If I might, let me first quote from Pope Francis. He said: The urgent challenge to protect our common home includes a concern to bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change. . . . I urgently appeal, for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all. . . . Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political, and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. I couldn't agree with him more. This is a global challenge with global, grave consequences if we don't get it right. I see that in my own State of Maryland's Smith Island, which is disappearing into the Chesapeake Bay. I see it in the Chesapeake Bay with the loss of sea grasses because of warmer water temperatures. Sea grasses are critically important to the survival of the Maryland blue crab. I see it in our coastal safety, as we see more and more storms with more consequences. Recently I traveled to the southern part of Africa, and I had a chance to see from a helicopter the impact of climate change. In the southern part of Africa, they have only two seasons: the rainy season and the dry season. They are now at about one season: the dry season. We were there during the rainy season, and by helicopter we flew over land that should have been part of a pond. Instead, it was dry, no water. We saw the carcasses of animals that couldn't survive because of the drought. Climate change is real and is affecting our planet. There are vulnerable nations--from the Marshall Islands to Bangladesh and so many others--whose very existence is at risk because of climate change. This is an urgent issue that requires an urgent response. But here we can make a difference. We can make a difference through conserving and using less energy and producing our energy in a more environmentally friendly way in a carbon-free environment. I am joined by Congressman Delaney and many Members of both the House and Senate in saying that the United States should make a commitment to produce at least 50 percent of our electricity through a carbon-free source by the year 2030. We can do that. Here is the good news. It will not only be good for our environment, it will be good for our economy and good for our national security. Renewable energy sources can be produced here in America. You don't have to depend on the fossil fuels from countries who disagree with our way of life. For the sake of our national security, for the sake of our national economy, there are more jobs in clean energy than there are in fossil fuel industry. For all those reasons--for our economy, for our security, and for our environment--U.S. leadership in dealing with these solutions can help America's security. Yes, U.S. leadership is absolutely vital. We saw that in COP21. Without U.S. leadership, it could not be done. Here is where I really call upon our colleagues. I have said this many times on the floor of the Senate. It is a great honor to serve in the Senate; it is a great honor to represent the people of Maryland. Every Congress has tried to add to its record to protect the future generations as it relates to our environment. The protection of our environment has never been a partisan issue. I would urge our colleagues to find ways that we can work together to build the legacy of this Congress to further protect our environment for future generations. We should be part of the solution. Tomorrow is Earth Day. Let's make a difference. With what we see happening in New York and by our actions, let us protect future generations. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Alexander, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up the following first- degree amendments: Merkley amendment No. 3812, Reid amendment No. 3805, and Flake amendment No. 3820; further, that at 11 a.m., on Tuesday, April 26, the Senate vote on the amendments in the order listed and with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the votes, and that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2357-S2379] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2028, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Pending: Alexander/Feinstein amendment No. 3801, in the nature of a substitute. Alexander amendment No. 3804 (to amendment No. 3801), to modify provisions relating to Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees. Alexander (for Hoeven) amendment No. 3811 (to amendment No. 3801), to prohibit the use of funds relating to a certain definition. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Amendment No. 3811 Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I understand that shortly we are going to be voting on the Hoeven amendment. The Hoeven amendment would prevent the clean water rule from going into effect. In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act in response to what was happening around this country. We saw rivers literally catch on fire as a result of polluted waterways. We had Lake Erie, which was considered dead. The Chesapeake Bay was one of the world's first marine dead zones. That is nothing to be proud of. The environment and status of our water was a national disgrace, and through congressional leadership, we passed the Clean Water Act. We did that because we understood that the status of upstream water affects the status of downstream water--that we are all in this together. We understood that having clean water was a public health issue, from swimming in the water to the source of our drinking water supplies. One third of our drinking water supplies come from regulated waters. We also understood it was important for our economy. The status of tourism very much depended upon the quality of our water. Literally, people were concerned about going close to some of our inner harbor water areas. The Baltimore Inner Harbor is a tourist attraction, as are the inner harbors of many of our cities. It is important for our economy for agriculture. Agriculture depends upon clean water. We understood that when we passed the Clean Water Act in 1972. And we also understood it was a matter of quality of life for the people in our country. From those who hike and do bird watching to those who enjoy fishing and hunting, the status of clean water very much affects the way we enjoy life. As Senators from Maryland, Senator Mikulski and I both understand the importance of clean water for the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and the largest estuary in our hemisphere. It was at great risk because of waters coming in from other States into the Chesapeake Bay watershed, affecting the quality of water of the Chesapeake Bay. It was for all those reasons that we passed the 1972 Clean Water Act. We understood the enforcement of the waters that were regulated under the 1972 Clean Water Act. It was based upon best science. Science told us what we needed to do in order to have clean water-- clean water for our environment, clean water for safe drinking water-- and it was well understood until a Supreme Court decision. That decision in 2006, known as the Rapanos decision, was a 5-to-4 decision of the Supreme Court, which remanded the case, but it was a 4-to-4 decision on the merits of the case. Since that time, there has been uncertainty as to what bodies of water can be regulated under the Clean Water Act. So this was a situation caused by the ambiguity of the Supreme Court case. It is interesting that the decision on the merits was 4-to-4, as we are now debating whether we are going to have a full Supreme Court in order to make decisions that affect the clarity of law in this country. The Rapanos decision sent back to the lower courts a decision on how to decide this. Since that time, there has been uncertainty as to what bodies are legally regulated under the 1972 Clean Water Act. Remember, this was 2006. The easiest way to resolve this was for Congress to pass a law clarifying the Clean Water Act, but Congress has chosen not to do that. So the Obama administration has done what it should do, using its power to promulgate a regulation that would provide clarity as to which bodies of water are regulated. Guess what. They have done that in a way that is consistent with how the law was enforced prior to the Rapanos decision--without much complaint before the Rapanos decision. It basically goes back to best science and tells us logically what needs to be regulated. That is what this rule would do: Protect our clean water. There is a lot of misinformation that has been given about the clean water rule. Quite frankly, normal farming activities don't require any permits under the Clean Water Act. If we listen to some of the arguments against the Clean Water Act, we would have a hard time comparing that to what, in fact, is in the bill. The Clean Water Act would reestablish the well-thought regulatory framework for protecting our clean water so that we don't return to the days of jeopardizing the Chesapeake Bay or jeopardizing our rivers or jeopardizing our clean water supplies or our environment. Tomorrow is Earth Day. Forty-six years ago, our colleague Senator Gaylord Nelson established Earth Day. What will this Congress's legacy be? What will we be remembered for in regards to protecting this planet, protecting our country, and protecting our environment for future generations? I [[Page S2358]] hope we will work together to build on the proud accomplishments of our predecessors for clean air and clean water. The first thing we can do is to make sure we reject the Hoeven amendment. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. I am pleased to see Senators Alexander and Feinstein working to put together a good, bipartisan bill with no ideological or partisan policy riders. They remind us of the way that we should be doing business here in the Senate. This legislation provides increased funding for infrastructure across the Nation and in my home State of Illinois, and I was proud to support it in the Appropriations Committee. The bill provides strong funding for the National Labs through the Department of Energy, including critical research programs at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. These labs are supporting thousands of scientists from across the country and around the world as they perform pioneering research and transform technologies for science and industry. Lab facilities in Illinois perform cutting-edge research and are a bright example of American innovation. The Energy and Water Appropriations bill would invest $6 billion in the Army Corps of Engineers, which will help support important investments in Illinois infrastructure. Waterways in Illinois, including the Mississippi River, are critical to commerce around the country. They provide access for shipped goods, connecting the Great Lakes with the Gulf of Mexico. The Army Corps also plays an important role in flood control projects, something we saw firsthand in Illinois and across the Mississippi valley area after flooding this past winter. But there is always more work to be done. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, America scores a D-minus in investment in levees and inland waterways, and a D in investment in dams. This bill is a good start to making the critical investments we need in American infrastructure. So I am not sure why, after Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein pulled together such a strong bipartisan bill, Republicans would want to try to add a poison pill rider preventing an EPA rule that keeps our water clean. Many economists and military leaders tell us that water will be to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th century. Water is going to be that indispensable commodity that makes progress possible; an essential commodity over which wars will be fought. The United States has more clean water today than any other nation on the planet, and it is because of the Great Lakes. Why would we knowingly, deliberately, spoil this precious commodity that is a source of conflict between other nations? We can't afford to stop making a real difference in our clean water supply, and let me tell you why. The EPA and Army Corps clean water rule provides stronger water quality standards to protect our Nation's streams, wetlands, and navigable water. These are all resources that we rely heavily on for drinking water and recreation. And one in three Americans, or 117 million people, get drinking water from sources that were vulnerable to pollution before the clean water rule. Now, more than ever, we must work to ensure our water is safe. We know what can happen when our water supply isn't protected. The Flint, MI, water contamination crisis and high lead levels in the water supply in other communities across the country and in Illinois are reminders of this. But it is not just lead that we have to worry about. Pollutants from factories and sewage treatment plants; waste from confined animal feeding operations; pesticides used on crops; and mining wastewater all flow into tributaries that eventually flow into the Great Lakes, the source of clean water for 35 million people. Attempts to roll back the clean water rule will not only return us to a patchwork of water protections that make it difficult for businesses, farmers, and others to know whether waterways are covered by the law. It will also risk one of our greatest commodities that supports agriculture, recreation, tourism, and energy production. To see the impacts of rolling back these protections, we need to look no further than the Gulf of Mexico, which has one of the largest dead zones in the world. Let me tell you what a dead zone is: Dead zones are the result of an overabundance of algae growth, which eventually decompose and steal oxygen from the water, making it hard for anything to live. Nutrient runoff from 12 States along the Mississippi River trickles down into the Gulf of Mexico. Last year, the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico reached 6,474 square miles, roughly the size of the State of Connecticut. The State of Illinois was one of the largest contributors to this nutrient overload, a combination of runoff from our farm fields and point source pollution such as wastewater plants. We need to reduce this nutrient runoff while protecting our agriculture economy in Illinois. The clean water rule does exactly that by exempting agricultural activities from its provisions. I urge my colleagues to vote against any ideological poison pill amendment that would prevent clean water appropriations from moving forward to protect our children, our communities, and our economy. Without ideological riders like the clean water rule amendment, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill is a bipartisan effort that proves we can make smart investments that make the most sense for our country--right now and as we plan for our future. The current lead crisis has shown that we need to get serious about investing in infrastructure programs and support regulations to ensure that every American--especially children--has access to safe, clean drinking water. Now is the time for Congress to act responsibly to develop a budget that enables our country to thrive. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The Senator from Indiana. Wasteful Spending Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this is No. 40 of ``Waste of the Week.'' For the 40 weeks the Senate has been in session this cycle, I have come down to the Floor to talk about a waste of taxpayers' dollars through waste, fraud, and abuse. This week I am going to talk about yet another Federal program which has, at best, a questionable track record. I filed an amendment to the Energy and Water appropriations bill currently in the Senate, which is related to this program, and hopefully we will be voting on the amendment I will be offering in a few moments to address this issue. This amendment, which I offered with Senators Fischer, Toomey, and Flake, would finally wind down the Department of Energy's failed Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. Remember the stimulus? Remember how we were throwing all kinds of taxpayers' money out there? We talked about advanced vehicle programs, and many of these distributions of funds have been misused or simply have not come to fruition, and a great deal of money has been wasted. The ATVM Loan Program continues to sit on billions of dollars of unused funds that could be put to better use. I am glad there are some unused funds there because it means that when we look at the history of this program, perhaps we will have an opportunity to better use those unused funds or to help return it back to the Treasury so the taxpayer isn't on the hook for this kind of thing going forward. Let me explain this program. The Department of Energy's Advanced Vehicle Technology Manufacturing Loan Program was created in 2007. It was created to provide very low-interest loans to manufacturers that make vehicles or components of vehicles that use alternative energy. I am not here to downplay the use of alternative energy. I think that is something that is happening throughout our country. Hopefully, it is on a market basis. To qualify for this loan, there were a couple of requirements applicants must meet: No. 1, the vehicle or component must be new or significantly improved from what is currently available in the U.S. marketplace; No. 2, it has to be manufactured in the United States. The purpose of the program, partly, was to encourage manufacturing here--not in China, not somewhere else. [[Page S2359]] Last month, nearly 10 years since the program's inception, the Government Accountability Office took a look at the program's finances and found that the Department of Energy has billions of unused and unspent funds. I am glad they do because a lot of things that have taken place under this program have not proven to be worth their weight. I have spoken before on a number of programs, but in 2011, under this fund--the Alternative Vehicle Fund--the Obama administration approved a $730 million loan to a company called Severstal Steel Company, a Russian-owned company with operations in Michigan. Remember, to qualify for this loan, the alternative fuel vehicle or vehicle part needs to be manufactured in the United States and--here is the key--it must be a new product. Technically, Severstal was manufacturing in the United States, but the Obama administration certainly walked the line in this case. The U.S. Government was providing American taxpayer dollars to a Russian company owned by one of Russia's richest oligarchs, Alexei Mordashov. The New York Times has reported that Mr. Mordashov has ties to the Kremlin and to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Apparently, this Russian looked at this program and said: Hey, here is a way I can get a low-cost, low-interest loan. All I have to do is operate this plant and the government will loan me $750 million and I will produce a new part, a new component of steel that is used in automobile manufacturing. After working with the Department of Energy's inspector general, Senator Toomey and I learned that the type of steel made by this Russian company was identical to the steel already being produced in my home State of Indiana and Senator Toomey's home State of Pennsylvania. Obviously, that violated one of the basic criteria in that the product has to be an alternative that is brand new or significantly improved and not something that is already being produced in Indiana. Fortunately, with the help of the inspector general, we were able to ensure the Obama administration voided the loan. To their credit, when we brought it to their attention, they said: OK. We have a Russian oligarch we are giving money to--and that doesn't sound very good. We are giving money to this multibillionaire in Russia with close ties to Vladimir Putin. Secondly, we now have learned what they are producing is already produced in the United States--in my State of Indiana and in Senator Toomey's State of Pennsylvania. Thus, fortunately, the administration canceled this loan. This example calls into question the integrity of this program. The ATVM Program also has a lackluster success rate. For example, Fisker Automotive received a $529 million loan to produce a $100,000 plug-in hybrid sports car. You will not see any of these on the road because the company went bankrupt after drawing down $193 million of taxpayer funds. Another loan recipient, VPG, planned to sell natural gas-powered vans. It went bankrupt after receiving a $50 million government loan. Of the five projects funded by this program to date, two of them have gone bankrupt. I think these examples demonstrate what happens when the government tries to pick winners and losers instead of letting the free market determine how we are going to go forward. The Coats-Fischer-Flake-Toomey amendment that will be offered would wind down this program and it would make much better use of the unspent funds from this program. I want to be clear. This amendment prohibits DOE from reviewing any new loan applications after the bill's enactment. There are currently some pending applications. We do not address those pending applications. I hope serious evaluation will be made relative to whether they qualify under the criteria that is laid out and we will not end up with any more Severstals. Those who argue that this shuts down an alternative energy program is not valid. Anything that is now being currently evaluated up through the end of 2020, the next 5 years--will be allowed to go forward and be evaluated under the program. The amendment doesn't take that away. CBO scored this amendment as saving at least $300 million over the next 10 years. I have been down here every week talking about a waste of the week. I have just identified another waste of taxpayer dollars. We are not counting that, but we are counting what we can save if this amendment is adopted. It is $300 million. I think that is a significant amount it raises our waste, fraud, and abuse level to $162 billion and change. I encourage my colleagues to work with us so we can offer this amendment. Remember, it does not affect anybody who has a proposal before the Department of Energy under this loan program. If that is underway, it can be evaluated--hopefully successfully evaluated, and if it doesn't qualify the criteria, won't be accepted. The amendment does not free funds for anything that is not currently before the evaluators of this program. I trust we can gain the support of my colleagues in saving the taxpayers some dollars. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3811 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are going to vote on the Hoeven amendment shortly. I rise to speak against that amendment, which would undermine one of our Nation's landmark environmental laws, the Clean Water Act. It is very difficult for me to understand how we could be at this point in time attacking a clean water rule--a clean water rule in light of what has happened in Flint, MI. This is what the water looked like as it came out of the tap in Flint at the height of the crisis. By the way, people were told this was safe. Why on Earth would we be going against the clean water rule at a time when we are fighting against this kind of problem? This is what the pipes looked like in Flint: the corrosion, the obvious problems with lead. This was all getting right into the drinking water. While we look for ways to help the people of Flint--and I would love do it on this bill. If we can't do it on this bill, I would love do it on the WRDA bill. If we can't do it on the WRDA bill, I will do it on any bill. We need to take care of what happened there, and we also need to help other communities from the east coast to the middle of our Nation, to the west coast and help us help our families. Here we have in the face of Flint an attack on the clean water rule. Let's see what else we have to say and what else we learned about what happened in Flint. Pregnant women, kids cautioned over Jackson water. This is in Mississippi. Jackson, MS, also has a problem with lead. What is our response to that today? To stop a clean water rule. What are my Republican friends thinking? It doesn't make sense. The Associated Press wrote this: ``Elevated lead levels found in Newark schools' drinking water.'' Here we are talking about elevated levels of lead in Newark. We have places in California where the kids can't drink the water out of a water fountain. So what is the response of the Republican Senate? Turn back a clean water rule. It makes absolutely no sense. What we have going on, on the Senate floor, is a very heated debate, as I speak, about how to handle the issue in Flint. Let me tell you this. The first thing to do in the light of Flint is not to weaken environmental law, is not to stop a clean water rule. It is completely ridiculous. My friends will say: All we are doing is delaying implementation for a year while the court looks at it. We shouldn't be doing anything that plays into the hands of those special interests that simply don't want to clean up the water in our Nation. The clean water standards that are a target of this amendment are designed to safeguard drinking water for America's families and businesses. This dangerous amendment rolls back protections of small streams and wetlands that provide drinking water to one in three Americans. That is 117 million people put at risk because this U.S. Senate, run by the Republicans, [[Page S2360]] thinks the best thing to do in the light of Flint is to roll back the Clean Water Act. Come on. Get a life. Read the paper. Look at what happened to those people. This is the time to provide reliable drinking water to all Americans and to clean up our waterways. Now is not the time--and it should not be the time--to attack the Clean Water Act, which is vital to the health and safety of our families. I want to mention that I have received opposition to the Hoeven amendment from numerous sportsmen's groups, including Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, International Federation of Fly Fishers, National Wildlife Federation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, and Trout Unlimited. These groups understand the important link between clean water and the outdoor recreation economy. When you go right after the clean water rule, you are going after the people who enjoy outdoor recreation, and they are against the Hoeven amendment. Leading environmental and conservation groups oppose the amendment, including American Rivers, Clean Water Action, Earthjustice, Earthworks, Environment America, Environmental Defense Fund, League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council, Prairie Rivers Network, Sierra Club, and Southern Environmental Law Center. These are some of the most popular groups in the country. Does anyone know what the rating of this Republican Congress was in the last polls I saw? It was 14 percent. Do you know what the rating of the President was in the last poll I saw? Over 50. So what does the Republican Senate do today? They are going after the President with their 14-percent rating in the polls. I say to my friends on the other side--and believe me, they are my friends: What are you doing? How do you expect people to support you when you, after seeing what happened in Flint, continue to go after landmark environmental clean water laws like you are doing today? In addition, public health groups, including the American Public Health Association, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Trust for America's Health, have opposed similar legislation to block this important rule, and 200,000 businesses represented by the American Sustainable Business Council have called on Senators to oppose efforts to block the clean water rule. These experts understand the importance of the clean water rule, and they know that our drinking water remains vulnerable to pollution. Just last month, EPA released a report showing that nearly half of U.S. waterways are in poor condition. In fact, one in four waterways have levels of bacteria that fail to meet human health standards, and our children go swimming in these very waterways. We have cities across the United States with sewer systems that discharge raw, untreated sewage in waterways--again, where our children swim. It is a disgrace. Despite enormous successes since passage of the Clean Water Act, we have more work to do. Nothing is more important than protecting the lives of the American people, whether it is through our military or through our public health laws. When we weaken the Clean Water Act, as the Hoeven amendment will do, we put our families and our children at risk. Why are we here? Flint has put a spotlight on the need to keep our families safe from toxins and pollutants in their drinking water. The first thing the Republicans do in light of Flint is to try to roll back the clean water rule. I have to say that one of my deepest regrets--and I have written about it--is how partisan this place has become over environmental laws. When I started a long time ago, Republicans were the ones leading the way on the environment. I remember there was a Republican State senator named Peter Behr, whom I supported because he understood how critical it was to protect and defend the environment, not only as a legacy to our children in terms of the beauty of our planet but also for the very health and safety of our families. I have been in office for 40 years. It is hard to believe that it has been 40 years. I guess time flies when you like your work. The fact is that no one has ever come up to me and said: Barbara, our water and air is too pure and way too clean. You need to do something about that. You need to dirty it up. Repeal the landmark laws, Barbara, that protect our water. They don't do that. They come up and say: We are worried about the fact that we are not sure what contaminants are in our water. I see my good friend is going to close out the debate, and I promised him that when he came to the floor, he wouldn't have to listen too long. I say again: Please vote against the Hoeven amendment. This is not smart legislation in light of what we face. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I will yield the floor to the good Senator from Michigan for a minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wanted to make a quick statement about an amendment that will come up for consideration on the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, of course I support my friend from Michigan, but we need to quickly move to a vote on the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wanted to quickly take a moment to speak about the vehicle program from two sides. When I authored this legislation back in 2007, we began to see fuel economy standards increase in the United States. Part of our focus at that time was to keep jobs in America and make sure we had low-cost financing available for companies, such as retool plants, so that smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles would be made in the United States rather than have those jobs shipped overseas. We saw that with the initial loan made to Ford Motor Company. They were able to bring jobs back from Mexico and also focus on electric vehicles. As we fast forward to today, we are looking at fuel economy for trucks and larger vehicles. A loan was recently made to Alcoa. They are focused on aluminum materials so companies can make lighter weight trucks in order to meet new fuel economy standards. There are positives, but there are also areas under this loan program that have not been successful. I come to the floor to specifically say that when it is time to consider the Coats amendment, which will completely eliminate this program, my colleagues need to know that we are undercutting a carefully crafted bipartisan compromise with Senator Inhofe, Senator Portman, and others to move forward on a water infrastructure plan to deal with lead in water that will not only help 100,000 people in the city of Flint, but it will also help people in Jackson, MS, Cleveland, OH, and other States across the country. Our proposal responsibly phases out this program and uses the funds for critical water infrastructure needs. We strongly oppose pulling the rug out from under not only Flint but also Jackson, MS, Cleveland, OH, and communities across the country that are counting on us to come together and pass what we have done in a bipartisan way to address critical water infrastructure needs and deal with the lead poisoning issues. I ask colleagues to vote no on the Coats amendment and allow us to phase out this program in a way so that we will be able to use this investment in a critical way to address water infrastructure needs across the country. I thank the Presiding Officer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am willing to yield to the junior Senator from Michigan. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I concur with my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow. We urge our colleagues [[Page S2361]] to vote no on the Coats amendment. This is part of a very carefully crafted amendment to deal with water infrastructure around the country, and in particular Flint. I think this will be a win-win for those folks who may want to see this program go away. We have a plan to do that while also dealing with an incredibly important issue not only for our State but that is also incredibly important to other States across the country. I urge a ``no'' vote. I thank the Senator for yielding the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Amendment No. 3811 Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support an amendment I offered, amendment No. 3811, that prevents the EPA and the Corps of Engineers from implementing its waters of the United States final rule. The language for my amendment is actually identical to the waters of the United States provision in the underlying bill. It is already in the bill, H.R. 2028, which we are considering right now. My amendment will make sure that this waters of the United States provision stays in the bill and that our bill is consistent with legislation supported by the House. It is critical to preserve the prohibition on implementing the waters of the United States because this rule will greatly expand the scope of EPA regulations over nearly every water in the United States, threatening farmers and job creators with permitting requirements and litigation that will make it more difficult for them to produce our Nation's food and complete needed construction projects. Moreover, this regulatory overreach by the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA is inconsistent with the law. Let's look at what the courts are saying. When granting a preliminary injunction against this rule, the North Dakota Federal District Court stated: The Rule allows EPA regulation of waters that do not bear any effect on the ``chemical, physical and biological integrity'' of any navigable-in-fact water. It went on further to state: The rule asserts jurisdiction over waters that are remote and intermittent waters. No evidence actually points to how these intermittent and remote wetlands have any nexus to navigable-in-fact water. That is the key. EPA has jurisdiction over navigable bodies of water, not ephemeral water that might be in a ditch today and gone tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a nationwide stay of the rule, in Cincinnati, citing that EPA and the Corps of Engineers did not identify ``specific scientific support substantiating the reasonableness of the bright-line standards they ultimately chose.'' To get a sense of the size of the Federal power grab we are talking about here, consider that under the administration's final rule, all water located within 4,000 feet of any other water or within the 100- year floodplain is considered a water of the United States as long as the EPA or the Army Corps of Engineers decides that it has ``significant nexus.'' That is the argument the EPA is making-- ``significant nexus.'' They are saying: Well, we can regulate navigable bodies of water. They just decided, without statutory authority provided by this Congress or any other authority, that because other waters run into navigable bodies, they can regulate all water, and they have issued a regulation to do that. The waters of the United States is clearly flawed from a legal perspective, but it is even more important to take a look at how this rule, if implemented, affects hard-working Americans with excessive regulations. For those of you who haven't had the opportunity to visit with a farmer from my State or any farmers across this country, do so. They will tell you how difficult it is to deal with excess water on their property, particularly when they face an overbearing regulation like this one. Those farmers can tell you that just because there is water in a ditch or field one week doesn't mean that there will be water there next week. It certainly doesn't make the water worthy of being treated the same as a river, a lake, or a navigable body of water. A field with a low spot that has standing water---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask that the Members of this body not only consider the underlying issue and the impact it will have on farmers and ranchers. It will also affect everybody's private property rights. I also ask my colleagues to consider their own prerogative. Under our Constitution we have legislative, judicial, and executive branches, and each has its own authority. We have to stand up on this one when an agency overreaches and takes statutory authority we have not provided. I ask that Members join with me in support of this vitally important amendment. With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following locking in the votes, the Senator from California have an opportunity to speak and then that we move to the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up the following amendments: Franken amendment No. 3833, Coats amendment No. 3814, and Murray amendment No. 3813; further, that following the disposition of the Hoeven amendment No. 3811, the Senate vote on the Coats amendment No. 3814, with a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption of the amendment; and that at 1:45 p.m. today, the Senate vote on the Franken amendment No. 3833; finally, that at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, April 25, the Senate vote on the Murray amendment No. 3813, with no second-degree amendments in order to any of the amendments prior to the votes, and that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote. May I say before the Senator from California speaks, I see the Senators from Michigan are here and the Senator from Indiana. I wish to thank the three of them for working with Senator Feinstein and me toward the goal of making sure that Senators who have a germane amendment have the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote. If we are able to follow that practice generally, we will be able to have an appropriations process and the Senate will function well. They all responded quickly and promptly on issues they feel very strongly about, and I thank them for it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from California. Amendment No. 3811 Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words. The junior Senator from California has been speaking in opposition to the waters of the United States amendment sponsored by Senator Hoeven. I just want to put before the body a little bit of the history. In 2006 the Supreme Court introduced real uncertainty regarding which wetlands and water bodies were subject to Federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Since 2006 the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been working on new rules to clarify their jurisdiction and address the Supreme Court's ruling. EPA and the Army Corps just finalized the new rule last May. This new rule helps resolve almost a decade of confusion by clearly stating which types of water bodies are subject to Federal jurisdiction and which are not. It will make Federal permitting easier, faster, and less costly for business and industry. It maintains all previous exemptions and exclusions for normal farming and ranching practices and agricultural discharges, such as irrigation return flow and storm water runoff. Nevertheless, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has issued a stay suspending implementation of the rule. I strongly believe we should let the courts decide whether the executive branch has overreached in its interpretation of congressional statute, just like the Constitution calls for. The President has threatened to veto the entire Energy and Water appropriations bill if this amendment is included in it. Right now, we have the best opportunity in 7 years to pass this bill as a stand-alone piece of legislation and [[Page S2362]] get the Senate appropriations process working again. So I am very hopeful and would strongly recommend that the Senate defeat the Hoeven amendment. Thank you very much, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Hoeven amendment No. 3811. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 42, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 57 Leg.] YEAS--56 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Coats Cochran Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Grassley Hatch Heitkamp Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kirk Lankford Lee Manchin McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Wicker NAYS--42 Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Collins Coons Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Heinrich Hirono Kaine King Klobuchar Leahy Markey Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Reed Reid Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wyden NOT VOTING--2 Cruz Sanders The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in a moment Senator Coats will call up his amendment, the Coats and Toomey amendment. I want to thank the Michigan Senators and others for making the schedule work today. For the information of all Senators, after the Coats amendment, the next vote will be at 1:45 p.m. on the Franken amendment. That will be the last vote today. The next vote will be on the Murray amendment on Monday afternoon. Senators and their staffs have been very good about getting their amendments in. We think we have all the amendments. We have asked to have them by 1 p.m. so we could by consensus finish up on Monday and Tuesday, giving everybody a chance to have their vote if it is a germane amendment and to speak on the germane amendments. My request on behalf of Senator Feinstein and me is that if there are any amendments still out there, we would like to have them by 1 o'clock. Amendment No. 3814 to Amendment No. 3801 The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 3814, to be offered by the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Coats. Mr. COATS. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3814. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] proposes an amendment numbered 3814 to amendment No. 3801. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To limit the use of funds made available for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program) On page 30, line 9, strike the period at the end and insert the following: ``: Provided, That none of the funds made available under this heading shall be used to administer, review, or approve any loan or loan application that was not submitted as of the date of enactment of this Act: Provided further, that none of the funds available to the Secretary of Energy to provide any credit subsidy under subsection (d) of section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17013) as of the date of enactment of this Act shall be obligated for new loan commitments under that subsection on or after October 1, 2020.''. Mr. COATS. Madam President, 205 loans issued by the Department of Energy under the alternative vehicle program have failed, costing taxpayers $500 million in losses. DOE currently sits on $4 billion of unused money. It is time to wind down this program. This will not affect any proposals that are currently with the Department of Energy on this program, but it will prevent any new programs going forward. We can save the taxpayers a lot of money and use this for other alternatives if we adopt this amendment. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Pennsylvania. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, this is exactly the kind of program our constituents hate. It is the crony capitalism where taxpayers are forced to subsidize preferred companies, special interests. How many hundreds of millions of dollars do taxpayers have to lose? I understand there is some discussion that maybe on some bill in the future, this will get phased out as part of another deal, but who knows if that is ever going to happen. Here is a chance to wipe out some crony capitalism, some corporate welfare, and a huge loss for taxpayers. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. TOOMEY. Let's adopt this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I would certainly urge all of my colleagues to oppose the Coats amendment. What this does is eliminate a program that basically pays for a very carefully crafted agreement on which we are working to deal with the Flint water issue, as well as water infrastructure issues all across this country. This is part of the proposal Senator Stabenow and I have been working on and have been building support. We are looking to move to this very shortly to deal with this broad issue. A vote against this amendment allows us to continue to move forward with a bipartisan plan, critical for our whole country. I yield my remaining time to the senior Senator from Michigan. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, the bottom line is that we have developed a bipartisan bill that phases out this program in a responsible way for the businesses that are currently involved and uses that to pay for water infrastructure needs across the country, not only in Flint but in Jackson, MI, and Cleveland, OH--across the country. So we can achieve what the Senators are talking about in a way that helps us with water infrastructure. I urge a ``no'' vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3814. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 49, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 58 Leg.] YEAS--48 Ayotte Barrasso Boozman Burr Capito Coats Cochran Collins Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner [[Page S2363]] Graham Grassley Hatch Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kirk Lankford Lee McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Paul Perdue Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Wicker NAYS--49 Alexander Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coons Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Kaine King Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murkowski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Portman Reed Reid Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wyden NOT VOTING--3 Blunt Cruz Sanders The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. The Senator from Arizona. Tribute to Sandy Ledy Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Sandy Ledy, a dedicated Senate staff member who will retire after more than two decades of public service in my office. Soon after being elected to the Senate in 1994, Senator John Kyl was wise enough to offer Sandy--a standout campaign volunteer--a job on his new staff. Sandy was given two options: She could work as a staffer in Washington, DC, or she could serve in Arizona and serve as John Kyl's military case worker. Sandy knew she couldn't pass up an opportunity to serve those who serve our Nation. It was an easy decision for Sandy and a fortuitous one for Arizona's military servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Sandy's genuine passion for our military service men and women, combined with her meticulous approach to her work, has made her an invaluable staffer. Sandy is well-versed in all things military, from regulations, to benefits, to the service academies. Her vast knowledge has ensured that Arizona's military service men and women have had nothing but the best assistance for more than the past two decades. Her reputation preceded her, and when I was elected as Senator in 2012, I had an easy decision of my own--offering Sandy a job on my staff. Thankfully, she said yes. Sandy is probably best known around the State as the point person for service academy nominations. Her understanding of that process and what it takes for a student to be an excellent nominee has helped so many students fulfill their dreams of attending one of our prestigious service academies. Her focus on preparation and attention to detail has turned what can be a very daunting task into a seamless production, resulting in countless nominations and appointments to the service academies. While we all marvel at Sandy's meticulousness, it is her compassion and calm demeanor that make her such an asset. This is never more evident than when she is working with students and parents in the long and complicated process of applying to attend one of these service academies. Beyond her work on behalf of the military, she is an active and cherished member of her community in Cave Creek, AZ. She is a member of her church choir, a regular volunteer at the Cave Creek Museum, and a longtime swim coach, sometimes judging local meets. But there is no better testament to Sandy's example as a public servant than her two children, Amy and Joe. Amy is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy who herself recently retired after a career in the military. Joe served in the U.S. Marine Corps. They have made her the proud grandmother of three, and she is looking forward to spending a well-deserved retirement looking after those grandkids. Sandy, thank you for more than 20 years of dedicated public service in the Senate and, in particular, for the 4 years of stellar service as a member of my staff. Your knowledge and passion will be greatly missed. I wish you well in your retirement. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am on the floor with my colleague Senator Portman to join him in urging the House to take prompt action on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which passed with such a stunning bipartisan vote in the Senate. As Senator Portman has pointed out, years of careful preparation went into the drafting of this bill. There were five separate national hearings held in Washington with people from all over the country. This is a very polished and carefully developed piece of legislative work that has the support not only of the addiction and recovery community but of the law enforcement community and many others. Senator Portman has been very diligent about coming to the floor to press for action from the House of Representatives. My view is that since the House of Representatives is under Republican control, they are more likely to be attentive to the urgings of a Republican Senator--particularly one who has served in the House of Representatives--than they are to me. But I want to make sure the record is clear that I fully support rapid passage of this bill, whether it is something that is close enough that we can quickly get it through conference or whether it is our bill, to which they are free to add things as they wish over time, but can get to the President now--the reason I think it is important that it get to the President now is we are in the appropriations process. The appropriators for these accounts need to know what they are appropriating to. So time is of the essence, not just because of the lives that are being lost day-to-day and month-to-month out there but also because our appropriators need to know. I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives, Democrats and Republicans alike, to listen to the distinguished Senator from Ohio. Let's try to get this done. With that, I yield to Senator Portman with my thanks and appreciation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. First, Madam President, I want to thank my colleague from Rhode Island who just spoke. We did work together for the past few years in putting together this legislation, and we did it, by the way, with the House of Representatives. So Senator Whitehouse and I took good ideas wherever we could find them, in whatever part of the country it came from, including ideas from the House of Representatives. We didn't ask who had the idea; we asked whether it was a good idea. We kept this entirely nonpartisan, not just bipartisan. Therefore, we built something that makes sense for our communities back home to deal with this epidemic of prescription drug and heroin addiction and overdoses. I appreciate his partnership in this, and I appreciate the fact that he came to the floor today to talk about the importance of moving ahead with this legislation. After all, it is very rare around here to get a 94-to-1 vote on anything, and we did it on this bill. After 2\1/2\ weeks on the floor of the Senate talking about this heroin and prescription drug epidemic, every single Senator here realized this was a problem in their States, and 94 Senators stood up and agreed this legislation will help address it. By the way, since we passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, as it is called, on March 10 in the Senate, 42 days have passed. That is more than a month. Every day, we lose about 120 Americans--120 Americans--to drug overdoses. That means in these 42 days we have lost over 5,000 fellow American citizens to drug overdoses. Think about that. I do urge the House to act and act quickly. These numbers keep getting higher and higher. This is not getting better. Back in Ohio, this is getting worse, and I assume the same is true in your State, if you are a Senator or if you are a Member of the House of Representatives in your district. Since 2007, we have looked at these numbers, and drug overdoses have killed more Ohioans than car accidents. It is now the No. 1 cause of accidental death in Ohio. It has tripled [[Page S2364]] from 1999 to 2010. We are now told, by the way, that 200,000 Ohioans are addicted to opioids--opioids are prescription drugs--and heroin-- 200,000 Ohioans. That is the size of a significant city in any State represented here in this body or any district on the other side. In fact, it is the same size as the city of Akron, OH, where I was on Monday of this week, meeting with their opioid task force. They are alarmed at what is happening, and they want to be sure we are making every possible effort we can on the prevention side, the education side, to get more people into treatment, to get them into longer term recovery, to provide police officers and other first responders with Narcan, the miracle drug they need to stop overdoses from turning into a death. They want our help. They support the CARA legislation. They need it, and they need it now. The Cincinnati Enquirer had some really troubling news last week. They wrote a story about a new poll that is out. It is a group called Interact for Health. They do an annual Ohio health issues poll. They found in the poll in 2014 that 2 of every 10 Ohioans knew someone who was abusing prescription drugs. A year later, it is 3 in 10, so this is not getting better. This is getting worse. By the way, this is just prescription drugs. And by the way, of the 3 in 10 who knew somebody who is abusing prescription drugs, 4 in 10--4 in 10--knew somebody who had overdosed on those prescription drugs. So these percentages are increasing across the board--every age group, every education level, every income level. There is no demographic, no ZIP Code, no State, no city, and no county that is safe from this epidemic. It is spreading, and it is spreading everywhere. This poll is another indication that we have a lot of work to do. This should be a motivation for us. This should get us to pass this legislation. And, yes, can we work on additional legislation? Of course, we can and should. I am encouraged that the House is taking up new bills and looking at this in different ways. That is good. But we know here in the Senate and over in the House that this CARA legislation will help and will help now. By the way, there are over 120 cosponsors of the CARA legislation in the House. Not only did we work with them and introduce identical legislation in the House and the Senate, anticipating this day when we could pass it in one House, but we wanted to pass it quickly in the other House and get it to the President for his signature. There are over 120 cosponsors over there. It is bipartisan. Think of the impact we could have on the community if we could get this passed. If we could turn around just one life, it matters, and we know this can save many lives and make many people begin to look at this issue differently--that this is a disease. Addiction is a disease and needs to be treated as such. Removing some of that stigma alone will bring a lot more people into treatment, and that is part of what is important about this legislation. There is another issue that is not prescription drugs, and it is not heroin, but it is another issue related to it, and that is fentanyl. Fentanyl is being laced with heroin throughout the country. In Cleveland, OH, a couple of weeks ago, we lost 12 people--12 people--in 6 days to overdoses. That is one city. This was heroin, but it was laced with this even more dangerous toxic substance called fentanyl. By the way, it comes in the mail. The drug dealers are shipping it in the mail. Fentanyl is so toxic--10 to 30 to 40 times more toxic than heroin-- that it is dangerous even to open up the mail if you are an inspector, we are told. We had a hearing on this just this week. We talked to the Customs and Border Patrol people: Our question was, Why can't we stop this stuff from coming in? This, unfortunately, is something that is also increasing. Ohio, they say, is one of the top States in the country in terms of fentanyl overdoses. But I will tell those who have not dealt with this fentanyl issue yet that it creates even more issues because it is so deadly. After 3 years of work on this CARA legislation, Senator Whitehouse and I and others, including Senators on both sides of the aisle--we did hold five forums, as he said, on various aspects of this debate. We consulted with the experts on treatment and recovery, the experts who are focused on how to keep kids and other people from making these bad decisions in the prevention and the education community. We met with the drug experts from the administration, such as the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. We brought in people from all over the country, including from my home State of Ohio. This is the third time I have come to the floor. I have come once every week that we have been in session since we passed it to say to the House: Let's move on CARA. Let's get it done. It will help immediately. The majority leader in the House has said he wants the House to take on the drug epidemic and pass legislation soon. I believe him. He is a good man. I appreciate that. But I would ask him again to please work on the other legislation. It is fine to take them through hearings and markups, but we cannot delay. We know CARA will work, and it will work now. It is sitting over there and ready for action. It can be taken to the floor immediately under suspension and can be passed. We are one vote away from having this go to the President and having it go to help in our communities. The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Fred Upton, who is a good friend and a man with a big heart and cares about this issue, has said he would like the House to move quickly with, as he said, an ``all hands on deck effort.'' Good for him. One of his subcommittees, the Health Subcommittee, recently marked up a dozen bills. This happened yesterday; they marked up 12 bills. Look at those bills. A number of them are actually a part of CARA already. They are in CARA. They are smaller bills. None of them is comprehensive, like CARA. One reason we have to get CARA passed is this is a problem that has to be addressed from all angles, from all sectors, and that is why it has to be comprehensive. But of those 12 bills that were marked up yesterday, many of them are identical, and others are very similar to the CARA legislation. So this shouldn't slow us down. In fact, it is even more an indication that if these are the kinds of bills the House thinks are the right way to go, let's get CARA passed and then we can work on the other legislative ideas Members may have. I respect my colleagues--Chairman Upton, the majority leader over there, and Chairman Pence, the chairman of the subcommittee and also a guy who cares a lot about this issue--but let's give CARA a vote. There are 125 cosponsors. That is the latest number I have as of this morning, and the number keeps growing. It is bipartisan, it is bicameral, and it is the right thing to do. Again, I know there are other ideas out there, and that is fine. We need to take those up as well. But let's go ahead and get this passed. Put it under suspension, and take it to the floor. It will pass. We are one vote away from having this help our communities. CARA is not just comprehensive; it does the right thing in terms of focusing on what is evidence based. In other words, we didn't just say ``Let's throw more money at this problem,'' we said ``Let's actually find out what is working and what is not working.'' I was in Dayton, OH, with a group called Project C.U.R.E. on Friday. I had the chance to visit with some of the administrators there, some of the recovery coaches, as they call themselves, many of whom, by the way, are recovering themselves. They are doing an amazing job. I talked to many of the patients who were there. They are people who are recovering addicts. Some have been clean for 2 weeks, some clean for 2 years. But I asked them the same question I ask all over our State: What works? What doesn't work? How did this happen? Most of them, by the way, told me the same story you hear time and again: It started with prescription drugs. In fact, one story was from a man by the name of Anthony. He dropped out of high school at age 14, got into drugs, and made some mistakes in his life, which he readily acknowledges. He ended up in prison. He said he had eight convictions and was in and out of prison, in and out of the drug world. He decided to go straight. [[Page S2365]] He made a decision. For him, a lot of it was faith based and a lot was being sure he was going to be able to take care of his family and be a contributing member of his community, so he gave back. Anthony had a good job, had gotten married, and was on the right track. He was on his way to work one day, and he was in a car accident. For those experts who are listening to this today, you probably know happened. I don't even have to tell you. When he got in the car accident, he was injured. They sent him to the hospital. What did they give him at the hospital? Narcotic pain pills, Percocet, prescription drugs. Immediately--immediately--Anthony became addicted again. He is now struggling, but he is back at the treatment center. He is getting his life back together again. But in the meantime he has lost his family because the drugs became everything. He lost his job because the drugs became everything. We talk a lot about the overdoses, and they are horrible--120 Americans a day. We don't talk enough about those who aren't overdosing but who have lost their ability to achieve their own God-given purpose in life because the drugs are everything. So they have lost their families--torn apart. They have lost their jobs. They have lost their ability to be contributing members of our society. And those people who get into treatment and longer term recovery, as Anthony is doing, can turn their lives around. There is hope. It can work. Anthony is back for a second chance. Having talked to him, I believe he is not just on the right track but he will work through this. This legislation is needed to help him. When I do meet with recovering addicts, I ask them to look at the legislation, look at the summaries, and tell me what they think. What they tell me is they like it because they are convinced it would help others to have the access to treatment they have. Probably only 1 out of 10 of those people who are addicted are getting treatment. That is the best number I have. Maybe it is a little higher than that in your State or congressional district, but this is an issue where, if we provide more resources for treatment and begin to remove that stigma around treatment and get more people into a system where they can begin to get their lives back together with treatment, we know that works. Our legislation supports veterans task forces and veterans courts because we know this will help with our veterans who are coming back with PTSD, 20 percent of whom have this addiction. People say it is self-medicating. They have self-medicated to the point that they are now addicts. We need to put them not into a prison cell but into a treatment program. That is what these veterans courts do, and they surround these veterans with other veterans. They do an awesome job. I have been to them in Ohio. You have them probably in your State. If you don't, this legislation will help because it creates more veterans courts. We have talked on the floor before about the fact that there has been a huge increase--a 750 percent increase in the State of Ohio--in babies born with addiction. That is just in the last 12 years in Ohio. Go to any neonatal unit in your State or congressional district, and you will see these babies. They are being lovingly cared for by doctors and nurses. They are taking these addicted babies you could hold in the palm of your hand, and they are literally taking them through withdrawal. They have to because these babies are addicted and showing the symptoms you might see in an adult of addiction. We don't know what the long-term consequences are. We are having a hearing on this tomorrow in Cleveland, OH, at one of our great hospitals--University Hospitals Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital. It is one of the best children's hospitals in the country. Their neonatal unit is doing awesome work. I have been there and seen it. We are going to talk to the experts about this and how we can do even better to help these babies. But wouldn't it be great if we didn't have so many babies born with addiction because mothers, knowing the consequences, dealt with their addiction problem to avoid it through prevention and education efforts? Wouldn't it be great if we didn't have this 750-percent increase in children whose futures are uncertain because of being born with this addiction? Again, there is hope. I have been to a women's recovery center in Cleveland and Columbus and also in Eastern Ohio and Athens, OH, where I have met with women in long-term recovery with drug addiction. They are there with their kids. There is hope. With this legislation, we do have the ability to give people more hope. Getting rid of that stigma, not judging people, is part of beating this epidemic, and CARA will do that by treating addiction like a disease. There is an opportunity for us to move, and move quickly, to address this growing crisis we have in our States and our communities; that is, to pass this CARA legislation. Is it all we should do? No. Of course we should do more. I know the House of Representatives will have some great ideas. I know there are some great ideas in this body. The HELP Committee is working on additional ideas on how to get more medicine into this area of addiction, science, and treatment. They are working on ways to ensure that we can provide more help to people. That is great, and we should continue to work on that. Meanwhile, we know this legislation will help. We know that if it is sitting on the desk in the House of Representatives, having passed the Senate by a 94-to-1 vote, it is not going to help. But we know if it can get off the desk and onto the floor for a vote, we are one vote away from getting it to our communities to begin to help, to keep people from making the wrong decision--but then if they get into a drug addiction, it can help them to be able to turn their lives around and to achieve their potential in life, their God-given potential. That is what this argument is about. It is not about the fact that the Senate has all the answers. By the way, we wrote this legislation with the House. They were engaged from the start. We introduced identical bills and they had 125 cosponsors. All we are saying is, let's let this one piece of legislation go, let's allow it to begin to help right away, and then let's continue to work on other ideas. Again, we have lost nearly 5,000 Americans to drug overdoses since the Senate passed CARA with a 94-to-1 vote. To begin to reverse this tide--this trend of addiction, of overdoses--we can and should act now. It is urgent. There is a crisis. There is no time to waste. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wish to thank my friend for his comments about addiction. I agree with the Senator from Ohio, talking about the victims from Ohio. I can assure him we have victims in Virginia and all across the country, and we need to get this legislation to the President's desk so people who are hurt by the scourge of drugs can get the treatment they need. Again, I thank him for his leadership. Nomination of Merrick Garland Madam President, I rise to again express my disappointment that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have continued to obstruct consideration of an eminently qualified candidate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. It has now been 36 days since President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland; that is, 36 days that our highest Court has been relegated to falling short of its full constitutional obligations. Make no mistake. The Senate's inaction is already having a tangible impact on the Court's ability to function effectively. During the current session, we have seen our eight current Justices end up in a 4-to-4 deadlock in three separate cases since Justice Scalia's passing--effectively muting the Court's voice in consequential judicial proceedings. President Reagan himself said: ``Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' More recently, retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor put it quite simply, as she always does. She said: ``I think we need somebody there now to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' Indeed, the Supreme Court has granted only three cases since Justice Scalia [[Page S2366]] died--a number experts say is extraordinarily low and an indication that the eight sitting Justices are acutely aware of the precarious position the Court is in with a vacancy. Many Senators apparently believe that President Obama shouldn't be able to make appointments under article II because he is in the last year of his term. The record shows there is nothing in the Constitution that says the President is only President for 3 of the 4 years of his or her term. I don't understand that reasoning. Under that reasoning, any of those same Senators who have made that argument shouldn't be voting on any bill that comes before this body in the last year of their Senate term. If we continue with that rationale, the President's office and the Senate would lead to further dysfunction. Quite honestly, that logic is beyond the pale. It is clear as well that the American people expect us to do our job. Recent polls show that by a 2-to-1 margin Americans want the Senate to hold hearings and vote on Judge Garland's nomination. That is why I remain so perplexed by the logical contortions that many of my colleagues are undertaking to justify their obstruction and quite honestly their failure to do their job. I had the chance to meet with Judge Garland last week. His qualifications and dedication to public service are beyond reproach. He has received strong bipartisan support in the past, but what also stood out to me are his measured view of the role of the judiciary, his strong record on national security, and commitment to keeping our country safe. This past Tuesday marked the 21st anniversary of the bombing of a Federal building in Oklahoma City. On that tragic day in 1995, 168 people, including 19 children, lost their lives. To this day, the Oklahoma City bombing remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in our Nation's history. Judge Garland at that time was Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General. He was the guy who led the criminal investigation and supervised the prosecution of the bombers. Merrick Garland fought for justice for the victims and the families in Oklahoma City. Through his tireless efforts, deep understanding of the law, and attention to detail, he ensured that the prosecution had an airtight case. Ultimately, both bombers were successfully convicted. This is the highest profile instance in which Judge Garland exhibited his commitment to making and keeping our country safe, but it is far from the only one. In my meeting with him, it was clear that the safety and security of our citizens is an issue that quite honestly keeps him up at night. What also stands out about my conversation with Judge Garland is his sense of humility. Our conversation and his judicial record demonstrate to me that he is a moderate, thoughtful, consensus candidate. As Judge Garland said in the Rose Garden on the day he was nominated: People must be confident that a judge's decisions are determined by the law and only the law. For a judge to be worthy of such trust, he or she must be faithful to the Constitution, and to the statutes passed by Congress. He or she must put aside his personal views or preferences and follow the law; not make it. Fidelity to the Constitution and the law has been the cornerstone of my professional life, and is the hallmark of the kind of judge I have tried to be for the past 18 years. These are not the words nor the track record of a judicial activist. In my opinion, this is the kind of judge that Merrick Garland has been: not a judicial activist but someone who recognizes the important role and the important balance between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. I am encouraged that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have at least begun to give Judge Garland the courtesy of a meeting, but meetings alone are not sufficient. The American people deserve the opportunity to hear Judge Garland's qualifications debated in a public hearing in the Judiciary Committee, and they deserve an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. That is all we ask. I again urge my colleagues to give Judge Garland the consideration other nominees have received. At the end of the day, if they choose to vote against him, that is their right, but the idea that somehow they are interpreting the Constitution to say that in the last year of a Presidency a qualified judge should not even receive consideration of a hearing and a vote is quite honestly beyond the pale. Too often these debates end up going on and become extraordinarily complicated. In many ways, what I hear from Virginians--regardless of whether they want me to support Judge Garland--is a very simple message: Do your job. In the coming days and weeks, I hope the Senate will do its job and give Judge Garland the consideration of a hearing before the Judiciary Committee and then take up this eminently qualified jurist's nomination on the floor and give him the vote he deserves. I yield the floor. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Paris Climate Agreement Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to recognize the importance of the signing of the Paris Agreement. Tomorrow marks the 46th anniversary of Earth Day--the first Earth Day--the Earth Day that occurred when I was in seventh grade. My seventh grade teacher made a point of making sure all the students were aware of it. They made sure we had a chance to do a field trip to the community college to learn about some of the issues related to stewardship of the planet. It is a day to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of our blue-green planet but also to recognize, to remind ourselves of the fact that we have a huge responsibility to be good stewards of the wonderful planet we have. It was Theodore Roosevelt who said that ``our greatest central task [is] leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us.'' That is the definition of stewardship, and that is what Earth Day is all about. This is why it is so fitting that tomorrow, on Earth Day, America will join other nations in signing the Paris Agreement. This international climate accord is a tremendous step forward. It makes clear the world recognizes that global warming is a very significant and grave concern facing human civilization on this planet. It is, indeed, the moral challenge of our generation. I am proud and inspired by the global community's unprecedented commitment to avert global warming, to avert a climate crisis. We know what the stakes are. We don't need computer models to look 50 years into the future because the impacts are here today. We see it in our own communities. We see it in our own States. We see it through the impact of droughts, the impact of wildfires, the impact of heat waves, the storms, the hurricanes, the tornadoes. We see it through story after story of this year or this month being the warmest ever recorded by humans. These events have profound costs that can be measured in lost lives, lost homes, lost businesses, billions of dollars in disaster relief. It is important to understand that global warming's major assault is on our rural communities, on our farming, our fishing, and our forestry. You can see it across the world. You can see it across the country. You can see it just inside my home State of Oregon. We have had significant droughts greatly impacting our agricultural community in my State. We have had a loss of snowpack in the Cascades, a trend over decades impacting the availability of water for irrigation in farming. We have seen the impact on fishing, with streams that are warmer and smaller than they were in the past. We have seen it on our oyster population on the coast, where now the oysters are having trouble reproducing because the Pacific Ocean is 30 percent more acidic than it was before we started burning fossil fuels on this planet. That greater acidity is affecting the ability of baby oysters to form shells. That should frighten us all--the ability of shellfish to form shells being threatened. It is hard to imagine that we have burned enough fossil fuels to actually [[Page S2367]] impact the acidity of the oceans. But we have, and the problem is getting worse. We see the impact on our forests. We see it in my home State of Oregon through the red zone. That is the term given to the vast swaths of forests that have been killed by pine beetles because the winters now are not cold enough to kill off the pine beetle. So the infestations are much more aggressive, much more widespread. We see the impact on our forests from more vigorous wildfires and a longer forest fire season--a season that has grown by 60 days over 40 years. That is 2 months. In fact, we have even had forest fires in Oregon in the month of January. It is a huge loss, a huge impact on the ecosystem, and a huge impact on the economy. If you care about rural America and our farming, our fishing, and our forestry, you must care about carbon pollution and global warming. Scientists agree that we must keep the warming of our planet under 2 degrees Celsius in order to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change--impacts much worse than what we are seeing now. But we have already warmed the planet by 1 degree. So we are halfway toward that boundary, which is why an important component of the Paris agreement is not just the substance of the agreement itself but also a compact that the international community will revisit every 5 years, because the measures taken in the Paris agreement are not enough to fend off catastrophe. What they do represent is virtually every nation in the world coming together and saying we understand the challenge to our planet, and we understand that we must be part of the solution. To have more heads of state come together in December for the Paris agreement than at any other time in human history is very impressive. But the commitments made, even if they are fully fulfilled, don't go far enough. We are going to have to come back together every 5 years to add to our understanding and to increase the speed with which we are pivoting from fossil fuels to renewable fuels. At those 5-year gatherings, we will strengthen our pledges, we will work to reduce the emissions even further, and we will review the changing technologies. There is so much investment going on. There is a program called Mission Innovation, which is a number of countries coming together, private companies coming together, and foundations coming together to develop the best ideas--out-of-the-box ideas--to be able to take on the challenge of global warming. Those technologies are going to be a key part of accelerating our ability to tackle this challenge. We have to keep working to drive down the cost curve on renewable energy so that it makes a positive contribution to our economy in every possible way, lowering the cost of power while at the same time putting thousands or, in some technologies, millions of individuals to work. We have to make sure developing countries can afford these options in solar, wind, and other renewable strategies. Together, we must invest in paradigm-shifting technology. One of those might be battery storage, to make better use of solar energy when the solar energy exceeds current demand, or to capture wind energy when the wind is blowing strongly and our wind turbines are producing more than the current demand. It means we have to do things such as investing in a broader grid to ship those amps of electricity around the country--those watts of energy around the country. Here at home, we can't keep up business as usual. If we need to pivot from fossil fuels to renewables, then we shouldn't keep subsidizing fossil fuels. We can't keep drilling oil offshore and opening up drilling in new places like the Arctic. The Arctic nation should come together and reach a pact not to drill in the Arctic and to put it off-limits. As American citizens, you and I own a lot of oil, a lot of coal, and we must recognize that we need to keep those fossil fuels that we own in the ground because here is the size of the problem. For us to succeed in keeping the temperature of our planet below 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial age, we have to leave 80 percent of the identified proven fossil fuel reserves in the world in the ground. If we are going to do that, then it makes no sense at all--for what you and I own as citizens--to be pulling it out of the ground. It makes no sense to be doing contracts today--leases--that provide a legal contract for extraction of our coal, our oil, and our gas, which you and I own as citizens, three decades, four decades, or five decades into the future--long after the world has to have pivoted off of fossil fuels. It is said that when you are in a hole, stop digging. In this case, we are in a carbon pollution hole, and we need to stop digging fossil fuels out of the ground. Instead, we must seize the opportunity to invest in the infrastructure of the future, to spur a clean energy revolution, and to build a green economy creating living-wage jobs. It has been said that we are the first generation to feel the impact of global warming, and we are the last generation that can do something about it. That is a huge responsibility. The signing of this agreement consists of doing something about it, something major about it, something important about it, something that all the Nations in the world have come together to do together to take this on and to recognize our collective responsibility. It is a breakthrough moment in the fight-- the international fight, the human civilization fight--to take on this moral, major challenge to our planet. While this deal is by no means the end of the work we must do, having the global community come together around a vision of action is a huge milestone in the path to averting climate catastrophe. This agreement should only strengthen our Nation's resolve to build a sustainable future, to protect our beautiful blue-green planet, and to work harder to fight climate change not just on Earth Day but every day of the year. In fact, this agreement is very much central to the task that Theodore Roosevelt put before us: to leave our land a better land for our descendants than it is for us. Let's get to work. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3833 to Amendment No. 3801 Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3833. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Minnesota, [Mr. Franken] proposes an amendment numbered 3833 to amendment No. 3801. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To provide funding for the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program) On page 29, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following: Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program For the cost of loan guarantees provided under section 2602(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (25 U.S.C. 3502(c)), $8,500,000, to remain available until expended: Provided, That the cost of those loan guarantees (including the costs of modifying loans, as applicable) shall be determined in accordance with section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 661a): Provided further, That, for necessary administrative expenses to carry out that program, $500,000 is appropriated, to remain available until expended: Provided further, That, of the subsidy amounts provided by section 1425 of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (Public Law 112-10; 125 Stat. 126), for the cost of loan guarantees for renewable energy or efficient end-use energy technologies under section 1703 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16513), $9,000,000 is permanently canceled. Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, Federal programs in Indian Country are chronically underfunded. I have served on the Indian Affairs Committee for the past 7 years, and I have been shocked by what I hear almost every week from tribal leaders about the challenges in Indian Country. Tribes struggle with crumbling schools, dilapidated roads, lack of housing, and lack of basic infrastructure. Many of the crises we hear about in Indian Country come from lack of opportunity, lack of hope. Indian youth have the highest rate of suicide among all ethnic groups in the United States. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for Native youth aged 15 to 24. The Indian suicide rate is 62 percent higher than it is for [[Page S2368]] the general population. Unemployment on Indian reservations averages 19 percent, and on some reservations it is above 50 percent. Senators Murkowski, Heitkamp, and Udall understand the dire needs of Indian Country, which is why they have cosponsored my amendment. Chairman Barrasso also understands the needs of Indian Country, and that is why he also supports this amendment. They understand that we have to support economic development for tribes whenever we can. My amendment sets aside $9 million, which can be leveraged into about $50 to $85 million worth of loans for energy projects in Indian Country. Developing tribal energy resources will help tribes bring power to the most remote parts of Indian Country--improving access to reliable and resilient energy and providing much needed jobs. That is why Congress authorized the loan program in the Energy Policy Act of 2005--to help tribes access the capital they need for energy projects. But this program has never received funding. My amendment doesn't cost anything. We are simply putting $9 million of already-appropriated money toward a new use. I thank Senators Heitkamp, Udall, and Murkowski for cosponsoring my amendment. I thank Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Feinstein for their leadership. Finally, I thank Secretary Moniz, who has been a champion for this program. I urge my colleagues to support Franken amendment No. 3833 to bring jobs to Indian Country. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank Senator Franken for the way he worked with our committee. I will vote for the amendment, and I recommend that others do as well. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3833. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced---yeas 76, nays 19, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 59 Leg.] YEAS---76 Alexander Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Crapo Daines Donnelly Enzi Feinstein Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Kaine King Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill Menendez Merkley Mikulski Moran Murkowski Murray Nelson Peters Reed Reid Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Toomey Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS---19 Ayotte Boozman Cotton Ernst Fischer Johnson Kirk Lankford Lee McConnell Paul Perdue Portman Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Tillis Vitter NOT VOTING---5 Blunt Cruz Durbin Murphy Sanders The amendment (No. 3833) was agreed to. vote explanation Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from this afternoon's vote on Franken amendment No. 3833, which was adopted to the pending business--Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, H.R. 2028. On rollcall vote No. 59, had I been present, I would have voted to support the amendment. Senator Franken's amendment will further strengthen the deployment of clean energy by creating a Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program to fund energy projects in Indian Country. This amendment will help Indian tribes access much needed financing as they seek to develop energy projects and create well-paying jobs. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee to express my appreciation to the majority leader of the Senate, Senator McConnell, and Senator Cochran, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, for moving the process forward. We have on the floor today the Energy and Water Committee bill. This is the first bill of the Appropriations Committee to come to the floor. It signals that we are ready to do regular order. I so appreciate the leaderships' commitment to do that, so we don't end up with a big omnibus bill at the end. Every bill comes, they can be amended, and everyone can have their day and their say. It is an excellent kickoff to what I hope will be the ability to move all 12 bills and some crucial, urgent supplementals. I also compliment Senators Alexander and Senator Feinstein for the excellent job they have done on this particular subcommittee. They have followed the bipartisan agreement. They have a bill that is free of poison pill riders. When you look at what they have done in terms of energy and water, it is an excellent bill from the standpoint of national security and economic development, whether it is the funding for the Army Corps of Engineers that is so important to those of us who have ports, to science in terms of our fields of energy. We win Nobel prizes, but we need to win the markets. It has an excellent approach in terms of tech transfer. Maryland benefits from this bill. It provides over $100 million for the Port of Baltimore. That is going to support the port's nearly 14,000 jobs and a tax base of over $300 million. The Port of Baltimore has always been the gateway to Ohio and the West. First, supported by the B&O--Baltimore and Ohio--Railroad and now CSX. Funding in this bill dredges the port's 50-foot channel, making it ready for megacontainer ships coming through the expanded Panama Canal and supporting the port's competitive edge over its East Coast competition. The bill also funds construction of Poplar Island, where clean dredge material is rebuilding the natural ecosystem of a former Chesapeake Bay island. This bill exceeds the target level for the harbor maintenance trust fund, providing approximately $1.3 billion. Dredging is the primary activity of the trust fund. This funding is knocking out the nationwide backlog of dredging projects, supporting the U.S. economy and local economies. Across Maryland, this bill makes critical investments, protecting Assateague Island, a national seaside treasure, for future generations, protecting Cumberland from flooding, and protecting this area's water supply at the Jennings Randolph Lake in Garrett County. This bill also supports a unique public-private partnership between the U.S. Department of Energy and commercial truck manufacturers. Together, they are developing the next generation of fuel-efficient heavy-duty trucks. Total funding is $20 million. Volvo has been a partner and is competing again for a portion of this funding. Its Hagerstown, MD plant produces Mack Trucks with 1,600 jobs. Their talented professionals have been leaders on truck engine research and development, discovering technologies to reduce oil consumption and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. For the Appalachian Regional Commission, this bill provides $75 million for the base program, an increase of $5 million. The commission meets both physical and human infrastructure needs. This is a hands- across-the-aisle program that all Appalachia Senators support. There are 13 States in the commission. [[Page S2369]] Maryland has three counties in the commission: Washington, Allegany, and Garrett. Maryland's mountain counties receive nearly $5 million annually, making investments to rebound from lost manufacturing jobs. The recession was another setback. Now, through their community colleges, they are retraining and retooling their residents. The commission's grants, matched with local and other Federal funding, are making a big difference. I recently visited Garrett College where I announced two grants. The first was to establish new allied health programs with a simulation manikin. This was a grant award for $110,000. The second grant was to buy Westernport a new water tank. This grant for $400,000 was matched with $2.4 million in other Federal loans and grants. It means more capacity for Westernport, new service to nearby towns of Luke and Bloomington, and a huge cost savings to Luke Mill. The paper mill has been supplying drinking water to the town of Luke. This grant is protecting the 880 employees at Luke Mill and 3,000 regional jobs in timber and trucking. If this is the way it is going to be to move appropriations, I think it is a good day. It is not only a good bill, but it shows when the Senate practices the ability to work together to bring legislation to the floor, to follow regular order, we can get our job done. It can be open, it can be transparent, and we can have amendments. I so look forward to this being the tone and the tempo of the rest of the appropriations season. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas. National Park Week Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, this week I encourage Arkansans and all Americans to take a moment and enjoy your local national parks as we celebrate National Park Week 2016. This year National Park Week is particularly important because it also happens to be the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service, a milestone we will celebrate all year long. For those of you who don't know, our National Park System began in 1872 with the establishment of Yellowstone National Park. The organization charged with managing these parks, the National Park Service, was established four decades later in 1916. Today we have over 400 national parks and historic sites around the country, all full of wildlife, beautiful landscapes, and rich culture. These sites are all cared for by over 20,000 dedicated employees of the National Park Service, including park rangers who patrol our parks and keep visitors safe. Arkansas is home to several national parks and national historic sites, some of the prettiest and most interesting in the country, in my opinion. For those of you who have not been to Arkansas, I encourage you to visit Hot Springs National Park to see our natural springs and thermal pools. If you are a history buff, you can visit Arkansas Post, the site of the only Revolutionary War activity in the State of Arkansas. If you are into the outdoors, you can float the Buffalo River. The list goes on. Each of the national parks and historic sites in Arkansas and around the country has its own unique appeal and holds its own adventure. So happy National Park Week and happy 100th birthday to the National Park Service. I encourage everyone to take advantage of free admission to all national parks in Arkansas and across the country through this Sunday, April 24. Have a little fun, learn a little bit about your great country, and show your support and thanks for the men and women who serve us in the national parks. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to complete this speech. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Corporate Inversions Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, over the past couple of years I have spoken numerous times on corporate inversions, the problems they cause, and various proposed solutions. I wish to take a few minutes today to comment on some of the recent developments with regard to this important issue. Inversions are a matter of great concern in our country. This is true among members of both parties, both in and out of government. As the chairman of the Senate's tax-writing committee, I have to say that for years now, most major discussions I have had on tax policy and reform with various private sector stakeholders eventually end up focusing on inversions. Virtually everyone acknowledges that inversions are a problem. When a U.S. company reidentifies itself as a foreign entity and moves its tax headquarters overseas, it shrinks our tax base. It means lost investment and growth for our country and a further demonstration of the failure of the government to create a tax environment in this country that allows businesses to flourish, create jobs, and, of course, help grow our economy. As I said, members of both parties see inversions as a problem, one that needs fixing. Sadly, the debate surrounding this national issue has too often become mired in politics and partisanship, which thus far has prevented Congress from making any real progress. Some in Washington--in the Capitol and on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue--would rather talk about inversions than solve the problem. When a wave of U.S. companies announce that they are merging with other entities and moving their headquarters offshore, the strategy seems to be to publicly attack those companies; accuse them of, among other things, lacking ``economic patriotism''; and put forward unworkable policy proposals while labelling anyone opposing those proposals as somehow being in favor of or at least indifferent to inversions. Most of the policy ideas that get put forward tend to be punitive and burdensome, with the goal, not of incentivizing companies to stay in the United States, but to forcibly prevent them from leaving. Over the past year or so of political campaigning, we have heard a lot of talk about building walls and who will be made to pay for them. Some are proposing that we build a literal physical wall to keep certain people from coming into the United States, with a supposedly clever plan to force other countries to pay for it. Well, at the same time, most of the proposals we have seen to deal with inversions would amount to building a virtual wall--a wall forged in regulation and punitive tax treatment--around the country to keep companies from leaving and making every business in America and all of their employees and individual customers pay the cost. The latest wall-building exercise came earlier this month with Treasury's temporary anti-inversion regulations and proposed regulations aimed at earnings stripping. Of course, the administration's anti-inversion approach is essentially the regulatory equivalent of a doctor who wastes all of his time and energy treating a patient's symptoms one by one as they arise without making any effort to diagnose, let alone treat, the underlying illness. Inversions are not in and of themselves a disease; they are merely symptoms of a much broader illness that will continue to infect our economy so long as we refuse to treat it. I won't keep you in suspense, Mr. President. That illness is not a lack of proper regulation; it is an overly burdensome tax system and an environment that is, on the whole, unfriendly to American businesses. U.S. companies don't move their tax headquarters offshore because they like the weather in other countries. If that were the case, I don't think so many of them would be moving to Ireland or the U.K. No. American companies invert because they face global competition, and our system forces them to compete on an uneven playing field with at least one, if not both arms tied behind their back. For example, we have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, and we have a tax code that effectively pays U.S. [[Page S2370]] multinationals to keep their foreign earnings offshore and punishes them when they decide to bring capital back into the country. It is these factors--not a lack of appropriate regulation by the government or a shortage of ``economic patriotism'' on the part of American businesses--that make foreign countries more attractive destinations for American companies. If we want to prevent future inversions, we should spend less time tinkering around the regulatory edges and engaging in partisan rhetoric and more time trying to find common ground to actually fix our Tax Code. For the record, it isn't just inversions that are the problem. As I have noted repeatedly, even if the administration and Congress found a way, through punitive and burdensome means, to block all inversions, our tax system would still make American companies even more attractive targets for foreign takeovers, which are every bit as problematic as inversions, if not more so, and much harder to address through a purely regulatory approach. Foreign takeovers are already a problem. According to an Ernst and Young study released last year, the U.S. economy suffered a net loss of $179 billion--with a ``b''--in business and assets to foreign buyers in the decade between 2003 and 2013. The same study also found that a reduced corporate tax rate would have greatly reduced these losses, possibly eliminating them entirely. Keep in mind that unlike most inversion transactions, U.S. management is almost always fired after a foreign takeover. Other employees--local service providers and suppliers--are often targeted for elimination as well. Sadly, many Democrats in Washington, both here in Congress and in the administration, don't seem to grasp the full nature of this problem. They talk a great deal about inversions and the need to prevent them. Because the picture of a big American company moving offshore to escape taxation is particularly distressing for populist audiences, they tend to ramp up that talk and couple it with ideas on how to punish inverters in even-numbered years. Yet they have taken precious little action to fix the underlying problems that lead companies to want to invert in the first place. There was a glimmer of hope with the findings and recommendations of the Finance Committee's bipartisan International Tax Reform Working Group. However, as is far too often the case, that glimmer of hope may very well be overtaken by the politics of the moment. So instead of acknowledging that our tax system is the cause of the inversion problem, my friends on the other side have generally opted to put forward regulations that may very well be effective in curbing inversions in the short term but will do nothing to improve business conditions in the United States and could be in the order of causing companies to sell themselves to foreign buyers, which is what is happening. Within days of the release of the Treasury's latest regulations, Pfizer, a major American drug company, announced it was backing out of its proposed inversion deal with Allergan. Many observers were quick to credit the Obama administration for a supposed job well done while Democratic candidates for President openly celebrated the fact that an American company chose to subject itself to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and penalties in order to avoid even greater losses as a result of these regulations. That is the kind of world we are living in--one where there is a willingness to demonize an iconic American company that employees tens of thousands of American workers and to cheer when it suffers massive losses. That is viewed as an affirmative qualification to be the Democratic nominee for President. Now, to be fair, I will acknowledge that, in addition to unveiling the proposed anti-inversion measures, the Obama administration also laid out a basic framework for corporate tax reform. Of course, this framework, which closely resembles similar proposals the President has included in past budgets, is woefully short on details. It is not a reform proposal with any serious potential for bipartisanship nor one with a detailed list of specific goals and objectives. It is more or less just a vaguely worded wish list of tax ideas they would like to see enacted at some point. The reaction from many sectors of the business community, including from CEOs who more often than not support my friends on the other side, proves the point. We know, basically, that the President's version of international tax reform consists of a one-time mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings to be taxed at a rate designed not to maximize any benefit but to hit a revenue target for increased spending--in other words, so they can spend more money. This would be coupled with a high minimum tax on foreign earnings, also designed specifically for increased spending, not for significantly bringing down the statutory tax rate, which, after all, is one of the few ways you can really help our American companies. Put simply, there is virtually nothing in the President's nebulous tax reform framework that would discourage companies from moving offshore. In fact, one could argue--and many have--that the President's proposed high minimum tax on foreign earnings would actually encourage more U.S. companies to invert. For example, this past November, the vice president of global taxes at Procter & Gamble, another iconic American company, was quoted as saying: ``If we take a step towards a [minimum] tax at the corporate level, we're exacerbating the problem; we're actually guaranteeing that inversions are more attractive.'' On top of these new taxes, there is no real effort in the President's tax framework to improve the business climate in the United States more generally. After all these changes, the framework would still leave the United States with a corporate tax that would be well above the average in the developed world, leaving us right where we have been. In short, this framework is par for the course with this administration. We have heard quite a bit of blame thrown in Congress's direction for not acting to prevent inversions. What we haven't heard is any serious effort on the part of the President or anyone in his administration to engage with Congress on meaningful tax reform. Like I said, the President and his supporters are far more willing to assign blame for the problems caused by our tax system than to actually work toward a solution. This is particularly true in election years, when the motto seems to be this: Why fix a problem when you can blame it on the other side? For my part, I am working to take specific steps to address these problems. I have been the Republican leader on the Senate Committee on Finance for about 4\1/2\ years now, and for 4\1/2\ years I have been calling on my colleagues and imploring officials in the administration to engage on tax reform. To date, I have seen little in the way of a meaningful response. Currently, I am working on a relatively simple but potentially effective tax reform proposal that I believe will be bipartisan and many believe would relieve a great deal of the inversion pressure on American companies and, at the very least, significantly alter the economic calculation for inversion transactions. Best of all, it would do so without punishing companies or imposing burdensome mandates. In short, my proposal would provide more carrots to keep companies from inverting and fewer sticks to punish companies that try to go in that direction. While I am still working with the Joint Committee on Taxation to finalize the details of this proposal, the basic idea behind my proposal would be to streamline the taxation of business income and eliminate instances in which profits and earnings are subject to multiple layers of taxation at the company and shareholder levels. I will have more to say on this proposal in the coming weeks. Today, I am simply trying to counter the narrative that American companies can and should be forced to remain in the United States by regulation. I am trying to demonstrate that you cannot fix the inversion problem by building a virtual wall around the country to keep businesses from leaving, while at the same time keeping tax rates so high that they have to leave to be able to compete. I am trying to show why you can't build that wall expecting some other [[Page S2371]] country to pay for it. Indeed, if an anti-inversion wall goes up without any real changes to improve the tax and business environment in the United States, it will be American workers and consumers that will end up footing the bill. What we are working on is corporate integration. Right now the work we have done seems to be getting some positive feedback from the Joint Taxation Committee, but they are not through with their work yet and so we are going to wait until they are. They should be through by the end of May, or at least that is what they have indicated will be their target. Hopefully, they will have some preliminary results before the end of May. But let me say, if we are right on corporate integration, then both parties should come together to resolve these problems so that we can compete with any company anywhere in the world. I can just say, in short, that this program we are devising will allow the companies themselves to bring down their own tax rates without worrying about what the wonderful Members of Congress are going to do. At the same time, by bringing down those rates, they will be able to help this economy to go forward. So far this has been revenue positive. All we want for this program is to be revenue neutral. But I think we can get there, and I hope my friends on the other side will seriously look at this because this is something we could do this year to help this country resolve its problems with regard to corporate inversions. I believe it will work. I believe it will work. But a lot will depend on the Joint Taxation Committee, and we will see what they are doing. So far the work they have done is positive. They have worked on it for a number of months now. They want to cover every possible ramification, and we are very appreciative of the work they are doing. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I filed two amendments very important to my home State of Florida that I want to discuss. The first is an amendment that would authorize the Central Everglades Planning Project. The Florida Everglades are a national treasure. We have to work together to restore these lands. The State has experienced a wetter-than-average winter. The rains have elevated the levels of Lake Okeechobee which triggered the Army Corps of Engineers to discharge billions of gallons of water to the east through the St. Lucie River and to the west through the Caloosahatchee River. These discharges have been ongoing for months and have negatively impacted the delicate ecosystem in the area as well as the agricultural and tourism industries. In order to diminish these discharges, we must authorize the Central Everglades Planning Project. Once complete, this project will allow water to flow south from Lake Okeechobee to Everglades National Park and to Florida Bay. I had hoped this project would be authorized in 2014 by the administration, but the administration delayed the Army Corps of Engineers' Chief's report, which is the final step before Congress can authorize new projects, but this year we have a real chance to get this done. Thanks to the good work of Chairman Inhofe of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I expect the Central Everglades Planning Project to be included in the forthcoming water bill, which is slated to be marked up in committee next week. I will not ask for a vote on this amendment today, but I want to draw attention to this essential Everglades restoration project. I am hopeful this body can come together to restore our Everglades, but in the meantime I will continue to push for this vital authorization. Mr. President, the other amendment I filed today, cosponsored by Senators Shelby, Nelson, and Sessions, also highlights the importance of water management. The issue at hand there involves water that is naturally supposed to flow south, but it has not done so due to the Army Corps' actions in and around the State of Georgia. The results of this mismanagement have led to a 2013 Department of Commerce fishery disaster. It was declared for oysters in the Apalachicola Bay. During that same year, Senator Nelson and I held a field hearing in Apalachicola, where we heard from local fishermen whose livelihoods and family traditions were injured by the collapse of these fisheries. While we must continue to explore ways to fish more sustainably, a large part of the fisheries' collapse was the lack of freshwater flows. I have long supported the role Governors play in water allocation when the water in question greatly impacts multiple States. However, absent such an agreement between Governors, water continues to be withheld, and the situation has now become dire in my home State of Florida. The bottom line is, the status quo is only working for one State. I, along with the senior Senator from Florida and our colleagues from Alabama, have stood lockstep to bring our respective States to the table to finalize water allocations that will take into account our shared goals. Today we filed an amendment to do just that--to require the Governors to agree on water allocation before the Army Corps of Engineers can reallocate waters between the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin. The amendment also stipulates no funds would be available for reallocation of water within the States if an agreement between the Governors is not finalized. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure. Eureka Gardens Mr. President, on a different matter, I want to take this moment to applaud the residents of Eureka Garden Apartments in Jacksonville, FL, for coming together as a community during a time of hardship. While they face dangerous living conditions and bureaucratic indifference to their concerns, they have remained united and resilient. The bottom line is, the Federal Government has failed them. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has for years certified a living facility that has put hundreds of families at risk. When HUD inspected the property in question last summer, they passed the apartment complex, and they passed it with flying colors. Eureka Gardens received an 85 out of 100, but less than a month later, residents were complaining at tenants' association meetings and to their city council members about how bad their living conditions had become. When my staff visited the complex, what they witnessed was literally unbelievable. They saw crumbling stairs and black mold. They saw exposed electrical wiring that had been covered up by a trash bag. They smelled the natural gas that would soon hospitalize residents just days later. That was and that is unacceptable. My office, along with Mayor Curry of the city of Jacksonville and the city council and the tenants association, pushed for months to have improvements and repairs done to this complex. In February, HUD finally had a date by which all repairs must be completed. When they came back to reinspect Eureka Gardens, it passed the inspection, and they eventually renewed their contract with the property's owner, but the residents continued to say what they have been saying all along--HUD's inspections weren't working. Just recently, HUD revealed that Eureka Gardens passed with a score of 62. The passing score is a 60. However, a senior HUD official admitted that HUD officials do not believe the property would currently pass another inspection. So HUD has just admitted it has certified a failing facility. Something is clearly wrong with the HUD inspection process and Floridians are being hurt because of it. I would like to read part of an article from the Florida Times-Union, which was published on Monday that quotes one of the residents at Eureka Gardens. Dwan Wilson, who said she has had to go to the hospital at least six times with asthma issues since the mold remediation, cried as she spoke about her apartments' problems. [[Page S2372]] ``We thank you all for what you're trying to do,'' Wilson said. ``We thank you all for pushing. But we're telling you they aren't doing anything.'' How many more years must the residents of Eureka Gardens suffer under this mismanagement? How many more children have to be put at risk due to lead poisoning and gas leaks? How many more facilities will HUD continue to rubberstamp approval of only to further sell slumlike conditions for the most vulnerable tenants? How many taxpayer dollars will be wasted by this agency on failing projects such as this? These are the questions HUD must answer. In the meantime, the residents of Eureka Gardens are forced to deal with the consequences of HUD's failures. I will continue to look for solutions to make sure what has happened at Eureka Gardens isn't repeated elsewhere. Americans deserve better from their government. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter I wrote to the Secretary of HUD, and it is dated April 18. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Senate, Washington, DC, April 18, 2016. Hon. Secretary Julian Castro, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, DC. Dear Secretary Castro: For over five months, my office has been involved in the investigation of shocking health and safety conditions at Eureka Garden Apartments (Eureka Garden) in Jacksonville, Florida. It is appalling that American taxpayer dollars have been wastefully spent over the years to fund a facility that has repeatedly put hundreds of people and their families at risk. I am writing to highlight these many problems and to ask for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to conduct a thorough review of its inspection process. As you may know, following reports of code violations at the Westside complex, my Jacksonville staff toured Eureka Garden in early October 2015. They witnessed crumbling stairs disguised with duct-tape and covered with apparent black mold, faulty electric wiring covered with a garbage bag, and a distinguishable natural gas odor being sucked from an outdoor piping system into residents' air-conditioning, among other obvious health and safety issues. HUD confirmed these conditions in an inspection of the property in October 2015, in which physical deficiencies were found in at least 340 of the 400 units. According to HUD's own criteria, almost 50 of those deficiencies represented ``Exigent Health and Safety concerns,'' including mold, water damage, exposed wires, carbon monoxide hazards and leaking gas pipes. Despite these findings, just three months earlier in July 2015, HUD gave Eureka Garden Apartments an 85 out of 100 score in its Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) inspection. Although many of the problems were witnessed during the summer inspection, HUD representatives defended the passing score to my staff in a meeting last October, saying they did not contribute to the assessment of the property as they are not relevant criteria under HUD's inspection process. Had it not been for the residents calling attention to their dire situation, the facility would not have been reviewed again for another two years. Your Department recently notified my office that the most recent inspection of Eureka Garden gave the complex a REAC score of 62 out 100, despite the many repairs that have been completed since the last REAC inspection. This discrepancy indicates something is clearly wrong with the REAC scores. Your Department visited Eureka Garden again on March 17th and 18th and witnessed what my staff and the city of Jacksonville has seen all along--Eureka Garden remains in poor condition. After visiting Eureka Garden most recently, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing wrote in a letter that ``HUD officials do not believe the property would currently pass another REAC inspection.'' However, HUD's protocol has placed enough confidence in the previous inspection that it has renewed GMF's $6 million contract for Eureka Garden. In doing so, HUD has knowingly certified a substandard facility because of a faulty inspection process. Your Department is ultimately responsible as the steward of the taxpayer funding that supports this property. Therefore, to address these concerns, I respectfully request a timely response to the following questions: With conditions at Eureka Garden going unidentified for so long, what does HUD plan to do about reforming its inspection process to identify problems earlier and to ensure passing grades are not given to failing properties? Will HUD explore a broader reform of inspection that expands the role of and resources available for state and local partners to regularly check the status of HUD-certified facilities to ensure greater accountability? Does the Department plan a re-inspection of the complex? During this difficult time, I am proud of the Eureka Garden community for standing up and coming together on behalf of their vulnerable neighbors. This community has demonstrated great strength by collectively voicing their concerns and showing resiliency in the face of bureaucratic indifference and property mismanagement. It is time they are given the respect and quality of life they so deserve after waiting far too long for critical improvements to be made at Eureka Garden. Thank you for your attention to this matter and continued work on this issue. I look forward to your prompt response. Sincerely, Marco Rubio, U.S. Senator. Calling for the Release of Raif Badawi and Waleed Abulkhair Mr. President, one last item I want to discuss today, and I think it is appropriate, given where the President finds himself at this moment in Saudi Arabia. It is regarding a letter I sent earlier this week, along with Senators Durbin, Risch, Leahy, and Johnson to President Obama asking him to raise human rights issues during his meetings in Saudi Arabia--in particular, the case of Raif Badawi and his lawyer Waleed Abulkhair. Raif Badawi is a Saudi blogger. He was arrested in 2012 on the charge of insulting Islam and indicted on several charges, including apostasy. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes. In January of 2015, Raif received his first set of 50 lashes in public. This resulted in an international outcry. Raif's subsequent lashes have been postponed. They have been postponed on health grounds. They have been postponed because just the first 50 lashes were so brutal, there were doubts whether he would survive 50 more, but he continues to serve his sentence in prison. Last week I met with Raif's wife to discuss his case. Raif and his lawyer should be immediately and unconditionally released. While I deeply value and think it is a very important alliance between the United States and Saudi Arabia, this alliance cannot allow our country to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses. I hope we will take up this cause. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record our letter, dated April 19, 2016, that we wrote to the President. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Senate, Washington, DC, April 19, 2016. Hon. Barack Obama, The President, The White House Washington, DC. Dear Mr. President: As you prepare for your upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia, we are writing to express concern regarding the Government of Saudi Arabia's continued treatment of human rights advocates, particularly the documented prosecutions of non-violent activists who are engaging in freedom of expression. Intolerance for freedom of speech and the imposition of travel bans and lengthy prison terms for peaceful dissidents harm Saudi Arabia's reputation internationally and stifle Saudi innovation and creativity. We are concerned that unless you make these issues a priority during your trip, human rights abuses will continue to occur with impunity and the full potential of the U.S.-Saudi relationship will continue to be impeded. Specifically, we request you raise the case of blogger Raif Badawi, who was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes for launching a website that suggested a peaceful discussion about religion. Mr. Badawi endured a first round of 50 lashes in January of 2015 but the remainder of his lashes has been postponed due to his health condition. During his unjust imprisonment, Mr. Badawi has been a recipient of prestigious international awards such as the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. We are also concerned for the case of Mr. Badawi's lawyer, prominent human rights activist Waleed Abu al-Khair, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Additionally, we are concerned about the 2014 travel ban placed on Mr. Badawi's sister Samar Badawi, for her activism defending human rights. In 2012, Ms. Badawi received the U.S. State Department's International Women of Courage Award. In recent months, Ms. Badawi has been called in for questioning by security forces on several occasions and is subject to ongoing harassment. In your meeting with King Salman, we urge you to advocate for the immediate and unconditional release of Raif Badawi and Waleed Abu al-Khair. Additionally, we urge you to request that Ms. Badawi's travel ban be lifted and ensure that she is not harassed further for her work. This is an important time for Saudi Arabia to play a leadership role in the region and the world by setting an example of religious tolerance and civility. We value the United States and Saudi Arabia close partnership and support efforts to [[Page S2373]] find common approaches to addressing such critical issues as combating terrorism. However, true partners need to be able to have a frank dialogue about disagreements and areas of concern in our relationship. It is thus essential that the United States does not turn a blind eye to Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses. Sincerely, Marco Rubio. James E. Risch. Ron Johnson. Richard J. Durbin. Patrick Leahy. Mr. RUBIO. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Energy Policy Modernization Bill Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the bipartisan Energy Policy Modernization Act, which passed the Senate yesterday with my strong support. This bill will help improve the energy efficiency of our buildings and appliances, saving Michiganders money on their heating and electric bills by incentivizing weatherization and other activities. Many of these cutting-edge building efficiency technologies, such as insulation and window sealing, are designed and developed in my great State of Michigan. The bill also included a number of conservation provisions that will not only protect our environment, but they will boost our economy by supporting the $646 billion outdoor recreation industry. Permanent authorizations of the Land and Water Conservation Fund and reauthorization of the North American Wetland Conservation Act are just two examples that will protect wildlife habitat and improve access to public lands for all kinds of outdoor recreation. Mr. President, I would also like to take a moment to focus on a bipartisan provision that I authored with my colleagues Senator Stabenow and Senator Alexander, the Vehicle Innovation Act. This legislation will provide the tools that researchers, engineers, manufacturers, and others need to create the next generation of cars and trucks built in Michigan and in States all across our country. Southeast Michigan is home to more engineers per capita than anywhere else in the country. We must ensure that our automakers, part suppliers, and other advanced manufacturers have the right tools to develop and incorporate new vehicle innovations that will improve safety, innovation, and vehicle performance in the cars and trucks of the future. Exciting innovations are already underway. Cars and trucks are being made with high-strength, light-weight materials that can improve fuel economy without compromising safety. Improved combustion technologies can increase the efficiency of traditional engines while decreasing emissions. Researchers are making batteries more affordable and recyclable while enhancing battery range and performance, making hybrids and electric vehicles even more competitive. The Department of Energy's Vehicle Technologies Program is leading this effort, working with a wide range of partners, manufacturers, material suppliers, universities, energy suppliers, and our National Laboratories. The Department of Energy's vehicle technology activities are authorized by a patchwork of different laws, and these authorities were last renewed almost a decade ago. A lot has changed in that time. Vehicles today are wired with cutting-edge electronics and sensors. While my favorite part of Detroit cars and trucks remains horsepower and torque, advances in onboard computers and new technologies are making our cars safer, more efficient, and more competitive globally. The Peters-Alexander-Stabenow Vehicle Innovation Act provides for a steady increase in funding for critical DOE programs through the year 2020. This will create more certainty for companies and entrepreneurs engaged in public-private partnerships and ensure that critical research and development can keep up as technologies continue to emerge. Our bill also establishes a clean authorization for DOE's advanced vehicle technology activities. This will improve collaboration with light-duty automobile and medium- and heavy-duty commercial truck engineers, manufacturers, and suppliers to conduct cutting-edge technology-neutral research that will improve fuel economy and minimize fossil fuel use. With over 256 million vehicles on our roads, it takes decades of sustained effort to turn over our fleet. It is absolutely critical that we continue developing these advanced technologies here in the United States in order to achieve major fuel savings in the future and become truly energy independent. The Vehicle Innovation Act has support from major manufacturers, labor, and environmental groups. This is something that just makes sense. I appreciate the support of Senators Murkowski and Cantwell and all my colleagues who supported including this legislation in the bipartisan energy package. While I was pleased to see this commonsense measure included, I continue to be frustrated and disappointed that this body has held up an up-or-down vote on a bipartisan package authored by Senator Stabenow and me to help the people of Flint, MI. Flint is still in crisis mode as families still do not have safe, reliable water flowing from their taps. Senator Stabenow and I will continue pursuing all paths to fight for the assistance that the people of Flint deserve. We will not give up. We remain fully committed to delivering to Flint families the assistance they need to be able to use their tap water for bathing, cooking, and drinking without the fear that it may harm them or their children. I know that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are willing and able to join us in our efforts to help Flint. I urge them to continue working with us to pass this package through the Senate as soon as possible. The people of Flint cannot wait any longer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Judiciary Committee Investigations Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to take this time to respond to Senator Reid's juvenile attacks on my Judiciary Committee's investigations and to Senator Reid's frequent crying about my previous State Department holds. Over the past several months, Senator Reid has been obsessed with mentioning holds on nominees--holds which I no longer have. Holds are often necessary to force the executive branch to comply with congressional investigations. If you want proof of that, just ask the Obama administration. In a Federal court filing during the Fast and Furious litigation, the Obama administration argued that the court should not even consider that particular case. The Justice Department's brief said courts should not enforce subpoenas at all. Instead, the Justice Department reasoned that Congress should use other powers to get documents. Here is exactly what the government brief said: ``Among other powers, Congress can withhold funds from the Executive Branch, override vetoes, decline to enact legislation, refuse to act on nominations, and adjourn.'' Later in the brief, the Obama administration specifically suggested that Congress can ``tie up nominations'' in order to get documents. If the administration can say that, why would Senator Reid think that is a wrong act for Congress to take? It is this simple: If the minority leader doesn't like Senators using holds to get documents from agencies, perhaps Senator Reid should talk to his friends in the Obama administration who suggested that in the first place. In addition, Senator Reid shows his hypocrisy since Members on his own side have held up Obama nominees, and Senator Reid never said a peep about Democrats exercising their rights. Further, Senator Reid's attempts to politicize the Judiciary Committee's oversight work are very uninformed and result in misguided statements, and Senator Reid's accusation that taxpayer money is being wasted by engaging in oversight of the executive branch rings hollow. Secretary Clinton's nongovernment server and private email arrangements effectively walled off her official communications from the normal Freedom [[Page S2374]] of Information Act and other Federal recordkeeping requirements. So to Senator Reid, I say: The Freedom of Information Act is squarely within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee and subject to oversight. The former Secretary's use of a secret, private server to conduct all of her official business led to an avalanche of Freedom of Information Act litigation. It also caused inaccurate responses to Freedom of Information Act requests. For example, in December 2012, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for records of Secretary Clinton's email addresses. The Department responded by stating: ``No records responsive to your request were located.'' That response is very misleading, at best. Senior Department officials knew about Secretary Clinton's use of private email for official correspondence since they were sending emails to her nongovernment email address. They would have known instantly of records responsive to that request that the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington submitted. Yet those senior officials apparently failed to communicate with the State Department's Freedom of Information Act office. Even then, if State's FOIA office were to search Secretary Clinton's government email account, they would find nothing since she operated a private account not subject to freedom of information. Separate from her email address, Secretary Clinton's nongovernment server was a secret to high-level officials at the State Department who were responsible for information technology and security. These officials had no idea the Secretary was operating a separate unofficial system. She did not get their approval to do so, so how would they know? The Judiciary Committee has interviewed the Chief Information Officer, the former Chief Information Officer, the former Deputy Chief Information Officer, and the Director of Diplomatic Security at the State Department. The Chief Information Officers oversaw the work of the information technology staffer who Secretary Clinton secretly paid to maintain her nonpublic server, yet all of these people knew nothing about that nonpublic server. That staffer didn't ask permission to have outside employment. While working at the State Department, he didn't disclose his outside income on his financial disclosure forms. Now, think about that. Officials whose job it is to know were kept in the dark about this ``home brew'' email server. If a government agency hopes to be transparent with the American people--and that is the point behind the Freedom of Information Act legislation--it must first be transparent with itself. Now we know that highly classified material was transmitted to and stored on Secretary Clinton's secret server. What is important about that is this is an issue of national security. State Department diplomatic security personnel have informed the Judiciary Committee that they were unaware of Secretary Clinton's using a nongovernment server for official business. So how, then, could they possibly secure it from security threats? Now, the FBI is investigating this matter as well as several other investigations. We keep hearing that the FBI's inquiry is just a security review and not a criminal inquiry. So let me tackle that. However, one witness asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination rather than answer questions about his work on Secretary Clinton's secret server. And he is relying on the Fifth Amendment to withhold his personal emails as well. Recently, the Department of Justice granted him immunity. So, quite naturally, we are searching for other ways to get information before deciding whether it might be appropriate to seek an immunity order for his testimony. Now, to Senator Reid: These are legitimate oversight inquiries for the Judiciary Committee. Further, Secretary Clinton did not turn over all of her official emails. Emails between GEN David Petraeus and Secretary Clinton, which Secretary Clinton failed to provide to the State Department, were later turned over to the Defense Department. Secretary Clinton also failed to turn over emails with Sydney Blumenthal, whom Secretary Clinton views as an off-the-books intelligence resource, while Secretary of State. If Secretary Clinton had used a government email address for official emails, we wouldn't have this problem in the first place. So how many more official emails were not turned over but should have been? The Judiciary Committee cannot ignore these important issues simply because the former Secretary decided to run for President. And to be perfectly clear, I started this investigation before Secretary Clinton announced her candidacy. Senator Reid suggested that the committee's work on these issues is a waste of money. Senator Reid, that is nonsense. Congressional oversight is not a waste of money; it is a constitutional responsibility. The minority leader fails to understand that Congress is obligated to oversee that the executive branch of government faithfully executes the laws and faithfully spends the money the way Congress intended. Without such constitutional oversight, Congress will not know if there are failures in the executive branch's duty to faithfully execute the laws that we pass. But do my colleagues know what is a real waste of money? This administration fought tooth and nail in the courts against Congress for more than 4 years. Why? Just to avoid disclosing documents in the Fast and Furious scandal that they eventually turned over. That is a waste of money--a 4-year waste of money. The Obama administration has fought against the press and watchdog organizations for years in the Freedom of Information Act litigation over former Secretary Clinton's email records. Senator Reid, that is a waste of money. It is shocking that the Obama Justice Department devotes so much taxpayer resources to avoiding the very transparency that President Obama promised on January 21, 2009--1 day into office. This administration was going to be the most transparent in the history of the entire country, and it has turned out to be the most stonewalling. None of that would be necessary if the administration would just comply with congressional subpoenas and the Freedom of Information Act. That is the way to save money. By the way, I would like to ask how much taxpayers' money does Senator Reid spend having his staff write daily speeches trying to undermine the work of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Reid also fails to understand that we are not only focused on Secretary Clinton. The committee is conducting dozens of investigations on a broad range of issues under the jurisdiction of the committee. Some of the executive branch agencies have complained about the amount of oversight work the committee does on other matters. To justify my statements for this part of my remarks, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two letters. The first is from the Department of Homeland Security, and the second is from the Department of Justice. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC, November 18, 2015. Hon. Charles E. Grassley, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Grassley: Since I became Secretary of Homeland Secretary almost two years ago, I have worked to make the Department more responsive to congressional correspondence, directives, request for reports, briefings and hearings, and other requests for documents and information. Given that some 108 committees and subcommittees of Congress (depending on how you count) assert oversight jurisdiction over this Department, this is a full-time, time consuming task. We have also participated in about 100 hearings and over 2000 non-hearing engagements with Congressional members and staff since the beginning of the 114th Congress. Members on both sides of the aisle have acknowledged our increased responsiveness. So far in 2015, I have received 46 letters from you alone-- almost one per week. I know because I read them all. Many of these letters request reams of information, data, and documents that take hundreds of hours and dozens of staff to compile. We work diligently to respond to your letters promptly, but there is a huge cost to this. [[Page S2375]] Senator, I ask for your help in focusing and prioritizing these oversight letters. I want to continue to be responsive to your requests, and I want to do so as quickly as possible. At the same time, I must ensure that my staff remains focused on all our other priorities. I welcome the opportunity to discuss with you. Sincerely, Jeh Charles Johnson. ____ U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legislative Affairs, Washington, DC, September 18, 2015. Hon. Charles E. Grassley, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: This responds to your letters to the Attorney General, dated June 12, 2015, July 10, 2015, August 13, 2015, September 14, 2015, and September 15, 2015, regarding the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The Department of Justice (the Department) has provided responses in our letters of August 14, 2015, August 25, 2015, and September 11, 2015. As noted in those letters and discussed with your staff, we continue to collect and review information, including the information noted in your letters, so we may provide a complete and thorough response to all of your inquiries as expeditiously as possible. We will continue to keep an open line of communication with your staff as we work toward additional responses to your questions. The Department takes these issues seriously, and we thank you for bringing them to our attention. As you know, this year the Department has received from your office almost 100 letters containing more than 825 questions and document requests, including the five letters received to date on this matter. While we have made and will continue to make all reasonable efforts to meet your stated deadlines, our ability to respond in a timely manner to your inquiries is impacted by the significant volume of letters we receive. We hope this information is helpful. Please do not hesitate to contact this office if we may provide additional assistance regarding this or any other matter. Sincerely, Peter J. Kadzik, Assistant Attorney General. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, both of the letters note the many dozen letters and hundreds of requests that I have sent, and both essentially complain about the volume of our investigation and requests for information. The Judiciary Committee is hard at work doing the people's business, and the committee is doing much more than just oversight. The committee has reported 16 executive nominees and 37 judicial nominees. It has processed 27 bipartisan bills out of committee, and every bill that has come out of committee is a bipartisan bill. Eighteen of those bills were passed out of the Senate over to the House, eight of which have been signed into law by the President. Just last week, the committee unanimously adopted bipartisan legislation to finally protect FBI whistleblowers who report wrongdoing to their supervisors and provide for independent review of FBI whistleblower cases for the first time. So reviewing that record, it seems to me we can ask Senator Reid to justify his claim that this committee is partisan. The committee concluded an investigation into the abuse and misuse of paid administrative leave. The committee took the results and worked hard with Members on both sides of the aisle to actually fix that problem. In February, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee approved the bipartisan, commonsense reforms in the Administrative Leave Act of 2016. Similarly, the committee has worked with Democrats and Republicans alike to overturn an Office of Legal Counsel opinion that allows the agencies across government to stonewall their inspectors general. Now let me tell my colleagues how Senator Reid is involved in stonewalling that effort. We came up with a legislative solution called the IG Empowerment Act and attempted to pass it in December by a live unanimous consent request. But Senator Reid objected to the bill even though it is supported by seven Members of his own caucus and supported by the New York Times editorial board and a host of civil liberties and good-government groups. Even the largest circulating daily newspaper in the home State of Senator Reid urged him to work with us on a compromise. But rather than engaging us in a productive and civil manner, Senator Reid publicly slandered the bill as a legislative overreach. He claimed that he was concerned about a provision that allowed inspectors general to issue testimonial subpoenas to fight waste, fraud, and abuse. In fact, Senator Reid voted--Senator Reid actually voted--to give the exact same authority to the Office of Special Counsel in 1989. That 1989 bill passed the Senate unanimously and is now law. Senator Reid, was that legislative overreach when you did it? Like that bill, the IG Empowerment Act has near unanimous support and is designed to root out wrongdoing from government, while ensuring proper safeguards of the use of subpoenas. So there is no reason to object to this bill on policy grounds. Yet Senator Reid stands in the way of getting that done. The Judiciary Committee will continue its work. I say that to just one Senator: Senator Reid. And during the course of my oversight work, I will use every tool at my disposal to obtain answers for the American people. So, Senator Reid, I will keep faith with my oath of office and ``we the people.'' I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Oklahoma City Bombing Anniversary and Nomination of Merrick Garland Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, 21 years ago this week, the families of 168 people--19 of those 168 people children--received some of the worst news of their lives. That news was that a beloved member of each of their families had been killed in the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City. We all watched the news that day, that night, the next day, and that week and beyond, as we took in the devastation caused by that blast. That horrible crime was carried out by a radical, anti-government extremist. It remains the deadliest act of homegrown terrorism in our Nation's history. For the families who lost a loved one that day in 1995, there is no way to fill the void left by a life taken too soon, but I know that our government's pursuit of justice for the lives lost that day serve as a small source of comfort for the people who were left in mourning. At the time of that heinous crime, Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, was the Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice. He immediately flew to Oklahoma City to lead the criminal investigation and supervise the prosecution of the bombers. In fact, he insisted on being sent. He didn't just volunteer. He didn't just say: Well, OK, I will go. He told his supervisors they had to let him go. He was the highest ranking Justice Department official on the ground in Oklahoma City following the bombing. He helped oversee every aspect of the investigation and the subsequent trial. His colleagues at the time have attested to Judge Garland's commitment to following the letter of the law in every aspect of that investigation. He refused to take any shortcuts that could somehow compromise the integrity of the case that he and his team were building. Through their tireless efforts, his tireless leadership, his deep understanding of the law, and scrupulous attention to detail, Judge Garland ensured the prosecution had an airtight case. Ultimately, both bombers were convicted, giving the families of the 168 victims not their sons, their daughters, their children, their moms or dads back again, but at least providing a small measure of vindication for the losses they had incurred. Judge Garland's work was so appreciated by the families and friends of those victims 21 years ago that last year, on the 20th anniversary of the bombing, the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum awarded Judge Garland its annual Reflections of Hope distinction--not the year after the bombing but 20 years after the bombing. Judge Garland has established an unparalleled reputation as a brilliant, dedicated prosecutor and jurist. He has received strong bipartisan support in the legal community, including from Alberto Gonzales, the former U.S. Attorney General and White House Counsel in the administration of President George W. Bush. So today it is not just discouraging that most of my Republican colleagues are refusing to consider Judge Garland's nomination to serve on our highest Court; personally, I believe it is outrageous. [[Page S2376]] I served for 8 years as Governor of Delaware, a State that is renowned for its own courts--supreme court, court of chancery, superior court--courts that play a national role, not just on a State level. As Governor of my State for 8 years, I nominated men and women to serve on those courts. In every one of those nominations there were hearings held, whether they were Democrat or Republican. I think during that period of time I nominated an equal number of Democrats and Republicans to the judiciary. That is the constitution of our State, and, frankly, that is a great example because in Delaware we have one of the highest regarded judiciaries. My obligation as Governor was to nominate outstanding candidates for these judgeships as they became vacant. The role of the State Senate in Delaware was to consider them. They never waited a year and left a seat vacant for a year awaiting the end of my time as Governor or any other Governor's time. That would never happen. We wouldn't waste 10 months. State senators in our State wouldn't wait 10 weeks. They did their jobs. They did their jobs. We are not doing ours, and we need to. The fact that we haven't is outrageous. When we elect Presidents to this country, we elect them for 4 years, and if they are reelected, then it is for another 4 years. They are not Presidents for 3 years and 11 months; they are not elected to a term of 3 years and 10 months. We elect them to a term of 4 years. They need to be on the job for 4 years. Our President is doing what he is supposed to do, and that is sending us the names of exceptional people who serve in incredibly important positions like the Supreme Court. He has done his job. I very much want to do mine, and I want to be joined by Democrats and Republicans in doing our jobs. Every Member of this body has taken at least one oath to uphold the Constitution--some of us, many times over. At 17 years old, not much older than the young interns who are sitting here in the Chamber, I took my first oath as a midshipman. I was a freshman at the Ohio State Navy ROTC, where I was privileged to go on a Navy scholarship. Four years later, I took another oath and raised my right hand as an ensign in the Navy. I took an oath to defend the Constitution and the country and headed to Pensacola, FL, to become a naval flight officer right in the middle of the Vietnam war. I ended up serving three tours over there during that conflict. As a Congressman, I took an oath to defend the country and Constitution. As Governor, I also took a similar oath to defend our country's Constitution--at least to defend our State's constitution. Then, as a U.S. Senator I have taken an oath any number of times. I am regarded by my colleagues as one of the least partisan people here, but I think the refusal of the majority to even consider this nomination is more than an abdication of our responsibility. I believe it is an example of playing politics with the very Constitution we have sworn to uphold. For those who don't know, Delaware is known as the First State. We are known as the First State because on December 7, 1787, before any other State had ratified the Constitution, we did. I joke with people that for 1 week Delaware was the entire United States of America. We opened things up and let in Maryland; we let in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and eventually Louisiana--even Iowa. I think for the most part it has turned out pretty well, but the idea of playing politics with the Constitution that we have sworn to uphold is deeply troubling to me. I hope that is not what is going on here, but I fear that it is. The right and just way to proceed is to begin consideration of Judge Garland's nomination, not next month and not some other year, but now-- first in committee and then on the Senate floor. We have something we call the Delaware way. We are focused on the three C's--communicate, compromise, and collaborate. That is a good example for 49 other States, and I think it is a good example right here. After all, we have been sent by the people to this hallowed place, this Senate Chamber, to put democracy into action, to protect liberty and to protect justice for all. Nearly 50 years ago, former Chief Justice Warren Burger, a conservative--I believe he was from California and was appointed or nominated by Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican. Former Chief Justice Warren Burger said, ``A sense of confidence in the courts is essential to maintain the fabric of ordered liberty for a free people.'' He went on to say that ``inefficiency and delay will drain even a just judgment of its value.'' I think the shorthand version of that is justice delayed is justice denied. Justice delayed is justice denied. By dragging our feet and trying to get into a new Congress, maybe with a new President--certainly, with a new President--that is delaying justice, I believe. In the face of the prospect of any number of potentially 4-to-4 divided verdicts in the Supreme Court with only eight members, we cannot just stand aside and let that happen. Justice Burger was right when he said those words all those years ago, and he is right today. Mr. President, I think it is time to stop this delay. It is time for us to serve the people. It is time for us to deliver justice. It is time for us to give this President's nominee the consideration demanded of us by the Constitution, which we are sworn to uphold. Mr. President, I see no colleague seeking recognition, and with that I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Prince Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to speak of the loss of the one of Minnesota's own, and that is Prince. Like all Minnesotans, today we were shocked and saddened. I grew up with Prince's music, starting with ``Little Red Corvette'' in the seventies and eighties. We won't forget ``Purple Rain'' in Minnesota. We were so proud of that movie, and everyone would point at every spot in the movie they knew from growing up. He was a superstar, composer, amazing performer, and a music innovator with a fierce belief in the independence of his art. He lived his art. He believed his words were his own, his name was his own, and he wasn't going to let anyone own him. There was absolutely nobody like him, and there never will be. Prince sold more than 100 million records worldwide. He released 39 studio albums. He had five No. 1 Billboard hits and 40 in the top 100. He won seven Grammys, an Oscar, and a Golden Globe. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the first year he was eligible. But even with all that success, even with all that fame, Minnesota never lost that sense that he was a beloved son--our neighbor, the superstar next door. I was always so proud to say: ``Prince--you know he's from Minnesota.'' He was born there, and he still lives there. The fact that Prince was a proud native of my State came through in all of his music. He pioneered the Minneapolis sound--that mixture of funk, rock, and pop that emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s and influenced music for decades to come. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Janet Jackson, Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson, Justin Timberlake, The Weeknd, Beyonce--these are just some of the many artists who were influenced by that sound. But that sound didn't just influence artists, it influenced everyone who heard it. Prince's music touched our hearts, opened our minds, and made us want to dance. That is his legacy, and that is what we will always remember. Prince made ``Purple Rain'' a household name. Like most Minnesotans, I remember the first time I listened to that album. It was, as his band was then called, a revolution. It changed music forever and is considered among the best in music history. Two of the songs on that album--``When Doves Cry,'' which is especially notable because he plays all of the instruments in the song, and ``Let's Go Crazy''--rose to the top of the charts. [[Page S2377]] ``Let's Go Crazy'' includes a lesson important to remember on days like today. There is a world waiting for us after this life, Prince sang, ``a world of never ending happiness, where you can always see the sun, day or night.'' I know that today all of us hope Prince is standing in that Sun. Prince sang that song at First Avenue--the venue in downtown Minneapolis--when he introduced his band to the city in 1983. There, too, Prince shot some of the scenes for his classic ``Purple Rain'' film. Today the club is a landmark and a must-play venue for some of the best artists. I personally stood in Prince's dressing room surrounded by pictures of him. The building is covered in stars with the names of artists who have performed there, and there will always be one star that will shine the brightest, and that is the man who made it the landmark it is--Prince. Minnesota loves Prince, and Prince loved Minnesota. He was born in Minneapolis. He went to Central High School, where he played piano and guitar for a band called Grand Central. He recorded his early demo tapes with Chris Moon and at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis. Throughout his life, he called Minnesota home. He wrote a song about the Minnesota Vikings--he was always a big fan--appropriately titled ``Purple and Gold.'' At the end of last year when the Minnesota Lynx--our women's basketball team--won the WNBA championship, he held a concert at his recording studio, Paisley Park, for local fans, who got to enjoy his music well into the night. Just a few days ago, he hosted a dance party there and made a brief appearance. In some way, it was his last gift to our State. But his best and lasting gift? His music, his innovation, his energy. When accepting BET's Lifetime Achievement Award, Prince said: The future's in your hands now. And the world really is yours. Well, that world is a whole lot cooler because Prince was in it, and it is a whole lot sadder today now that he is gone. My heart goes out to his friends and family and to all who mourn his loss today. We will miss the artist Prince. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Paris Climate Agreement Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am on the floor I guess just a few moments ahead of the ranking member of our Senate Foreign Relations Committee, my friend Ben Cardin, who is on his way but has authorized me to proceed with a few remarks on the topic that he and I, and perhaps others, would like to address, which is tomorrow's signing in New York of the Paris climate agreement. Over 160 nations around the world are going to be participating in signing that agreement that will move many of them immediately into their program of compliance and signify for others a statement of intention to join. I think it is the largest international agreement, in terms of the number of countries involved, ever, certainly the biggest one I can think of. So it is very significant in that respect. One other thing about Paris that I think was also very significant is what took place in America's corporate sector in support of a strong Paris Agreement. The President and groups like Ceres, with particular leadership from companies like Unilever, got together and created a remarkable American corporate coalition with more than 150 companies, including ones like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, Ford and GM, Nike, and VF industries, General Mills, Cargill, Apple, Google--a terrific coalition; kind of the who's who of corporate America. They got together to urge the countries of the world to be bold in Paris, to have it be a strong agreement, and to show their support for an international program to address climate change, which I think is terrific. The distinguished junior Senator from Louisiana is presiding, and I can't think off the top of my head what Louisiana-based companies are part of that coalition, but certainly companies that are based in virtually every State we represent in the Senate--major companies: Walmart, for instance, out of Arkansas; Coca-Cola, out of Georgia; VF industries, out of North Carolina; some of our biggest electric utilities; the bulk of the property casualty insurance and reinsurance industry. It is very significant that America's corporate community came so strongly together. I hope very much that is a message that not only resonated in Paris but that will resonate in Congress as well because I would bet that every single one of us have a significant home State corporation that has signed that pledge, and some of us will have many significant home State corporations that will have signed that pledge. So when you have gotten to the point where the leadership of America's corporate community has signed on to the fact that something needs to be done and that America ought to lead--that is our role in the world--that will begin more and more to have an effect in this body to counter some of the nonsense and mischief that a very small slice in the fossil fuel industry has been propagating at the expense of the broader American corporate community, which, by and large, has been pretty outstanding on this. Let me also mention one other thing that has happened just this afternoon, which I am very encouraged by; that is, an amendment that has been filed by 10 Senators--bipartisan, 5 and 5. It is the Graham- Whitehouse amendment. The cosponsors on the Republican side are Senators Graham, Kirk, Ayotte, Collins, and Portman. On the Democratic side, they are Whitehouse, Merkley, Schatz, Markey, and Brown. The amendment reads: Climate change is real, and human activity contributes to climate change. Climate change is already affecting the American people and poses an increasing risk to our health, security, economy, and infrastructure. Over 180 nations, including China, India, and Brazil, have made commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, creating opportunities for American workers and innovative private industry benefits from global clean energy markets. Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that the United States should be a world leader in addressing climate change; that Congress is best positioned to address policies that leave a prosperous economy and healthy environment for future generations; that Congress has a responsibility to take actions that reduce emissions and combat climate change; and, finally, that Congress should support research and development to bolster clean energy technology. In that latter regard, let me note the Mission Innovation Initiative that has come out of Secretary Moniz's Department of Energy and out of a significant group of major investors around the world. The deal basically is that countries involved will try to double our clean energy R&D, and in return these major investors from around the world, led by Bill Gates, will set up a significant fund that will take the emerging technologies that early R&D can discover and bring them through the various early investment stages of what investors and startup folks call the valleys of death on the way to becoming a sustainable company so those technologies can be brought forward on an accelerated basis. So when you look at Paris, you not only see this enormous array of nations coming together in a common cause, you see right behind it virtually the entirety of the leadership of America's corporate sector coming right in with it and saying: This is what we want. This is what we encourage. We want it to be strong. You have the biggest investors in the world, most of them coming together and saying: We are going to have your back with investment into new types of clean energy funding. And then you have the governments of the world not only signing up for--not all of them but the ones participating in Mission Innovation-- signing up, in addition to the treaty, for this commitment to increase R&D and press innovation in this space forward. So for all those reasons and more, tomorrow is a good news day for our country. It is a good news day for [[Page S2378]] progress and innovation, it is a good news day for the enormous array of American corporate leaders who have supported and cheered on this particular occasion, and I think it is an occasion for pride on the part of the United States of America that the signing will be taking place in the United States in New York, that Secretary Kerry will be attending, that the Chinese leader will be attending, and that people from all around the world will be there not only recognizing the need to do this but recognizing America's leadership in getting us to this place. I will close with a personal note of appreciation for a gentleman named Todd Stern. Todd was the climate negotiator for the Department of State for many years, and some of those were rather bleak years in which the United States was not showing leadership. So Todd had to hang in there and endure that frustration and keep his candle of faith burning until the day came when we finally began to kick in at last. His role was very important in getting us prepared for and through the Paris Agreement. He is retiring and has served his country well. So I will close with a word of good will for that particular public servant who has done right by his duty and done right by his country. With that, I yield the floor, and with any luck, we can await the arrival of Senator Cardin in due course. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Prince Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks today regarding climate change, I wish to say a few words about a Minnesota icon who passed away today. Prince was a phenomenal artist who was beloved by people all over the world, but as Minnesotans, we are particularly proud to call him one of our own. Prince got his start in a Minneapolis jazz band and went on to share his talent throughout Minnesota and all over the globe. His artistry, his innovation, and his unparalleled presence inspired and will continue to inspire millions of people. In Minneapolis, he put one of our most cherished venues, First Avenue, on the map. Up until just a few days ago, he was still performing, having held a concert in Atlanta. He is truly going to be missed. Someone once said: A brain isn't a mind, and a mind isn't a soul, and that is why we need the artists. I think the outpouring of appreciation we are seeing today for Prince has to do with that unique role artists play, and it speaks to the importance of the arts and to human beings. Paris Climate Agreement Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in celebrating the official signing of the Paris climate agreement. Tomorrow, more than 160 countries will send representatives to New York to sign onto this historic agreement. This gathering is set to become the most well-attended signing event in the history of the United Nations--highlighting the importance of this issue for people around the entire world. I think it is very fitting that this event is taking place on Earth Day. This agreement has been nearly 25 years in the making. International climate efforts date back to 1992, when governments met in Rio with the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations. Nations have met every year since then to further this goal. While some meetings have been more successful than others, most have been met with disappointment and lack of action. After all, climate change is a complex issue, and achieving consensus for any international issue is no small fete, which is why this agreement is truly, truly impressive. Last December, I traveled to Paris with nine of my colleagues. We met with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, with U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, and with our then top climate change negotiator Todd Stern. I would like to congratulate all of them for their stellar work. I would also like to thank Todd Stern for his service at the State Department and his dedication to combating climate change. Mr. Stern played a critical role in achieving a successful resolution in Paris, and I have no doubt that his successor, Dr. Jonathan Pershing, will effectively continue his work. Climate change is an existential threat to our planet and to future generations. My colleagues have been on the floor of the Senate today to talk about the impacts of climate change on their States and the need to address it. So I wish to take a minute to talk about how it is going to impact Minnesota. Minnesota is one of the top producing agricultural States in the country, where one out of five jobs is tied to agriculture. Climate change will have significant impact on our food system, both through warmer temperatures and more intense droughts. A recent study estimates that global crop production could decrease by more than 40 percent by the end of the century. That is why I joined Dave MacLennan, the CEO of Cargill--the largest privately owned company in the country--in penning an op-ed in the Minneapolis StarTribune to highlight this threat, especially considering that the global population will reach 9 billion by midcentury. As the CEO of a company focused on agriculture, David is concerned about what climate change is going to do to our food supply. Climate change will also impact our waters. Minnesota is the Land of 10,000 Lakes. Actually, it is about 14,000 lakes, including Lake Superior, which contains about 10 percent of the world's fresh surface water. Lake Superior has about 10 percent of the fresh surface water on Earth. Lake Superior is warming by 2 degrees per decade. We are seeing more evaporation and lower water levels in the lake. Plus, rising temperatures allow for more favorable conditions for invasive species and hazardous algal blooms. Warmer temperatures could also have severe consequences to fish like walleye and trout, which are so important to Minnesota fisheries and to our ecosystems. Let's not forget the threat of climate change to our forests. Like our lakes, warmer temperatures elevate the threat of invasive species-- invasive species such as the emerald ash borer and gypsy moth, which are rapidly changing the composition of our forests. In other parts of the country, we are seeing longer wildfire seasons--wildfires that are burning hotter, more intense, and bigger. The Forest Service is spending more and more fighting these fires--now more than half of its entire budget. So we can see that climate change poses a very serious threat to Minnesota, our country, and the world. The Paris Agreement that we will sign tomorrow marks an important step forward to address this threat. But, of course, our job is not done. We have to remain vigilant and build upon the success of the agreement. Internationally, we have to hold other nations accountable, ensure that they commit to stronger emission reduction targets over time, and make sure that those reductions are transparent and verifiable. Domestically, we have to build on the success of our cities and States--like Minnesota--that have been working hard for a long time now to become more energy efficient and reduce emissions. I have two grandchildren, and I am expecting a third later this year. God willing, they will live through this century and into the next. I want them to know that when we had the opportunity to put the Earth on a safer path, we seized the moment. Let's recognize the historic nature of this year's Earth Day, and let's celebrate this climate agreement because it is an important milestone. Let's build on it to make the planet a safer and more habitable place for our grandchildren, their children, and their grandchildren. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from Minnesota, Senator Franken, for his comments concerning an important day tomorrow. It is important for many reasons. We have worked a long time to get the global community engaged on climate change. As Senator Franken pointed out, tomorrow is Earth Day. It will be the [[Page S2379]] 46th anniversary of Earth Day, which was started by our former colleague Senator Gaylord Nelson. He did that because he recognized it is important for this country to recognize our global responsibilities to our environment and to our future. There is no greater challenge that we face than climate change because climate change has been caused, in part, by our own activities here on Earth, by the emission of greenhouse gases. We have a responsibility to reverse the current trends. We can do that. Tomorrow in New York City, many leaders will come to sign the COP21 agreement that was negotiated in Paris earlier this year by 16 nations representing 98 percent of the global greenhouse emissions. This is a historic moment. I want to reflect for a moment about the U.S. leadership that has brought us to this moment in which we now have an agreement among so many countries of the world. We have been trying to do this now for a long time. We have not been successful. At last, the global community has come together with meaningful commitments that will put us on the right path, and the U.S. leadership made this possible. I want to congratulate President Obama for his leadership on this. I was with Secretary Moniz in Paris. Ten members of the U.S. Senate went to Paris during the COP21 negotiations. We were there less than 48 hours, but I think we were able to broadcast the united support for U.S. leadership for a global commitment. Secretary of Energy Moniz took us to the exhibit where we saw firsthand U.S. technology that will help us meet the challenges of climate change--how we can produce energy more efficiently and how we can use energy more efficiently. It was U.S. technology, and that technology will be used around the world. I mention that because U.S. global leadership is critically important to help save our planet from the adverse impacts of climate change, yes, but it also will help our economy. It will help our economy, obviously, in dealing with the effects of climate change but also in U.S. technology being used around the world, creating jobs here in the United States. This is an urgent issue. If I might, let me first quote from Pope Francis. He said: The urgent challenge to protect our common home includes a concern to bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change. . . . I urgently appeal, for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all. . . . Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political, and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. I couldn't agree with him more. This is a global challenge with global, grave consequences if we don't get it right. I see that in my own State of Maryland's Smith Island, which is disappearing into the Chesapeake Bay. I see it in the Chesapeake Bay with the loss of sea grasses because of warmer water temperatures. Sea grasses are critically important to the survival of the Maryland blue crab. I see it in our coastal safety, as we see more and more storms with more consequences. Recently I traveled to the southern part of Africa, and I had a chance to see from a helicopter the impact of climate change. In the southern part of Africa, they have only two seasons: the rainy season and the dry season. They are now at about one season: the dry season. We were there during the rainy season, and by helicopter we flew over land that should have been part of a pond. Instead, it was dry, no water. We saw the carcasses of animals that couldn't survive because of the drought. Climate change is real and is affecting our planet. There are vulnerable nations--from the Marshall Islands to Bangladesh and so many others--whose very existence is at risk because of climate change. This is an urgent issue that requires an urgent response. But here we can make a difference. We can make a difference through conserving and using less energy and producing our energy in a more environmentally friendly way in a carbon-free environment. I am joined by Congressman Delaney and many Members of both the House and Senate in saying that the United States should make a commitment to produce at least 50 percent of our electricity through a carbon-free source by the year 2030. We can do that. Here is the good news. It will not only be good for our environment, it will be good for our economy and good for our national security. Renewable energy sources can be produced here in America. You don't have to depend on the fossil fuels from countries who disagree with our way of life. For the sake of our national security, for the sake of our national economy, there are more jobs in clean energy than there are in fossil fuel industry. For all those reasons--for our economy, for our security, and for our environment--U.S. leadership in dealing with these solutions can help America's security. Yes, U.S. leadership is absolutely vital. We saw that in COP21. Without U.S. leadership, it could not be done. Here is where I really call upon our colleagues. I have said this many times on the floor of the Senate. It is a great honor to serve in the Senate; it is a great honor to represent the people of Maryland. Every Congress has tried to add to its record to protect the future generations as it relates to our environment. The protection of our environment has never been a partisan issue. I would urge our colleagues to find ways that we can work together to build the legacy of this Congress to further protect our environment for future generations. We should be part of the solution. Tomorrow is Earth Day. Let's make a difference. With what we see happening in New York and by our actions, let us protect future generations. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Alexander, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up the following first- degree amendments: Merkley amendment No. 3812, Reid amendment No. 3805, and Flake amendment No. 3820; further, that at 11 a.m., on Tuesday, April 26, the Senate vote on the amendments in the order listed and with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the votes, and that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_168.csv,186229,186229,186298,"[congressional record volume 162, number 62 (thursday, april 21, 2016)] [senate] [pages s2357-s2379] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] energy and water development and related agencies appropriations act, 2016 the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of h.r. 2028, which the clerk will report. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: a bill (h.r. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30, 2016, and for other purposes. pending: alexander/feinstein amendment no. 3801, in the nature of a substitute. alexander amendment no. 3804 (to amendment no. 3801), to modify provisions relating to nuclear regulatory commission fees. alexander (for hoeven) amendment no. 3811 (to amendment no. 3801), to prohibit the use of funds relating to a certain definition. the presiding officer. the senator from maryland. amendment no. 3811 mr. cardin. mr. president, i understand that shortly we are going to be voting on the hoeven amendment. the hoeven amendment would prevent the clean water rule from going into effect. in 1972, congress passed the clean water act in response to what was happening around this country. we saw rivers literally catch on fire as a result of polluted waterways. we had lake erie, which was considered dead. the chesapeake bay was one of the world's first marine dead zones. that is nothing to be proud of. the environment and status of our water was a national disgrace, and through congressional leadership, we passed the clean water act. we did that because we understood that the status of upstream water affects the status of downstream water--that we are all in this together. we understood that having clean water was a public health issue, from swimming in the water to the source of our drinking water supplies. one third of our drinking water supplies come from regulated waters. we also understood it was important for our economy. the status of tourism very much depended upon the quality of our water. literally, people were concerned about going close to some of our inner harbor water areas. the baltimore inner harbor is a tourist attraction, as are the inner harbors of many of our cities. it is important for our economy for agriculture. agriculture depends upon clean water. we understood that when we passed the clean water act in 1972. and we also understood it was a matter of quality of life for the people in our country. from those who hike and do bird watching to those who enjoy fishing and hunting, the status of clean water very much affects the way we enjoy life. as senators from maryland, senator mikulski and i both understand the importance of clean water for the chesapeake bay. the chesapeake bay is a national treasure and the largest estuary in our hemisphere. it was at great risk because of waters coming in from other states into the chesapeake bay watershed, affecting the quality of water of the chesapeake bay. it was for all those reasons that we passed the 1972 clean water act. we understood the enforcement of the waters that were regulated under the 1972 clean water act. it was based upon best science. science told us what we needed to do in order to have clean water-- clean water for our environment, clean water for safe drinking water-- and it was well understood until a supreme court decision. that decision in 2006, known as the rapanos decision, was a 5-to-4 decision of the supreme court, which remanded the case, but it was a 4-to-4 decision on the merits of the case. since that time, there has been uncertainty as to what bodies of water can be regulated under the clean water act. so this was a situation caused by the ambiguity of the supreme court case. it is interesting that the decision on the merits was 4-to-4, as we are now debating whether we are going to have a full supreme court in order to make decisions that affect the clarity of law in this country. the rapanos decision sent back to the lower courts a decision on how to decide this. since that time, there has been uncertainty as to what bodies are legally regulated under the 1972 clean water act. remember, this was 2006. the easiest way to resolve this was for congress to pass a law clarifying the clean water act, but congress has chosen not to do that. so the obama administration has done what it should do, using its power to promulgate a regulation that would provide clarity as to which bodies of water are regulated. guess what. they have done that in a way that is consistent with how the law was enforced prior to the rapanos decision--without much complaint before the rapanos decision. it basically goes back to best science and tells us logically what needs to be regulated. that is what this rule would do: protect our clean water. there is a lot of misinformation that has been given about the clean water rule. quite frankly, normal farming activities don't require any permits under the clean water act. if we listen to some of the arguments against the clean water act, we would have a hard time comparing that to what, in fact, is in the bill. the clean water act would reestablish the well-thought regulatory framework for protecting our clean water so that we don't return to the days of jeopardizing the chesapeake bay or jeopardizing our rivers or jeopardizing our clean water supplies or our environment. tomorrow is earth day. forty-six years ago, our colleague senator gaylord nelson established earth day. what will this congress's legacy be? what will we be remembered for in regards to protecting this planet, protecting our country, and protecting our environment for future generations? i [[page s2358]] hope we will work together to build on the proud accomplishments of our predecessors for clean air and clean water. the first thing we can do is to make sure we reject the hoeven amendment. mr. president, i yield the floor. mr. durbin. mr. president, i come to the floor today in support of the energy and water appropriations bill. i am pleased to see senators alexander and feinstein working to put together a good, bipartisan bill with no ideological or partisan policy riders. they remind us of the way that we should be doing business here in the senate. this legislation provides increased funding for infrastructure across the nation and in my home state of illinois, and i was proud to support it in the appropriations committee. the bill provides strong funding for the national labs through the department of energy, including critical research programs at fermi national accelerator laboratory and argonne national laboratory in illinois. these labs are supporting thousands of scientists from across the country and around the world as they perform pioneering research and transform technologies for science and industry. lab facilities in illinois perform cutting-edge research and are a bright example of american innovation. the energy and water appropriations bill would invest $6 billion in the army corps of engineers, which will help support important investments in illinois infrastructure. waterways in illinois, including the mississippi river, are critical to commerce around the country. they provide access for shipped goods, connecting the great lakes with the gulf of mexico. the army corps also plays an important role in flood control projects, something we saw firsthand in illinois and across the mississippi valley area after flooding this past winter. but there is always more work to be done. according to the american society of civil engineers, america scores a d-minus in investment in levees and inland waterways, and a d in investment in dams. this bill is a good start to making the critical investments we need in american infrastructure. so i am not sure why, after senator alexander and senator feinstein pulled together such a strong bipartisan bill, republicans would want to try to add a poison pill rider preventing an epa rule that keeps our water clean. many economists and military leaders tell us that water will be to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th century. water is going to be that indispensable commodity that makes progress possible; an essential commodity over which wars will be fought. the united states has more clean water today than any other nation on the planet, and it is because of the great lakes. why would we knowingly, deliberately, spoil this precious commodity that is a source of conflict between other nations? we can't afford to stop making a real difference in our clean water supply, and let me tell you why. the epa and army corps clean water rule provides stronger water quality standards to protect our nation's streams, wetlands, and navigable water. these are all resources that we rely heavily on for drinking water and recreation. and one in three americans, or 117 million people, get drinking water from sources that were vulnerable to pollution before the clean water rule. now, more than ever, we must work to ensure our water is safe. we know what can happen when our water supply isn't protected. the flint, mi, water contamination crisis and high lead levels in the water supply in other communities across the country and in illinois are reminders of this. but it is not just lead that we have to worry about. pollutants from factories and sewage treatment plants; waste from confined animal feeding operations; pesticides used on crops; and mining wastewater all flow into tributaries that eventually flow into the great lakes, the source of clean water for 35 million people. attempts to roll back the clean water rule will not only return us to a patchwork of water protections that make it difficult for businesses, farmers, and others to know whether waterways are covered by the law. it will also risk one of our greatest commodities that supports agriculture, recreation, tourism, and energy production. to see the impacts of rolling back these protections, we need to look no further than the gulf of mexico, which has one of the largest dead zones in the world. let me tell you what a dead zone is: dead zones are the result of an overabundance of algae growth, which eventually decompose and steal oxygen from the water, making it hard for anything to live. nutrient runoff from 12 states along the mississippi river trickles down into the gulf of mexico. last year, the dead zone in the gulf of mexico reached 6,474 square miles, roughly the size of the state of connecticut. the state of illinois was one of the largest contributors to this nutrient overload, a combination of runoff from our farm fields and point source pollution such as wastewater plants. we need to reduce this nutrient runoff while protecting our agriculture economy in illinois. the clean water rule does exactly that by exempting agricultural activities from its provisions. i urge my colleagues to vote against any ideological poison pill amendment that would prevent clean water appropriations from moving forward to protect our children, our communities, and our economy. without ideological riders like the clean water rule amendment, the energy and water appropriations bill is a bipartisan effort that proves we can make smart investments that make the most sense for our country--right now and as we plan for our future. the current lead crisis has shown that we need to get serious about investing in infrastructure programs and support regulations to ensure that every american--especially children--has access to safe, clean drinking water. now is the time for congress to act responsibly to develop a budget that enables our country to thrive. thank you. the presiding officer (mr. rubio). the senator from indiana. wasteful spending mr. coats. mr. president, this is no. 40 of ``waste of the week.'' for the 40 weeks the senate has been in session this cycle, i have come down to the floor to talk about a waste of taxpayers' dollars through waste, fraud, and abuse. this week i am going to talk about yet another federal program which has, at best, a questionable track record. i filed an amendment to the energy and water appropriations bill currently in the senate, which is related to this program, and hopefully we will be voting on the amendment i will be offering in a few moments to address this issue. this amendment, which i offered with senators fischer, toomey, and flake, would finally wind down the department of energy's failed advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loan program. remember the stimulus? remember how we were throwing all kinds of taxpayers' money out there? we talked about advanced vehicle programs, and many of these distributions of funds have been misused or simply have not come to fruition, and a great deal of money has been wasted. the atvm loan program continues to sit on billions of dollars of unused funds that could be put to better use. i am glad there are some unused funds there because it means that when we look at the history of this program, perhaps we will have an opportunity to better use those unused funds or to help return it back to the treasury so the taxpayer isn't on the hook for this kind of thing going forward. let me explain this program. the department of energy's advanced vehicle technology manufacturing loan program was created in 2007. it was created to provide very low-interest loans to manufacturers that make vehicles or components of vehicles that use alternative energy. i am not here to downplay the use of alternative energy. i think that is something that is happening throughout our country. hopefully, it is on a market basis. to qualify for this loan, there were a couple of requirements applicants must meet: no. 1, the vehicle or component must be new or significantly improved from what is currently available in the u.s. marketplace; no. 2, it has to be manufactured in the united states. the purpose of the program, partly, was to encourage manufacturing here--not in china, not somewhere else. [[page s2359]] last month, nearly 10 years since the program's inception, the government accountability office took a look at the program's finances and found that the department of energy has billions of unused and unspent funds. i am glad they do because a lot of things that have taken place under this program have not proven to be worth their weight. i have spoken before on a number of programs, but in 2011, under this fund--the alternative vehicle fund--the obama administration approved a $730 million loan to a company called severstal steel company, a russian-owned company with operations in michigan. remember, to qualify for this loan, the alternative fuel vehicle or vehicle part needs to be manufactured in the united states and--here is the key--it must be a new product. technically, severstal was manufacturing in the united states, but the obama administration certainly walked the line in this case. the u.s. government was providing american taxpayer dollars to a russian company owned by one of russia's richest oligarchs, alexei mordashov. the new york times has reported that mr. mordashov has ties to the kremlin and to russian president vladimir putin. apparently, this russian looked at this program and said: hey, here is a way i can get a low-cost, low-interest loan. all i have to do is operate this plant and the government will loan me $750 million and i will produce a new part, a new component of steel that is used in automobile manufacturing. after working with the department of energy's inspector general, senator toomey and i learned that the type of steel made by this russian company was identical to the steel already being produced in my home state of indiana and senator toomey's home state of pennsylvania. obviously, that violated one of the basic criteria in that the product has to be an alternative that is brand new or significantly improved and not something that is already being produced in indiana. fortunately, with the help of the inspector general, we were able to ensure the obama administration voided the loan. to their credit, when we brought it to their attention, they said: ok. we have a russian oligarch we are giving money to--and that doesn't sound very good. we are giving money to this multibillionaire in russia with close ties to vladimir putin. secondly, we now have learned what they are producing is already produced in the united states--in my state of indiana and in senator toomey's state of pennsylvania. thus, fortunately, the administration canceled this loan. this example calls into question the integrity of this program. the atvm program also has a lackluster success rate. for example, fisker automotive received a $529 million loan to produce a $100,000 plug-in hybrid sports car. you will not see any of these on the road because the company went bankrupt after drawing down $193 million of taxpayer funds. another loan recipient, vpg, planned to sell natural gas-powered vans. it went bankrupt after receiving a $50 million government loan. of the five projects funded by this program to date, two of them have gone bankrupt. i think these examples demonstrate what happens when the government tries to pick winners and losers instead of letting the free market determine how we are going to go forward. the coats-fischer-flake-toomey amendment that will be offered would wind down this program and it would make much better use of the unspent funds from this program. i want to be clear. this amendment prohibits doe from reviewing any new loan applications after the bill's enactment. there are currently some pending applications. we do not address those pending applications. i hope serious evaluation will be made relative to whether they qualify under the criteria that is laid out and we will not end up with any more severstals. those who argue that this shuts down an alternative energy program is not valid. anything that is now being currently evaluated up through the end of 2020, the next 5 years--will be allowed to go forward and be evaluated under the program. the amendment doesn't take that away. cbo scored this amendment as saving at least $300 million over the next 10 years. i have been down here every week talking about a waste of the week. i have just identified another waste of taxpayer dollars. we are not counting that, but we are counting what we can save if this amendment is adopted. it is $300 million. i think that is a significant amount it raises our waste, fraud, and abuse level to $162 billion and change. i encourage my colleagues to work with us so we can offer this amendment. remember, it does not affect anybody who has a proposal before the department of energy under this loan program. if that is underway, it can be evaluated--hopefully successfully evaluated, and if it doesn't qualify the criteria, won't be accepted. the amendment does not free funds for anything that is not currently before the evaluators of this program. i trust we can gain the support of my colleagues in saving the taxpayers some dollars. with that, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mrs. boxer. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 3811 mrs. boxer. mr. president, we are going to vote on the hoeven amendment shortly. i rise to speak against that amendment, which would undermine one of our nation's landmark environmental laws, the clean water act. it is very difficult for me to understand how we could be at this point in time attacking a clean water rule--a clean water rule in light of what has happened in flint, mi. this is what the water looked like as it came out of the tap in flint at the height of the crisis. by the way, people were told this was safe. why on earth would we be going against the clean water rule at a time when we are fighting against this kind of problem? this is what the pipes looked like in flint: the corrosion, the obvious problems with lead. this was all getting right into the drinking water. while we look for ways to help the people of flint--and i would love do it on this bill. if we can't do it on this bill, i would love do it on the wrda bill. if we can't do it on the wrda bill, i will do it on any bill. we need to take care of what happened there, and we also need to help other communities from the east coast to the middle of our nation, to the west coast and help us help our families. here we have in the face of flint an attack on the clean water rule. let's see what else we have to say and what else we learned about what happened in flint. pregnant women, kids cautioned over jackson water. this is in mississippi. jackson, ms, also has a problem with lead. what is our response to that today? to stop a clean water rule. what are my republican friends thinking? it doesn't make sense. the associated press wrote this: ``elevated lead levels found in newark schools' drinking water.'' here we are talking about elevated levels of lead in newark. we have places in california where the kids can't drink the water out of a water fountain. so what is the response of the republican senate? turn back a clean water rule. it makes absolutely no sense. what we have going on, on the senate floor, is a very heated debate, as i speak, about how to handle the issue in flint. let me tell you this. the first thing to do in the light of flint is not to weaken environmental law, is not to stop a clean water rule. it is completely ridiculous. my friends will say: all we are doing is delaying implementation for a year while the court looks at it. we shouldn't be doing anything that plays into the hands of those special interests that simply don't want to clean up the water in our nation. the clean water standards that are a target of this amendment are designed to safeguard drinking water for america's families and businesses. this dangerous amendment rolls back protections of small streams and wetlands that provide drinking water to one in three americans. that is 117 million people put at risk because this u.s. senate, run by the republicans, [[page s2360]] thinks the best thing to do in the light of flint is to roll back the clean water act. come on. get a life. read the paper. look at what happened to those people. this is the time to provide reliable drinking water to all americans and to clean up our waterways. now is not the time--and it should not be the time--to attack the clean water act, which is vital to the health and safety of our families. i want to mention that i have received opposition to the hoeven amendment from numerous sportsmen's groups, including backcountry hunters and anglers, international federation of fly fishers, national wildlife federation, theodore roosevelt conservation partnership, and trout unlimited. these groups understand the important link between clean water and the outdoor recreation economy. when you go right after the clean water rule, you are going after the people who enjoy outdoor recreation, and they are against the hoeven amendment. leading environmental and conservation groups oppose the amendment, including american rivers, clean water action, earthjustice, earthworks, environment america, environmental defense fund, league of conservation voters, natural resources defense council, prairie rivers network, sierra club, and southern environmental law center. these are some of the most popular groups in the country. does anyone know what the rating of this republican congress was in the last polls i saw? it was 14 percent. do you know what the rating of the president was in the last poll i saw? over 50. so what does the republican senate do today? they are going after the president with their 14-percent rating in the polls. i say to my friends on the other side--and believe me, they are my friends: what are you doing? how do you expect people to support you when you, after seeing what happened in flint, continue to go after landmark environmental clean water laws like you are doing today? in addition, public health groups, including the american public health association, physicians for social responsibility, and trust for america's health, have opposed similar legislation to block this important rule, and 200,000 businesses represented by the american sustainable business council have called on senators to oppose efforts to block the clean water rule. these experts understand the importance of the clean water rule, and they know that our drinking water remains vulnerable to pollution. just last month, epa released a report showing that nearly half of u.s. waterways are in poor condition. in fact, one in four waterways have levels of bacteria that fail to meet human health standards, and our children go swimming in these very waterways. we have cities across the united states with sewer systems that discharge raw, untreated sewage in waterways--again, where our children swim. it is a disgrace. despite enormous successes since passage of the clean water act, we have more work to do. nothing is more important than protecting the lives of the american people, whether it is through our military or through our public health laws. when we weaken the clean water act, as the hoeven amendment will do, we put our families and our children at risk. why are we here? flint has put a spotlight on the need to keep our families safe from toxins and pollutants in their drinking water. the first thing the republicans do in light of flint is to try to roll back the clean water rule. i have to say that one of my deepest regrets--and i have written about it--is how partisan this place has become over environmental laws. when i started a long time ago, republicans were the ones leading the way on the environment. i remember there was a republican state senator named peter behr, whom i supported because he understood how critical it was to protect and defend the environment, not only as a legacy to our children in terms of the beauty of our planet but also for the very health and safety of our families. i have been in office for 40 years. it is hard to believe that it has been 40 years. i guess time flies when you like your work. the fact is that no one has ever come up to me and said: barbara, our water and air is too pure and way too clean. you need to do something about that. you need to dirty it up. repeal the landmark laws, barbara, that protect our water. they don't do that. they come up and say: we are worried about the fact that we are not sure what contaminants are in our water. i see my good friend is going to close out the debate, and i promised him that when he came to the floor, he wouldn't have to listen too long. i say again: please vote against the hoeven amendment. this is not smart legislation in light of what we face. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i will yield the floor to the good senator from michigan for a minute. the presiding officer. the senator from michigan. ms. stabenow. mr. president, i wanted to make a quick statement about an amendment that will come up for consideration on the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from california. mrs. boxer. mr. president, of course i support my friend from michigan, but we need to quickly move to a vote on the amendment. the presiding officer. the senator from michigan. ms. stabenow. mr. president, i wanted to quickly take a moment to speak about the vehicle program from two sides. when i authored this legislation back in 2007, we began to see fuel economy standards increase in the united states. part of our focus at that time was to keep jobs in america and make sure we had low-cost financing available for companies, such as retool plants, so that smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles would be made in the united states rather than have those jobs shipped overseas. we saw that with the initial loan made to ford motor company. they were able to bring jobs back from mexico and also focus on electric vehicles. as we fast forward to today, we are looking at fuel economy for trucks and larger vehicles. a loan was recently made to alcoa. they are focused on aluminum materials so companies can make lighter weight trucks in order to meet new fuel economy standards. there are positives, but there are also areas under this loan program that have not been successful. i come to the floor to specifically say that when it is time to consider the coats amendment, which will completely eliminate this program, my colleagues need to know that we are undercutting a carefully crafted bipartisan compromise with senator inhofe, senator portman, and others to move forward on a water infrastructure plan to deal with lead in water that will not only help 100,000 people in the city of flint, but it will also help people in jackson, ms, cleveland, oh, and other states across the country. our proposal responsibly phases out this program and uses the funds for critical water infrastructure needs. we strongly oppose pulling the rug out from under not only flint but also jackson, ms, cleveland, oh, and communities across the country that are counting on us to come together and pass what we have done in a bipartisan way to address critical water infrastructure needs and deal with the lead poisoning issues. i ask colleagues to vote no on the coats amendment and allow us to phase out this program in a way so that we will be able to use this investment in a critical way to address water infrastructure needs across the country. i thank the presiding officer. the presiding officer. the senator from north dakota. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i am willing to yield to the junior senator from michigan. the presiding officer. the junior senator from michigan. mr. peters. mr. president, i concur with my colleague from michigan, senator stabenow. we urge our colleagues [[page s2361]] to vote no on the coats amendment. this is part of a very carefully crafted amendment to deal with water infrastructure around the country, and in particular flint. i think this will be a win-win for those folks who may want to see this program go away. we have a plan to do that while also dealing with an incredibly important issue not only for our state but that is also incredibly important to other states across the country. i urge a ``no'' vote. i thank the senator for yielding the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from north dakota. amendment no. 3811 mr. hoeven. mr. president, i rise today to ask my colleagues to support an amendment i offered, amendment no. 3811, that prevents the epa and the corps of engineers from implementing its waters of the united states final rule. the language for my amendment is actually identical to the waters of the united states provision in the underlying bill. it is already in the bill, h.r. 2028, which we are considering right now. my amendment will make sure that this waters of the united states provision stays in the bill and that our bill is consistent with legislation supported by the house. it is critical to preserve the prohibition on implementing the waters of the united states because this rule will greatly expand the scope of epa regulations over nearly every water in the united states, threatening farmers and job creators with permitting requirements and litigation that will make it more difficult for them to produce our nation's food and complete needed construction projects. moreover, this regulatory overreach by the army corps of engineers and the epa is inconsistent with the law. let's look at what the courts are saying. when granting a preliminary injunction against this rule, the north dakota federal district court stated: the rule allows epa regulation of waters that do not bear any effect on the ``chemical, physical and biological integrity'' of any navigable-in-fact water. it went on further to state: the rule asserts jurisdiction over waters that are remote and intermittent waters. no evidence actually points to how these intermittent and remote wetlands have any nexus to navigable-in-fact water. that is the key. epa has jurisdiction over navigable bodies of water, not ephemeral water that might be in a ditch today and gone tomorrow. meanwhile, the sixth circuit court of appeals issued a nationwide stay of the rule, in cincinnati, citing that epa and the corps of engineers did not identify ``specific scientific support substantiating the reasonableness of the bright-line standards they ultimately chose.'' to get a sense of the size of the federal power grab we are talking about here, consider that under the administration's final rule, all water located within 4,000 feet of any other water or within the 100- year floodplain is considered a water of the united states as long as the epa or the army corps of engineers decides that it has ``significant nexus.'' that is the argument the epa is making-- ``significant nexus.'' they are saying: well, we can regulate navigable bodies of water. they just decided, without statutory authority provided by this congress or any other authority, that because other waters run into navigable bodies, they can regulate all water, and they have issued a regulation to do that. the waters of the united states is clearly flawed from a legal perspective, but it is even more important to take a look at how this rule, if implemented, affects hard-working americans with excessive regulations. for those of you who haven't had the opportunity to visit with a farmer from my state or any farmers across this country, do so. they will tell you how difficult it is to deal with excess water on their property, particularly when they face an overbearing regulation like this one. those farmers can tell you that just because there is water in a ditch or field one week doesn't mean that there will be water there next week. it certainly doesn't make the water worthy of being treated the same as a river, a lake, or a navigable body of water. a field with a low spot that has standing water---- the presiding officer. the senator's time has expired. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i ask that the members of this body not only consider the underlying issue and the impact it will have on farmers and ranchers. it will also affect everybody's private property rights. i also ask my colleagues to consider their own prerogative. under our constitution we have legislative, judicial, and executive branches, and each has its own authority. we have to stand up on this one when an agency overreaches and takes statutory authority we have not provided. i ask that members join with me in support of this vitally important amendment. with that, i thank the chair and i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from tennessee. mr. alexander. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that following locking in the votes, the senator from california have an opportunity to speak and then that we move to the vote. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. mr. alexander. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up the following amendments: franken amendment no. 3833, coats amendment no. 3814, and murray amendment no. 3813; further, that following the disposition of the hoeven amendment no. 3811, the senate vote on the coats amendment no. 3814, with a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption of the amendment; and that at 1:45 p.m. today, the senate vote on the franken amendment no. 3833; finally, that at 5:30 p.m. on monday, april 25, the senate vote on the murray amendment no. 3813, with no second-degree amendments in order to any of the amendments prior to the votes, and that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote. may i say before the senator from california speaks, i see the senators from michigan are here and the senator from indiana. i wish to thank the three of them for working with senator feinstein and me toward the goal of making sure that senators who have a germane amendment have the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote. if we are able to follow that practice generally, we will be able to have an appropriations process and the senate will function well. they all responded quickly and promptly on issues they feel very strongly about, and i thank them for it. the presiding officer. is there objection to the request? without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from california. amendment no. 3811 mrs. feinstein. mr. president, i want to say a few words. the junior senator from california has been speaking in opposition to the waters of the united states amendment sponsored by senator hoeven. i just want to put before the body a little bit of the history. in 2006 the supreme court introduced real uncertainty regarding which wetlands and water bodies were subject to federal jurisdiction under the clean water act. since 2006 the epa and the u.s. army corps of engineers have been working on new rules to clarify their jurisdiction and address the supreme court's ruling. epa and the army corps just finalized the new rule last may. this new rule helps resolve almost a decade of confusion by clearly stating which types of water bodies are subject to federal jurisdiction and which are not. it will make federal permitting easier, faster, and less costly for business and industry. it maintains all previous exemptions and exclusions for normal farming and ranching practices and agricultural discharges, such as irrigation return flow and storm water runoff. nevertheless, the sixth circuit court of appeals has issued a stay suspending implementation of the rule. i strongly believe we should let the courts decide whether the executive branch has overreached in its interpretation of congressional statute, just like the constitution calls for. the president has threatened to veto the entire energy and water appropriations bill if this amendment is included in it. right now, we have the best opportunity in 7 years to pass this bill as a stand-alone piece of legislation and [[page s2362]] get the senate appropriations process working again. so i am very hopeful and would strongly recommend that the senate defeat the hoeven amendment. thank you very much, mr. president. the presiding officer. the question is on agreeing to the hoeven amendment no. 3811. mr. alexander. mr. president, i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second? there appears to be a sufficient second. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk called the roll. mr. cornyn. the following senator is necessarily absent: the senator from texas (mr. cruz). mr. durbin. i

tennessee. mr. alexander. madam president, in a moment senator coats will call up his amendment, the coats and toomey amendment. i want to thank the michigan senators and others for making the schedule work today. for the information of all senators, after the coats amendment, the next vote will be at 1:45 p.m. on the franken amendment. that will be the last vote today. the next vote will be on the murray amendment on monday afternoon. senators and their staffs have been very good about getting their amendments in. we think we have all the amendments. we have asked to have them by 1 p.m. so we could by consensus finish up on monday and tuesday, giving everybody a chance to have their vote if it is a germane amendment and to speak on the germane amendments. my request on behalf of senator feinstein and me is that if there are any amendments still out there, we would like to have them by 1 o'clock. amendment no. 3814 to amendment no. 3801 the presiding officer. there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment no. 3814, to be offered by the senator from indiana, mr. coats. mr. coats. madam president, i call up my amendment no. 3814. the presiding officer. the clerk will report. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from indiana [mr. coats] proposes an amendment numbered 3814 to amendment no. 3801. the amendment is as follows: (purpose: to limit the use of funds made available for the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loan program) on page 30, line 9, strike the period at the end and insert the following: ``: provided, that none of the funds made available under this heading shall be used to administer, review, or approve any loan or loan application that was not submitted as of the date of enactment of this act: provided further, that none of the funds available to the secretary of energy to provide any credit subsidy under subsection (d) of section 136 of the energy independence and security act of 2007 (42 u.s.c. 17013) as of the date of enactment of this act shall be obligated for new loan commitments under that subsection on or after october 1, 2020.''. mr. coats. madam president, 205 loans issued by the department of energy under the alternative vehicle program have failed, costing taxpayers $500 million in losses. doe currently sits on $4 billion of unused money. it is time to wind down this program. this will not affect any proposals that are currently with the department of energy on this program, but it will prevent any new programs going forward. we can save the taxpayers a lot of money and use this for other alternatives if we adopt this amendment. i yield the remainder of my time to the senator from pennsylvania. the presiding officer. the senator from pennsylvania. mr. toomey. madam president, this is exactly the kind of program our constituents hate. it is the crony capitalism where taxpayers are forced to subsidize preferred companies, special interests. how many hundreds of millions of dollars do taxpayers have to lose? i understand there is some discussion that maybe on some bill in the future, this will get phased out as part of another deal, but who knows if that is ever going to happen. here is a chance to wipe out some crony capitalism, some corporate welfare, and a huge loss for taxpayers. the presiding officer. the senator's time has expired. mr. toomey. let's adopt this amendment. the presiding officer. the senator from michigan. mr. peters. madam president, i would certainly urge all of my colleagues to oppose the coats amendment. what this does is eliminate a program that basically pays for a very carefully crafted agreement on which we are working to deal with the flint water issue, as well as water infrastructure issues all across this country. this is part of the proposal senator stabenow and i have been working on and have been building support. we are looking to move to this very shortly to deal with this broad issue. a vote against this amendment allows us to continue to move forward with a bipartisan plan, critical for our whole country. i yield my remaining time to the senior senator from michigan. the presiding officer. the senator from michigan. ms. stabenow. madam president, the bottom line is that we have developed a bipartisan bill that phases out this program in a responsible way for the businesses that are currently involved and uses that to pay for water infrastructure needs across the country, not only in flint but in jackson, mi, and cleveland, oh--across the country. so we can achieve what the senators are talking about in a way that helps us with water infrastructure. i urge a ``no'' vote. the presiding officer. the senator's time has expired. the question is on agreeing to amendment no. 3814. mr. hatch. madam president, i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second? there appears to be a sufficient second. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. mr. cornyn. the following senators are necessarily absent: the senator from missouri (mr. blunt) and the senator from texas (mr. cruz). mr. durbin. i announce that the senator from vermont (mr. sanders) is necessarily absent. the presiding officer. are there any other senators in the chamber desiring to vote?

rejected. the senator from arizona. tribute to sandy ledy mr. flake. madam president, i rise today to recognize sandy ledy, a dedicated senate staff member who will retire after more than two decades of public service in my office. soon after being elected to the senate in 1994, senator john kyl was wise enough to offer sandy--a standout campaign volunteer--a job on his new staff. sandy was given two options: she could work as a staffer in washington, dc, or she could serve in arizona and serve as john kyl's military case worker. sandy knew she couldn't pass up an opportunity to serve those who serve our nation. it was an easy decision for sandy and a fortuitous one for arizona's military servicemembers, veterans, and their families. sandy's genuine passion for our military service men and women, combined with her meticulous approach to her work, has made her an invaluable staffer. sandy is well-versed in all things military, from regulations, to benefits, to the service academies. her vast knowledge has ensured that arizona's military service men and women have had nothing but the best assistance for more than the past two decades. her reputation preceded her, and when i was elected as senator in 2012, i had an easy decision of my own--offering sandy a job on my staff. thankfully, she said yes. sandy is probably best known around the state as the point person for service academy nominations. her understanding of that process and what it takes for a student to be an excellent nominee has helped so many students fulfill their dreams of attending one of our prestigious service academies. her focus on preparation and attention to detail has turned what can be a very daunting task into a seamless production, resulting in countless nominations and appointments to the service academies. while we all marvel at sandy's meticulousness, it is her compassion and calm demeanor that make her such an asset. this is never more evident than when she is working with students and parents in the long and complicated process of applying to attend one of these service academies. beyond her work on behalf of the military, she is an active and cherished member of her community in cave creek, az. she is a member of her church choir, a regular volunteer at the cave creek museum, and a longtime swim coach, sometimes judging local meets. but there is no better testament to sandy's example as a public servant than her two children, amy and joe. amy is a graduate of the u.s. air force academy who herself recently retired after a career in the military. joe served in the u.s. marine corps. they have made her the proud grandmother of three, and she is looking forward to spending a well-deserved retirement looking after those grandkids. sandy, thank you for more than 20 years of dedicated public service in the senate and, in particular, for the 4 years of stellar service as a member of my staff. your knowledge and passion will be greatly missed. i wish you well in your retirement. i yield back the remainder of my time. the presiding officer. the senator from rhode island. comprehensive addiction and recovery bill mr. whitehouse. madam president, i am on the floor with my colleague senator portman to join him in urging the house to take prompt action on the comprehensive addiction and recovery act, which passed with such a stunning bipartisan vote in the senate. as senator portman has pointed out, years of careful preparation went into the drafting of this bill. there were five separate national hearings held in washington with people from all over the country. this is a very polished and carefully developed piece of legislative work that has the support not only of the addiction and recovery community but of the law enforcement community and many others. senator portman has been very diligent about coming to the floor to press for action from the house of representatives. my view is that since the house of representatives is under republican control, they are more likely to be attentive to the urgings of a republican senator--particularly one who has served in the house of representatives--than they are to me. but i want to make sure the record is clear that i fully support rapid passage of this bill, whether it is something that is close enough that we can quickly get it through conference or whether it is our bill, to which they are free to add things as they wish over time, but can get to the president now--the reason i think it is important that it get to the president now is we are in the appropriations process. the appropriators for these accounts need to know what they are appropriating to. so time is of the essence, not just because of the lives that are being lost day-to-day and month-to-month out there but also because our appropriators need to know. i urge my colleagues in the house of representatives, democrats and republicans alike, to listen to the distinguished senator from ohio. let's try to get this done. with that, i yield to senator portman with my thanks and appreciation. the presiding officer. the senator from ohio. mr. portman. first, madam president, i want to thank my colleague from rhode island who just spoke. we did work together for the past few years in putting together this legislation, and we did it, by the way, with the house of representatives. so senator whitehouse and i took good ideas wherever we could find them, in whatever part of the country it came from, including ideas from the house of representatives. we didn't ask who had the idea; we asked whether it was a good idea. we kept this entirely nonpartisan, not just bipartisan. therefore, we built something that makes sense for our communities back home to deal with this epidemic of prescription drug and heroin addiction and overdoses. i appreciate his partnership in this, and i appreciate the fact that he came to the floor today to talk about the importance of moving ahead with this legislation. after all, it is very rare around here to get a 94-to-1 vote on anything, and we did it on this bill. after 2\1/2\ weeks on the floor of the senate talking about this heroin and prescription drug epidemic, every single senator here realized this was a problem in their states, and 94 senators stood up and agreed this legislation will help address it. by the way, since we passed the comprehensive addiction and recovery act, or cara, as it is called, on march 10 in the senate, 42 days have passed. that is more than a month. every day, we lose about 120 americans--120 americans--to drug overdoses. that means in these 42 days we have lost over 5,000 fellow american citizens to drug overdoses. think about that. i do urge the house to act and act quickly. these numbers keep getting higher and higher. this is not getting better. back in ohio, this is getting worse, and i assume the same is true in your state, if you are a senator or if you are a member of the house of representatives in your district. since 2007, we have looked at these numbers, and drug overdoses have killed more ohioans than car accidents. it is now the no. 1 cause of accidental death in ohio. it has tripled [[page s2364]] from 1999 to 2010. we are now told, by the way, that 200,000 ohioans are addicted to opioids--opioids are prescription drugs--and heroin-- 200,000 ohioans. that is the size of a significant city in any state represented here in this body or any district on the other side. in fact, it is the same size as the city of akron, oh, where i was on monday of this week, meeting with their opioid task force. they are alarmed at what is happening, and they want to be sure we are making every possible effort we can on the prevention side, the education side, to get more people into treatment, to get them into longer term recovery, to provide police officers and other first responders with narcan, the miracle drug they need to stop overdoses from turning into a death. they want our help. they support the cara legislation. they need it, and they need it now. the cincinnati enquirer had some really troubling news last week. they wrote a story about a new poll that is out. it is a group called interact for health. they do an annual ohio health issues poll. they found in the poll in 2014 that 2 of every 10 ohioans knew someone who was abusing prescription drugs. a year later, it is 3 in 10, so this is not getting better. this is getting worse. by the way, this is just prescription drugs. and by the way, of the 3 in 10 who knew somebody who is abusing prescription drugs, 4 in 10--4 in 10--knew somebody who had overdosed on those prescription drugs. so these percentages are increasing across the board--every age group, every education level, every income level. there is no demographic, no zip code, no state, no city, and no county that is safe from this epidemic. it is spreading, and it is spreading everywhere. this poll is another indication that we have a lot of work to do. this should be a motivation for us. this should get us to pass this legislation. and, yes, can we work on additional legislation? of course, we can and should. i am encouraged that the house is taking up new bills and looking at this in different ways. that is good. but we know here in the senate and over in the house that this cara legislation will help and will help now. by the way, there are over 120 cosponsors of the cara legislation in the house. not only did we work with them and introduce identical legislation in the house and the senate, anticipating this day when we could pass it in one house, but we wanted to pass it quickly in the other house and get it to the president for his signature. there are over 120 cosponsors over there. it is bipartisan. think of the impact we could have on the community if we could get this passed. if we could turn around just one life, it matters, and we know this can save many lives and make many people begin to look at this issue differently--that this is a disease. addiction is a disease and needs to be treated as such. removing some of that stigma alone will bring a lot more people into treatment, and that is part of what is important about this legislation. there is another issue that is not prescription drugs, and it is not heroin, but it is another issue related to it, and that is fentanyl. fentanyl is being laced with heroin throughout the country. in cleveland, oh, a couple of weeks ago, we lost 12 people--12 people--in 6 days to overdoses. that is one city. this was heroin, but it was laced with this even more dangerous toxic substance called fentanyl. by the way, it comes in the mail. the drug dealers are shipping it in the mail. fentanyl is so toxic--10 to 30 to 40 times more toxic than heroin-- that it is dangerous even to open up the mail if you are an inspector, we are told. we had a hearing on this just this week. we talked to the customs and border patrol people: our question was, why can't we stop this stuff from coming in? this, unfortunately, is something that is also increasing. ohio, they say, is one of the top states in the country in terms of fentanyl overdoses. but i will tell those who have not dealt with this fentanyl issue yet that it creates even more issues because it is so deadly. after 3 years of work on this cara legislation, senator whitehouse and i and others, including senators on both sides of the aisle--we did hold five forums, as he said, on various aspects of this debate. we consulted with the experts on treatment and recovery, the experts who are focused on how to keep kids and other people from making these bad decisions in the prevention and the education community. we met with the drug experts from the administration, such as the white house office of national drug control policy. we brought in people from all over the country, including from my home state of ohio. this is the third time i have come to the floor. i have come once every week that we have been in session since we passed it to say to the house: let's move on cara. let's get it done. it will help immediately. the majority leader in the house has said he wants the house to take on the drug epidemic and pass legislation soon. i believe him. he is a good man. i appreciate that. but i would ask him again to please work on the other legislation. it is fine to take them through hearings and markups, but we cannot delay. we know cara will work, and it will work now. it is sitting over there and ready for action. it can be taken to the floor immediately under suspension and can be passed. we are one vote away from having this go to the president and having it go to help in our communities. the chairman of the house energy and commerce committee, fred upton, who is a good friend and a man with a big heart and cares about this issue, has said he would like the house to move quickly with, as he said, an ``all hands on deck effort.'' good for him. one of his subcommittees, the health subcommittee, recently marked up a dozen bills. this happened yesterday; they marked up 12 bills. look at those bills. a number of them are actually a part of cara already. they are in cara. they are smaller bills. none of them is comprehensive, like cara. one reason we have to get cara passed is this is a problem that has to be addressed from all angles, from all sectors, and that is why it has to be comprehensive. but of those 12 bills that were marked up yesterday, many of them are identical, and others are very similar to the cara legislation. so this shouldn't slow us down. in fact, it is even more an indication that if these are the kinds of bills the house thinks are the right way to go, let's get cara passed and then we can work on the other legislative ideas members may have. i respect my colleagues--chairman upton, the majority leader over there, and chairman pence, the chairman of the subcommittee and also a guy who cares a lot about this issue--but let's give cara a vote. there are 125 cosponsors. that is the latest number i have as of this morning, and the number keeps growing. it is bipartisan, it is bicameral, and it is the right thing to do. again, i know there are other ideas out there, and that is fine. we need to take those up as well. but let's go ahead and get this passed. put it under suspension, and take it to the floor. it will pass. we are one vote away from having this help our communities. cara is not just comprehensive; it does the right thing in terms of focusing on what is evidence based. in other words, we didn't just say ``let's throw more money at this problem,'' we said ``let's actually find out what is working and what is not working.'' i was in dayton, oh, with a group called project c.u.r.e. on friday. i had the chance to visit with some of the administrators there, some of the recovery coaches, as they call themselves, many of whom, by the way, are recovering themselves. they are doing an amazing job. i talked to many of the patients who were there. they are people who are recovering addicts. some have been clean for 2 weeks, some clean for 2 years. but i asked them the same question i ask all over our state: what works? what doesn't work? how did this happen? most of them, by the way, told me the same story you hear time and again: it started with prescription drugs. in fact, one story was from a man by the name of anthony. he dropped out of high school at age 14, got into drugs, and made some mistakes in his life, which he readily acknowledges. he ended up in prison. he said he had eight convictions and was in and out of prison, in and out of the drug world. he decided to go straight. [[page s2365]] he made a decision. for him, a lot of it was faith based and a lot was being sure he was going to be able to take care of his family and be a contributing member of his community, so he gave back. anthony had a good job, had gotten married, and was on the right track. he was on his way to work one day, and he was in a car accident. for those experts who are listening to this today, you probably know happened. i don't even have to tell you. when he got in the car accident, he was injured. they sent him to the hospital. what did they give him at the hospital? narcotic pain pills, percocet, prescription drugs. immediately--immediately--anthony became addicted again. he is now struggling, but he is back at the treatment center. he is getting his life back together again. but in the meantime he has lost his family because the drugs became everything. he lost his job because the drugs became everything. we talk a lot about the overdoses, and they are horrible--120 americans a day. we don't talk enough about those who aren't overdosing but who have lost their ability to achieve their own god-given purpose in life because the drugs are everything. so they have lost their families--torn apart. they have lost their jobs. they have lost their ability to be contributing members of our society. and those people who get into treatment and longer term recovery, as anthony is doing, can turn their lives around. there is hope. it can work. anthony is back for a second chance. having talked to him, i believe he is not just on the right track but he will work through this. this legislation is needed to help him. when i do meet with recovering addicts, i ask them to look at the legislation, look at the summaries, and tell me what they think. what they tell me is they like it because they are convinced it would help others to have the access to treatment they have. probably only 1 out of 10 of those people who are addicted are getting treatment. that is the best number i have. maybe it is a little higher than that in your state or congressional district, but this is an issue where, if we provide more resources for treatment and begin to remove that stigma around treatment and get more people into a system where they can begin to get their lives back together with treatment, we know that works. our legislation supports veterans task forces and veterans courts because we know this will help with our veterans who are coming back with ptsd, 20 percent of whom have this addiction. people say it is self-medicating. they have self-medicated to the point that they are now addicts. we need to put them not into a prison cell but into a treatment program. that is what these veterans courts do, and they surround these veterans with other veterans. they do an awesome job. i have been to them in ohio. you have them probably in your state. if you don't, this legislation will help because it creates more veterans courts. we have talked on the floor before about the fact that there has been a huge increase--a 750 percent increase in the state of ohio--in babies born with addiction. that is just in the last 12 years in ohio. go to any neonatal unit in your state or congressional district, and you will see these babies. they are being lovingly cared for by doctors and nurses. they are taking these addicted babies you could hold in the palm of your hand, and they are literally taking them through withdrawal. they have to because these babies are addicted and showing the symptoms you might see in an adult of addiction. we don't know what the long-term consequences are. we are having a hearing on this tomorrow in cleveland, oh, at one of our great hospitals--university hospitals rainbow babies & children's hospital. it is one of the best children's hospitals in the country. their neonatal unit is doing awesome work. i have been there and seen it. we are going to talk to the experts about this and how we can do even better to help these babies. but wouldn't it be great if we didn't have so many babies born with addiction because mothers, knowing the consequences, dealt with their addiction problem to avoid it through prevention and education efforts? wouldn't it be great if we didn't have this 750-percent increase in children whose futures are uncertain because of being born with this addiction? again, there is hope. i have been to a women's recovery center in cleveland and columbus and also in eastern ohio and athens, oh, where i have met with women in long-term recovery with drug addiction. they are there with their kids. there is hope. with this legislation, we do have the ability to give people more hope. getting rid of that stigma, not judging people, is part of beating this epidemic, and cara will do that by treating addiction like a disease. there is an opportunity for us to move, and move quickly, to address this growing crisis we have in our states and our communities; that is, to pass this cara legislation. is it all we should do? no. of course we should do more. i know the house of representatives will have some great ideas. i know there are some great ideas in this body. the help committee is working on additional ideas on how to get more medicine into this area of addiction, science, and treatment. they are working on ways to ensure that we can provide more help to people. that is great, and we should continue to work on that. meanwhile, we know this legislation will help. we know that if it is sitting on the desk in the house of representatives, having passed the senate by a 94-to-1 vote, it is not going to help. but we know if it can get off the desk and onto the floor for a vote, we are one vote away from getting it to our communities to begin to help, to keep people from making the wrong decision--but then if they get into a drug addiction, it can help them to be able to turn their lives around and to achieve their potential in life, their god-given potential. that is what this argument is about. it is not about the fact that the senate has all the answers. by the way, we wrote this legislation with the house. they were engaged from the start. we introduced identical bills and they had 125 cosponsors. all we are saying is, let's let this one piece of legislation go, let's allow it to begin to help right away, and then let's continue to work on other ideas. again, we have lost nearly 5,000 americans to drug overdoses since the senate passed cara with a 94-to-1 vote. to begin to reverse this tide--this trend of addiction, of overdoses--we can and should act now. it is urgent. there is a crisis. there is no time to waste. madam president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from virginia. mr. warner. madam president, i wish to thank my friend for his comments about addiction. i agree with the senator from ohio, talking about the victims from ohio. i can assure him we have victims in virginia and all across the country, and we need to get this legislation to the president's desk so people who are hurt by the scourge of drugs can get the treatment they need. again, i thank him for his leadership. nomination of merrick garland madam president, i rise to again express my disappointment that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have continued to obstruct consideration of an eminently qualified candidate to fill the vacancy on the supreme court. it has now been 36 days since president obama nominated judge merrick garland; that is, 36 days that our highest court has been relegated to falling short of its full constitutional obligations. make no mistake. the senate's inaction is already having a tangible impact on the court's ability to function effectively. during the current session, we have seen our eight current justices end up in a 4-to-4 deadlock in three separate cases since justice scalia's passing--effectively muting the court's voice in consequential judicial proceedings. president reagan himself said: ``every day that passes with a supreme court below full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' more recently, retired justice sandra day o'connor put it quite simply, as she always does. she said: ``i think we need somebody there now to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' indeed, the supreme court has granted only three cases since justice scalia [[page s2366]] died--a number experts say is extraordinarily low and an indication that the eight sitting justices are acutely aware of the precarious position the court is in with a vacancy. many senators apparently believe that president obama shouldn't be able to make appointments under article ii because he is in the last year of his term. the record shows there is nothing in the constitution that says the president is only president for 3 of the 4 years of his or her term. i don't understand that reasoning. under that reasoning, any of those same senators who have made that argument shouldn't be voting on any bill that comes before this body in the last year of their senate term. if we continue with that rationale, the president's office and the senate would lead to further dysfunction. quite honestly, that logic is beyond the pale. it is clear as well that the american people expect us to do our job. recent polls show that by a 2-to-1 margin americans want the senate to hold hearings and vote on judge garland's nomination. that is why i remain so perplexed by the logical contortions that many of my colleagues are undertaking to justify their obstruction and quite honestly their failure to do their job. i had the chance to meet with judge garland last week. his qualifications and dedication to public service are beyond reproach. he has received strong bipartisan support in the past, but what also stood out to me are his measured view of the role of the judiciary, his strong record on national security, and commitment to keeping our country safe. this past tuesday marked the 21st anniversary of the bombing of a federal building in oklahoma city. on that tragic day in 1995, 168 people, including 19 children, lost their lives. to this day, the oklahoma city bombing remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in our nation's history. judge garland at that time was principal associate deputy attorney general. he was the guy who led the criminal investigation and supervised the prosecution of the bombers. merrick garland fought for justice for the victims and the families in oklahoma city. through his tireless efforts, deep understanding of the law, and attention to detail, he ensured that the prosecution had an airtight case. ultimately, both bombers were successfully convicted. this is the highest profile instance in which judge garland exhibited his commitment to making and keeping our country safe, but it is far from the only one. in my meeting with him, it was clear that the safety and security of our citizens is an issue that quite honestly keeps him up at night. what also stands out about my conversation with judge garland is his sense of humility. our conversation and his judicial record demonstrate to me that he is a moderate, thoughtful, consensus candidate. as judge garland said in the rose garden on the day he was nominated: people must be confident that a judge's decisions are determined by the law and only the law. for a judge to be worthy of such trust, he or she must be faithful to the constitution, and to the statutes passed by congress. he or she must put aside his personal views or preferences and follow the law; not make it. fidelity to the constitution and the law has been the cornerstone of my professional life, and is the hallmark of the kind of judge i have tried to be for the past 18 years. these are not the words nor the track record of a judicial activist. in my opinion, this is the kind of judge that merrick garland has been: not a judicial activist but someone who recognizes the important role and the important balance between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. i am encouraged that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have at least begun to give judge garland the courtesy of a meeting, but meetings alone are not sufficient. the american people deserve the opportunity to hear judge garland's qualifications debated in a public hearing in the judiciary committee, and they deserve an up-or-down vote on the senate floor. that is all we ask. i again urge my colleagues to give judge garland the consideration other nominees have received. at the end of the day, if they choose to vote against him, that is their right, but the idea that somehow they are interpreting the constitution to say that in the last year of a presidency a qualified judge should not even receive consideration of a hearing and a vote is quite honestly beyond the pale. too often these debates end up going on and become extraordinarily complicated. in many ways, what i hear from virginians--regardless of whether they want me to support judge garland--is a very simple message: do your job. in the coming days and weeks, i hope the senate will do its job and give judge garland the consideration of a hearing before the judiciary committee and then take up this eminently qualified jurist's nomination on the floor and give him the vote he deserves. i yield the floor. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mrs. ernst). the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. merkley. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. paris climate agreement mr. merkley. madam president, i rise to recognize the importance of the signing of the paris agreement. tomorrow marks the 46th anniversary of earth day--the first earth day--the earth day that occurred when i was in seventh grade. my seventh grade teacher made a point of making sure all the students were aware of it. they made sure we had a chance to do a field trip to the community college to learn about some of the issues related to stewardship of the planet. it is a day to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of our blue-green planet but also to recognize, to remind ourselves of the fact that we have a huge responsibility to be good stewards of the wonderful planet we have. it was theodore roosevelt who said that ``our greatest central task [is] leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us.'' that is the definition of stewardship, and that is what earth day is all about. this is why it is so fitting that tomorrow, on earth day, america will join other nations in signing the paris agreement. this international climate accord is a tremendous step forward. it makes clear the world recognizes that global warming is a very significant and grave concern facing human civilization on this planet. it is, indeed, the moral challenge of our generation. i am proud and inspired by the global community's unprecedented commitment to avert global warming, to avert a climate crisis. we know what the stakes are. we don't need computer models to look 50 years into the future because the impacts are here today. we see it in our own communities. we see it in our own states. we see it through the impact of droughts, the impact of wildfires, the impact of heat waves, the storms, the hurricanes, the tornadoes. we see it through story after story of this year or this month being the warmest ever recorded by humans. these events have profound costs that can be measured in lost lives, lost homes, lost businesses, billions of dollars in disaster relief. it is important to understand that global warming's major assault is on our rural communities, on our farming, our fishing, and our forestry. you can see it across the world. you can see it across the country. you can see it just inside my home state of oregon. we have had significant droughts greatly impacting our agricultural community in my state. we have had a loss of snowpack in the cascades, a trend over decades impacting the availability of water for irrigation in farming. we have seen the impact on fishing, with streams that are warmer and smaller than they were in the past. we have seen it on our oyster population on the coast, where now the oysters are having trouble reproducing because the pacific ocean is 30 percent more acidic than it was before we started burning fossil fuels on this planet. that greater acidity is affecting the ability of baby oysters to form shells. that should frighten us all--the ability of shellfish to form shells being threatened. it is hard to imagine that we have burned enough fossil fuels to actually [[page s2367]] impact the acidity of the oceans. but we have, and the problem is getting worse. we see the impact on our forests. we see it in my home state of oregon through the red zone. that is the term given to the vast swaths of forests that have been killed by pine beetles because the winters now are not cold enough to kill off the pine beetle. so the infestations are much more aggressive, much more widespread. we see the impact on our forests from more vigorous wildfires and a longer forest fire season--a season that has grown by 60 days over 40 years. that is 2 months. in fact, we have even had forest fires in oregon in the month of january. it is a huge loss, a huge impact on the ecosystem, and a huge impact on the economy. if you care about rural america and our farming, our fishing, and our forestry, you must care about carbon pollution and global warming. scientists agree that we must keep the warming of our planet under 2 degrees celsius in order to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change--impacts much worse than what we are seeing now. but we have already warmed the planet by 1 degree. so we are halfway toward that boundary, which is why an important component of the paris agreement is not just the substance of the agreement itself but also a compact that the international community will revisit every 5 years, because the measures taken in the paris agreement are not enough to fend off catastrophe. what they do represent is virtually every nation in the world coming together and saying we understand the challenge to our planet, and we understand that we must be part of the solution. to have more heads of state come together in december for the paris agreement than at any other time in human history is very impressive. but the commitments made, even if they are fully fulfilled, don't go far enough. we are going to have to come back together every 5 years to add to our understanding and to increase the speed with which we are pivoting from fossil fuels to renewable fuels. at those 5-year gatherings, we will strengthen our pledges, we will work to reduce the emissions even further, and we will review the changing technologies. there is so much investment going on. there is a program called mission innovation, which is a number of countries coming together, private companies coming together, and foundations coming together to develop the best ideas--out-of-the-box ideas--to be able to take on the challenge of global warming. those technologies are going to be a key part of accelerating our ability to tackle this challenge. we have to keep working to drive down the cost curve on renewable energy so that it makes a positive contribution to our economy in every possible way, lowering the cost of power while at the same time putting thousands or, in some technologies, millions of individuals to work. we have to make sure developing countries can afford these options in solar, wind, and other renewable strategies. together, we must invest in paradigm-shifting technology. one of those might be battery storage, to make better use of solar energy when the solar energy exceeds current demand, or to capture wind energy when the wind is blowing strongly and our wind turbines are producing more than the current demand. it means we have to do things such as investing in a broader grid to ship those amps of electricity around the country--those watts of energy around the country. here at home, we can't keep up business as usual. if we need to pivot from fossil fuels to renewables, then we shouldn't keep subsidizing fossil fuels. we can't keep drilling oil offshore and opening up drilling in new places like the arctic. the arctic nation should come together and reach a pact not to drill in the arctic and to put it off-limits. as american citizens, you and i own a lot of oil, a lot of coal, and we must recognize that we need to keep those fossil fuels that we own in the ground because here is the size of the problem. for us to succeed in keeping the temperature of our planet below 2 degrees celsius above the pre-industrial age, we have to leave 80 percent of the identified proven fossil fuel reserves in the world in the ground. if we are going to do that, then it makes no sense at all--for what you and i own as citizens--to be pulling it out of the ground. it makes no sense to be doing contracts today--leases--that provide a legal contract for extraction of our coal, our oil, and our gas, which you and i own as citizens, three decades, four decades, or five decades into the future--long after the world has to have pivoted off of fossil fuels. it is said that when you are in a hole, stop digging. in this case, we are in a carbon pollution hole, and we need to stop digging fossil fuels out of the ground. instead, we must seize the opportunity to invest in the infrastructure of the future, to spur a clean energy revolution, and to build a green economy creating living-wage jobs. it has been said that we are the first generation to feel the impact of global warming, and we are the last generation that can do something about it. that is a huge responsibility. the signing of this agreement consists of doing something about it, something major about it, something important about it, something that all the nations in the world have come together to do together to take this on and to recognize our collective responsibility. it is a breakthrough moment in the fight-- the international fight, the human civilization fight--to take on this moral, major challenge to our planet. while this deal is by no means the end of the work we must do, having the global community come together around a vision of action is a huge milestone in the path to averting climate catastrophe. this agreement should only strengthen our nation's resolve to build a sustainable future, to protect our beautiful blue-green planet, and to work harder to fight climate change not just on earth day but every day of the year. in fact, this agreement is very much central to the task that theodore roosevelt put before us: to leave our land a better land for our descendants than it is for us. let's get to work. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. franken. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 3833 to amendment no. 3801 mr. franken. madam president, i call up my amendment no. 3833. the presiding officer. the clerk will report. the legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from minnesota, [mr. franken] proposes an amendment numbered 3833 to amendment no. 3801. the amendment is as follows: (purpose: to provide funding for the tribal energy loan guarantee program) on page 29, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following: tribal energy loan guarantee program for the cost of loan guarantees provided under section 2602(c) of the energy policy act of 1992 (25 u.s.c. 3502(c)), $8,500,000, to remain available until expended: provided, that the cost of those loan guarantees (including the costs of modifying loans, as applicable) shall be determined in accordance with section 502 of the congressional budget act of 1974 (2 u.s.c. 661a): provided further, that, for necessary administrative expenses to carry out that program, $500,000 is appropriated, to remain available until expended: provided further, that, of the subsidy amounts provided by section 1425 of the department of defense and full-year continuing appropriations act, 2011 (public law 112-10; 125 stat. 126), for the cost of loan guarantees for renewable energy or efficient end-use energy technologies under section 1703 of the energy policy act of 2005 (42 u.s.c. 16513), $9,000,000 is permanently canceled. mr. franken. madam president, federal programs in indian country are chronically underfunded. i have served on the indian affairs committee for the past 7 years, and i have been shocked by what i hear almost every week from tribal leaders about the challenges in indian country. tribes struggle with crumbling schools, dilapidated roads, lack of housing, and lack of basic infrastructure. many of the crises we hear about in indian country come from lack of opportunity, lack of hope. indian youth have the highest rate of suicide among all ethnic groups in the united states. suicide is the second-leading cause of death for native youth aged 15 to 24. the indian suicide rate is 62 percent higher than it is for [[page s2368]] the general population. unemployment on indian reservations averages 19 percent, and on some reservations it is above 50 percent. senators murkowski, heitkamp, and udall understand the dire needs of indian country, which is why they have cosponsored my amendment. chairman barrasso also understands the needs of indian country, and that is why he also supports this amendment. they understand that we have to support economic development for tribes whenever we can. my amendment sets aside $9 million, which can be leveraged into about $50 to $85 million worth of loans for energy projects in indian country. developing tribal energy resources will help tribes bring power to the most remote parts of indian country--improving access to reliable and resilient energy and providing much needed jobs. that is why congress authorized the loan program in the energy policy act of 2005--to help tribes access the capital they need for energy projects. but this program has never received funding. my amendment doesn't cost anything. we are simply putting $9 million of already-appropriated money toward a new use. i thank senators heitkamp, udall, and murkowski for cosponsoring my amendment. i thank chairman alexander and ranking member feinstein for their leadership. finally, i thank secretary moniz, who has been a champion for this program. i urge my colleagues to support franken amendment no. 3833 to bring jobs to indian country. the presiding officer. the senator from tennessee. mr. alexander. madam president, i thank senator franken for the way he worked with our committee. i will vote for the amendment, and i recommend that others do as well. the presiding officer. the question is on agreeing to amendment no. 3833. mr. alexander. madam president, i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second? there appears to be a sufficient second. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk called the roll. mr. cornyn. the following senators are necessarily absent: the senator from missouri (mr. blunt) and the senator from texas (mr. cruz). mr. reid. i announce that the senator from illinois (mr. durbin), the senator from connecticut (mr. murphy), and the senator from vermont (mr. sanders) are necessarily absent. the presiding officer (mr. hoeven). are there any other senators in the chamber desiring to vote? the result was announced---yeas 76, nays

adopted to the pending business--energy and water development and related agencies appropriations act, h.r. 2028. on rollcall vote no. 59, had i been present, i would have voted to support the amendment. senator franken's amendment will further strengthen the deployment of clean energy by creating a tribal energy loan guarantee program to fund energy projects in indian country. this amendment will help indian tribes access much needed financing as they seek to develop energy projects and create well-paying jobs. the presiding officer. the senator from maryland. ms. mikulski. mr. president, i rise as the vice chair of the appropriations committee to express my appreciation to the majority leader of the senate, senator mcconnell, and senator cochran, the chair of the appropriations committee, for moving the process forward. we have on the floor today the energy and water committee bill. this is the first bill of the appropriations committee to come to the floor. it signals that we are ready to do regular order. i so appreciate the leaderships' commitment to do that, so we don't end up with a big omnibus bill at the end. every bill comes, they can be amended, and everyone can have their day and their say. it is an excellent kickoff to what i hope will be the ability to move all 12 bills and some crucial, urgent supplementals. i also compliment senators alexander and senator feinstein for the excellent job they have done on this particular subcommittee. they have followed the bipartisan agreement. they have a bill that is free of poison pill riders. when you look at what they have done in terms of energy and water, it is an excellent bill from the standpoint of national security and economic development, whether it is the funding for the army corps of engineers that is so important to those of us who have ports, to science in terms of our fields of energy. we win nobel prizes, but we need to win the markets. it has an excellent approach in terms of tech transfer. maryland benefits from this bill. it provides over $100 million for the port of baltimore. that is going to support the port's nearly 14,000 jobs and a tax base of over $300 million. the port of baltimore has always been the gateway to ohio and the west. first, supported by the b&o--baltimore and ohio--railroad and now csx. funding in this bill dredges the port's 50-foot channel, making it ready for megacontainer ships coming through the expanded panama canal and supporting the port's competitive edge over its east coast competition. the bill also funds construction of poplar island, where clean dredge material is rebuilding the natural ecosystem of a former chesapeake bay island. this bill exceeds the target level for the harbor maintenance trust fund, providing approximately $1.3 billion. dredging is the primary activity of the trust fund. this funding is knocking out the nationwide backlog of dredging projects, supporting the u.s. economy and local economies. across maryland, this bill makes critical investments, protecting assateague island, a national seaside treasure, for future generations, protecting cumberland from flooding, and protecting this area's water supply at the jennings randolph lake in garrett county. this bill also supports a unique public-private partnership between the u.s. department of energy and commercial truck manufacturers. together, they are developing the next generation of fuel-efficient heavy-duty trucks. total funding is $20 million. volvo has been a partner and is competing again for a portion of this funding. its hagerstown, md plant produces mack trucks with 1,600 jobs. their talented professionals have been leaders on truck engine research and development, discovering technologies to reduce oil consumption and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. for the appalachian regional commission, this bill provides $75 million for the base program, an increase of $5 million. the commission meets both physical and human infrastructure needs. this is a hands- across-the-aisle program that all appalachia senators support. there are 13 states in the commission. [[page s2369]] maryland has three counties in the commission: washington, allegany, and garrett. maryland's mountain counties receive nearly $5 million annually, making investments to rebound from lost manufacturing jobs. the recession was another setback. now, through their community colleges, they are retraining and retooling their residents. the commission's grants, matched with local and other federal funding, are making a big difference. i recently visited garrett college where i announced two grants. the first was to establish new allied health programs with a simulation manikin. this was a grant award for $110,000. the second grant was to buy westernport a new water tank. this grant for $400,000 was matched with $2.4 million in other federal loans and grants. it means more capacity for westernport, new service to nearby towns of luke and bloomington, and a huge cost savings to luke mill. the paper mill has been supplying drinking water to the town of luke. this grant is protecting the 880 employees at luke mill and 3,000 regional jobs in timber and trucking. if this is the way it is going to be to move appropriations, i think it is a good day. it is not only a good bill, but it shows when the senate practices the ability to work together to bring legislation to the floor, to follow regular order, we can get our job done. it can be open, it can be transparent, and we can have amendments. i so look forward to this being the tone and the tempo of the rest of the appropriations season. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from arkansas. national park week mr. cotton. mr. president, this week i encourage arkansans and all americans to take a moment and enjoy your local national parks as we celebrate national park week 2016. this year national park week is particularly important because it also happens to be the 100th anniversary of the national park service, a milestone we will celebrate all year long. for those of you who don't know, our national park system began in 1872 with the establishment of yellowstone national park. the organization charged with managing these parks, the national park service, was established four decades later in 1916. today we have over 400 national parks and historic sites around the country, all full of wildlife, beautiful landscapes, and rich culture. these sites are all cared for by over 20,000 dedicated employees of the national park service, including park rangers who patrol our parks and keep visitors safe. arkansas is home to several national parks and national historic sites, some of the prettiest and most interesting in the country, in my opinion. for those of you who have not been to arkansas, i encourage you to visit hot springs national park to see our natural springs and thermal pools. if you are a history buff, you can visit arkansas post, the site of the only revolutionary war activity in the state of arkansas. if you are into the outdoors, you can float the buffalo river. the list goes on. each of the national parks and historic sites in arkansas and around the country has its own unique appeal and holds its own adventure. so happy national park week and happy 100th birthday to the national park service. i encourage everyone to take advantage of free admission to all national parks in arkansas and across the country through this sunday, april 24. have a little fun, learn a little bit about your great country, and show your support and thanks for the men and women who serve us in the national parks. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. hatch. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. hatch. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that i be permitted to complete this speech. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. corporate inversions mr. hatch. mr. president, over the past couple of years i have spoken numerous times on corporate inversions, the problems they cause, and various proposed solutions. i wish to take a few minutes today to comment on some of the recent developments with regard to this important issue. inversions are a matter of great concern in our country. this is true among members of both parties, both in and out of government. as the chairman of the senate's tax-writing committee, i have to say that for years now, most major discussions i have had on tax policy and reform with various private sector stakeholders eventually end up focusing on inversions. virtually everyone acknowledges that inversions are a problem. when a u.s. company reidentifies itself as a foreign entity and moves its tax headquarters overseas, it shrinks our tax base. it means lost investment and growth for our country and a further demonstration of the failure of the government to create a tax environment in this country that allows businesses to flourish, create jobs, and, of course, help grow our economy. as i said, members of both parties see inversions as a problem, one that needs fixing. sadly, the debate surrounding this national issue has too often become mired in politics and partisanship, which thus far has prevented congress from making any real progress. some in washington--in the capitol and on the other end of pennsylvania avenue--would rather talk about inversions than solve the problem. when a wave of u.s. companies announce that they are merging with other entities and moving their headquarters offshore, the strategy seems to be to publicly attack those companies; accuse them of, among other things, lacking ``economic patriotism''; and put forward unworkable policy proposals while labelling anyone opposing those proposals as somehow being in favor of or at least indifferent to inversions. most of the policy ideas that get put forward tend to be punitive and burdensome, with the goal, not of incentivizing companies to stay in the united states, but to forcibly prevent them from leaving. over the past year or so of political campaigning, we have heard a lot of talk about building walls and who will be made to pay for them. some are proposing that we build a literal physical wall to keep certain people from coming into the united states, with a supposedly clever plan to force other countries to pay for it. well, at the same time, most of the proposals we have seen to deal with inversions would amount to building a virtual wall--a wall forged in regulation and punitive tax treatment--around the country to keep companies from leaving and making every business in america and all of their employees and individual customers pay the cost. the latest wall-building exercise came earlier this month with treasury's temporary anti-inversion regulations and proposed regulations aimed at earnings stripping. of course, the administration's anti-inversion approach is essentially the regulatory equivalent of a doctor who wastes all of his time and energy treating a patient's symptoms one by one as they arise without making any effort to diagnose, let alone treat, the underlying illness. inversions are not in and of themselves a disease; they are merely symptoms of a much broader illness that will continue to infect our economy so long as we refuse to treat it. i won't keep you in suspense, mr. president. that illness is not a lack of proper regulation; it is an overly burdensome tax system and an environment that is, on the whole, unfriendly to american businesses. u.s. companies don't move their tax headquarters offshore because they like the weather in other countries. if that were the case, i don't think so many of them would be moving to ireland or the u.k. no. american companies invert because they face global competition, and our system forces them to compete on an uneven playing field with at least one, if not both arms tied behind their back. for example, we have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, and we have a tax code that effectively pays u.s. [[page s2370]] multinationals to keep their foreign earnings offshore and punishes them when they decide to bring capital back into the country. it is these factors--not a lack of appropriate regulation by the government or a shortage of ``economic patriotism'' on the part of american businesses--that make foreign countries more attractive destinations for american companies. if we want to prevent future inversions, we should spend less time tinkering around the regulatory edges and engaging in partisan rhetoric and more time trying to find common ground to actually fix our tax code. for the record, it isn't just inversions that are the problem. as i have noted repeatedly, even if the administration and congress found a way, through punitive and burdensome means, to block all inversions, our tax system would still make american companies even more attractive targets for foreign takeovers, which are every bit as problematic as inversions, if not more so, and much harder to address through a purely regulatory approach. foreign takeovers are already a problem. according to an ernst and young study released last year, the u.s. economy suffered a net loss of $179 billion--with a ``b''--in business and assets to foreign buyers in the decade between 2003 and 2013. the same study also found that a reduced corporate tax rate would have greatly reduced these losses, possibly eliminating them entirely. keep in mind that unlike most inversion transactions, u.s. management is almost always fired after a foreign takeover. other employees--local service providers and suppliers--are often targeted for elimination as well. sadly, many democrats in washington, both here in congress and in the administration, don't seem to grasp the full nature of this problem. they talk a great deal about inversions and the need to prevent them. because the picture of a big american company moving offshore to escape taxation is particularly distressing for populist audiences, they tend to ramp up that talk and couple it with ideas on how to punish inverters in even-numbered years. yet they have taken precious little action to fix the underlying problems that lead companies to want to invert in the first place. there was a glimmer of hope with the findings and recommendations of the finance committee's bipartisan international tax reform working group. however, as is far too often the case, that glimmer of hope may very well be overtaken by the politics of the moment. so instead of acknowledging that our tax system is the cause of the inversion problem, my friends on the other side have generally opted to put forward regulations that may very well be effective in curbing inversions in the short term but will do nothing to improve business conditions in the united states and could be in the order of causing companies to sell themselves to foreign buyers, which is what is happening. within days of the release of the treasury's latest regulations, pfizer, a major american drug company, announced it was backing out of its proposed inversion deal with allergan. many observers were quick to credit the obama administration for a supposed job well done while democratic candidates for president openly celebrated the fact that an american company chose to subject itself to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and penalties in order to avoid even greater losses as a result of these regulations. that is the kind of world we are living in--one where there is a willingness to demonize an iconic american company that employees tens of thousands of american workers and to cheer when it suffers massive losses. that is viewed as an affirmative qualification to be the democratic nominee for president. now, to be fair, i will acknowledge that, in addition to unveiling the proposed anti-inversion measures, the obama administration also laid out a basic framework for corporate tax reform. of course, this framework, which closely resembles similar proposals the president has included in past budgets, is woefully short on details. it is not a reform proposal with any serious potential for bipartisanship nor one with a detailed list of specific goals and objectives. it is more or less just a vaguely worded wish list of tax ideas they would like to see enacted at some point. the reaction from many sectors of the business community, including from ceos who more often than not support my friends on the other side, proves the point. we know, basically, that the president's version of international tax reform consists of a one-time mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings to be taxed at a rate designed not to maximize any benefit but to hit a revenue target for increased spending--in other words, so they can spend more money. this would be coupled with a high minimum tax on foreign earnings, also designed specifically for increased spending, not for significantly bringing down the statutory tax rate, which, after all, is one of the few ways you can really help our american companies. put simply, there is virtually nothing in the president's nebulous tax reform framework that would discourage companies from moving offshore. in fact, one could argue--and many have--that the president's proposed high minimum tax on foreign earnings would actually encourage more u.s. companies to invert. for example, this past november, the vice president of global taxes at procter & gamble, another iconic american company, was quoted as saying: ``if we take a step towards a [minimum] tax at the corporate level, we're exacerbating the problem; we're actually guaranteeing that inversions are more attractive.'' on top of these new taxes, there is no real effort in the president's tax framework to improve the business climate in the united states more generally. after all these changes, the framework would still leave the united states with a corporate tax that would be well above the average in the developed world, leaving us right where we have been. in short, this framework is par for the course with this administration. we have heard quite a bit of blame thrown in congress's direction for not acting to prevent inversions. what we haven't heard is any serious effort on the part of the president or anyone in his administration to engage with congress on meaningful tax reform. like i said, the president and his supporters are far more willing to assign blame for the problems caused by our tax system than to actually work toward a solution. this is particularly true in election years, when the motto seems to be this: why fix a problem when you can blame it on the other side? for my part, i am working to take specific steps to address these problems. i have been the republican leader on the senate committee on finance for about 4\1/2\ years now, and for 4\1/2\ years i have been calling on my colleagues and imploring officials in the administration to engage on tax reform. to date, i have seen little in the way of a meaningful response. currently, i am working on a relatively simple but potentially effective tax reform proposal that i believe will be bipartisan and many believe would relieve a great deal of the inversion pressure on american companies and, at the very least, significantly alter the economic calculation for inversion transactions. best of all, it would do so without punishing companies or imposing burdensome mandates. in short, my proposal would provide more carrots to keep companies from inverting and fewer sticks to punish companies that try to go in that direction. while i am still working with the joint committee on taxation to finalize the details of this proposal, the basic idea behind my proposal would be to streamline the taxation of business income and eliminate instances in which profits and earnings are subject to multiple layers of taxation at the company and shareholder levels. i will have more to say on this proposal in the coming weeks. today, i am simply trying to counter the narrative that american companies can and should be forced to remain in the united states by regulation. i am trying to demonstrate that you cannot fix the inversion problem by building a virtual wall around the country to keep businesses from leaving, while at the same time keeping tax rates so high that they have to leave to be able to compete. i am trying to show why you can't build that wall expecting some other [[page s2371]] country to pay for it. indeed, if an anti-inversion wall goes up without any real changes to improve the tax and business environment in the united states, it will be american workers and consumers that will end up footing the bill. what we are working on is corporate integration. right now the work we have done seems to be getting some positive feedback from the joint taxation committee, but they are not through with their work yet and so we are going to wait until they are. they should be through by the end of may, or at least that is what they have indicated will be their target. hopefully, they will have some preliminary results before the end of may. but let me say, if we are right on corporate integration, then both parties should come together to resolve these problems so that we can compete with any company anywhere in the world. i can just say, in short, that this program we are devising will allow the companies themselves to bring down their own tax rates without worrying about what the wonderful members of congress are going to do. at the same time, by bringing down those rates, they will be able to help this economy to go forward. so far this has been revenue positive. all we want for this program is to be revenue neutral. but i think we can get there, and i hope my friends on the other side will seriously look at this because this is something we could do this year to help this country resolve its problems with regard to corporate inversions. i believe it will work. i believe it will work. but a lot will depend on the joint taxation committee, and we will see what they are doing. so far the work they have done is positive. they have worked on it for a number of months now. they want to cover every possible ramification, and we are very appreciative of the work they are doing. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. rubio. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. cassidy). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. rubio. mr. president, today i filed two amendments very important to my home state of florida that i want to discuss. the first is an amendment that would authorize the central everglades planning project. the florida everglades are a national treasure. we have to work together to restore these lands. the state has experienced a wetter-than-average winter. the rains have elevated the levels of lake okeechobee which triggered the army corps of engineers to discharge billions of gallons of water to the east through the st. lucie river and to the west through the caloosahatchee river. these discharges have been ongoing for months and have negatively impacted the delicate ecosystem in the area as well as the agricultural and tourism industries. in order to diminish these discharges, we must authorize the central everglades planning project. once complete, this project will allow water to flow south from lake okeechobee to everglades national park and to florida bay. i had hoped this project would be authorized in 2014 by the administration, but the administration delayed the army corps of engineers' chief's report, which is the final step before congress can authorize new projects, but this year we have a real chance to get this done. thanks to the good work of chairman inhofe of the environment and public works committee, i expect the central everglades planning project to be included in the forthcoming water bill, which is slated to be marked up in committee next week. i will not ask for a vote on this amendment today, but i want to draw attention to this essential everglades restoration project. i am hopeful this body can come together to restore our everglades, but in the meantime i will continue to push for this vital authorization. mr. president, the other amendment i filed today, cosponsored by senators shelby, nelson, and sessions, also highlights the importance of water management. the issue at hand there involves water that is naturally supposed to flow south, but it has not done so due to the army corps' actions in and around the state of georgia. the results of this mismanagement have led to a 2013 department of commerce fishery disaster. it was declared for oysters in the apalachicola bay. during that same year, senator nelson and i held a field hearing in apalachicola, where we heard from local fishermen whose livelihoods and family traditions were injured by the collapse of these fisheries. while we must continue to explore ways to fish more sustainably, a large part of the fisheries' collapse was the lack of freshwater flows. i have long supported the role governors play in water allocation when the water in question greatly impacts multiple states. however, absent such an agreement between governors, water continues to be withheld, and the situation has now become dire in my home state of florida. the bottom line is, the status quo is only working for one state. i, along with the senior senator from florida and our colleagues from alabama, have stood lockstep to bring our respective states to the table to finalize water allocations that will take into account our shared goals. today we filed an amendment to do just that--to require the governors to agree on water allocation before the army corps of engineers can reallocate waters between the apalachicola-chattahoochee-flint river basin and the alabama-coosa-tallapoosa river basin. the amendment also stipulates no funds would be available for reallocation of water within the states if an agreement between the governors is not finalized. i urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure. eureka gardens mr. president, on a different matter, i want to take this moment to applaud the residents of eureka garden apartments in jacksonville, fl, for coming together as a community during a time of hardship. while they face dangerous living conditions and bureaucratic indifference to their concerns, they have remained united and resilient. the bottom line is, the federal government has failed them. the department of housing and urban development has for years certified a living facility that has put hundreds of families at risk. when hud inspected the property in question last summer, they passed the apartment complex, and they passed it with flying colors. eureka gardens received an 85 out of 100, but less than a month later, residents were complaining at tenants' association meetings and to their city council members about how bad their living conditions had become. when my staff visited the complex, what they witnessed was literally unbelievable. they saw crumbling stairs and black mold. they saw exposed electrical wiring that had been covered up by a trash bag. they smelled the natural gas that would soon hospitalize residents just days later. that was and that is unacceptable. my office, along with mayor curry of the city of jacksonville and the city council and the tenants association, pushed for months to have improvements and repairs done to this complex. in february, hud finally had a date by which all repairs must be completed. when they came back to reinspect eureka gardens, it passed the inspection, and they eventually renewed their contract with the property's owner, but the residents continued to say what they have been saying all along--hud's inspections weren't working. just recently, hud revealed that eureka gardens passed with a score of 62. the passing score is a 60. however, a senior hud official admitted that hud officials do not believe the property would currently pass another inspection. so hud has just admitted it has certified a failing facility. something is clearly wrong with the hud inspection process and floridians are being hurt because of it. i would like to read part of an article from the florida times-union, which was published on monday that quotes one of the residents at eureka gardens. dwan wilson, who said she has had to go to the hospital at least six times with asthma issues since the mold remediation, cried as she spoke about her apartments' problems. [[page s2372]] ``we thank you all for what you're trying to do,'' wilson said. ``we thank you all for pushing. but we're telling you they aren't doing anything.'' how many more years must the residents of eureka gardens suffer under this mismanagement? how many more children have to be put at risk due to lead poisoning and gas leaks? how many more facilities will hud continue to rubberstamp approval of only to further sell slumlike conditions for the most vulnerable tenants? how many taxpayer dollars will be wasted by this agency on failing projects such as this? these are the questions hud must answer. in the meantime, the residents of eureka gardens are forced to deal with the consequences of hud's failures. i will continue to look for solutions to make sure what has happened at eureka gardens isn't repeated elsewhere. americans deserve better from their government. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a letter i wrote to the secretary of hud, and it is dated april 18. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: u.s. senate, washington, dc, april 18, 2016. hon. secretary julian castro, u.s. department of housing and urban development, washington, dc. dear secretary castro: for over five months, my office has been involved in the investigation of shocking health and safety conditions at eureka garden apartments (eureka garden) in jacksonville, florida. it is appalling that american taxpayer dollars have been wastefully spent over the years to fund a facility that has repeatedly put hundreds of people and their families at risk. i am writing to highlight these many problems and to ask for the u.s. department of housing and urban development (hud) to conduct a thorough review of its inspection process. as you may know, following reports of code violations at the westside complex, my jacksonville staff toured eureka garden in early october 2015. they witnessed crumbling stairs disguised with duct-tape and covered with apparent black mold, faulty electric wiring covered with a garbage bag, and a distinguishable natural gas odor being sucked from an outdoor piping system into residents' air-conditioning, among other obvious health and safety issues. hud confirmed these conditions in an inspection of the property in october 2015, in which physical deficiencies were found in at least 340 of the 400 units. according to hud's own criteria, almost 50 of those deficiencies represented ``exigent health and safety concerns,'' including mold, water damage, exposed wires, carbon monoxide hazards and leaking gas pipes. despite these findings, just three months earlier in july 2015, hud gave eureka garden apartments an 85 out of 100 score in its real estate assessment center (reac) inspection. although many of the problems were witnessed during the summer inspection, hud representatives defended the passing score to my staff in a meeting last october, saying they did not contribute to the assessment of the property as they are not relevant criteria under hud's inspection process. had it not been for the residents calling attention to their dire situation, the facility would not have been reviewed again for another two years. your department recently notified my office that the most recent inspection of eureka garden gave the complex a reac score of 62 out 100, despite the many repairs that have been completed since the last reac inspection. this discrepancy indicates something is clearly wrong with the reac scores. your department visited eureka garden again on march 17th and 18th and witnessed what my staff and the city of jacksonville has seen all along--eureka garden remains in poor condition. after visiting eureka garden most recently, the deputy assistant secretary for multifamily housing wrote in a letter that ``hud officials do not believe the property would currently pass another reac inspection.'' however, hud's protocol has placed enough confidence in the previous inspection that it has renewed gmf's $6 million contract for eureka garden. in doing so, hud has knowingly certified a substandard facility because of a faulty inspection process. your department is ultimately responsible as the steward of the taxpayer funding that supports this property. therefore, to address these concerns, i respectfully request a timely response to the following questions: with conditions at eureka garden going unidentified for so long, what does hud plan to do about reforming its inspection process to identify problems earlier and to ensure passing grades are not given to failing properties? will hud explore a broader reform of inspection that expands the role of and resources available for state and local partners to regularly check the status of hud-certified facilities to ensure greater accountability? does the department plan a re-inspection of the complex? during this difficult time, i am proud of the eureka garden community for standing up and coming together on behalf of their vulnerable neighbors. this community has demonstrated great strength by collectively voicing their concerns and showing resiliency in the face of bureaucratic indifference and property mismanagement. it is time they are given the respect and quality of life they so deserve after waiting far too long for critical improvements to be made at eureka garden. thank you for your attention to this matter and continued work on this issue. i look forward to your prompt response. sincerely, marco rubio, u.s. senator. calling for the release of raif badawi and waleed abulkhair mr. president, one last item i want to discuss today, and i think it is appropriate, given where the president finds himself at this moment in saudi arabia. it is regarding a letter i sent earlier this week, along with senators durbin, risch, leahy, and johnson to president obama asking him to raise human rights issues during his meetings in saudi arabia--in particular, the case of raif badawi and his lawyer waleed abulkhair. raif badawi is a saudi blogger. he was arrested in 2012 on the charge of insulting islam and indicted on several charges, including apostasy. he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes. in january of 2015, raif received his first set of 50 lashes in public. this resulted in an international outcry. raif's subsequent lashes have been postponed. they have been postponed on health grounds. they have been postponed because just the first 50 lashes were so brutal, there were doubts whether he would survive 50 more, but he continues to serve his sentence in prison. last week i met with raif's wife to discuss his case. raif and his lawyer should be immediately and unconditionally released. while i deeply value and think it is a very important alliance between the united states and saudi arabia, this alliance cannot allow our country to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses. i hope we will take up this cause. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record our letter, dated april 19, 2016, that we wrote to the president. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: u.s. senate, washington, dc, april 19, 2016. hon. barack obama, the president, the white house washington, dc. dear mr. president: as you prepare for your upcoming trip to saudi arabia, we are writing to express concern regarding the government of saudi arabia's continued treatment of human rights advocates, particularly the documented prosecutions of non-violent activists who are engaging in freedom of expression. intolerance for freedom of speech and the imposition of travel bans and lengthy prison terms for peaceful dissidents harm saudi arabia's reputation internationally and stifle saudi innovation and creativity. we are concerned that unless you make these issues a priority during your trip, human rights abuses will continue to occur with impunity and the full potential of the u.s.-saudi relationship will continue to be impeded. specifically, we request you raise the case of blogger raif badawi, who was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes for launching a website that suggested a peaceful discussion about religion. mr. badawi endured a first round of 50 lashes in january of 2015 but the remainder of his lashes has been postponed due to his health condition. during his unjust imprisonment, mr. badawi has been a recipient of prestigious international awards such as the sakharov prize for freedom of thought. we are also concerned for the case of mr. badawi's lawyer, prominent human rights activist waleed abu al-khair, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison. additionally, we are concerned about the 2014 travel ban placed on mr. badawi's sister samar badawi, for her activism defending human rights. in 2012, ms. badawi received the u.s. state department's international women of courage award. in recent months, ms. badawi has been called in for questioning by security forces on several occasions and is subject to ongoing harassment. in your meeting with king salman, we urge you to advocate for the immediate and unconditional release of raif badawi and waleed abu al-khair. additionally, we urge you to request that ms. badawi's travel ban be lifted and ensure that she is not harassed further for her work. this is an important time for saudi arabia to play a leadership role in the region and the world by setting an example of religious tolerance and civility. we value the united states and saudi arabia close partnership and support efforts to [[page s2373]] find common approaches to addressing such critical issues as combating terrorism. however, true partners need to be able to have a frank dialogue about disagreements and areas of concern in our relationship. it is thus essential that the united states does not turn a blind eye to saudi arabia's human rights abuses. sincerely, marco rubio. james e. risch. ron johnson. richard j. durbin. patrick leahy. mr. rubio. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. peters. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. energy policy modernization bill mr. peters. mr. president, i rise today to discuss the bipartisan energy policy modernization act, which passed the senate yesterday with my strong support. this bill will help improve the energy efficiency of our buildings and appliances, saving michiganders money on their heating and electric bills by incentivizing weatherization and other activities. many of these cutting-edge building efficiency technologies, such as insulation and window sealing, are designed and developed in my great state of michigan. the bill also included a number of conservation provisions that will not only protect our environment, but they will boost our economy by supporting the $646 billion outdoor recreation industry. permanent authorizations of the land and water conservation fund and reauthorization of the north american wetland conservation act are just two examples that will protect wildlife habitat and improve access to public lands for all kinds of outdoor recreation. mr. president, i would also like to take a moment to focus on a bipartisan provision that i authored with my colleagues senator stabenow and senator alexander, the vehicle innovation act. this legislation will provide the tools that researchers, engineers, manufacturers, and others need to create the next generation of cars and trucks built in michigan and in states all across our country. southeast michigan is home to more engineers per capita than anywhere else in the country. we must ensure that our automakers, part suppliers, and other advanced manufacturers have the right tools to develop and incorporate new vehicle innovations that will improve safety, innovation, and vehicle performance in the cars and trucks of the future. exciting innovations are already underway. cars and trucks are being made with high-strength, light-weight materials that can improve fuel economy without compromising safety. improved combustion technologies can increase the efficiency of traditional engines while decreasing emissions. researchers are making batteries more affordable and recyclable while enhancing battery range and performance, making hybrids and electric vehicles even more competitive. the department of energy's vehicle technologies program is leading this effort, working with a wide range of partners, manufacturers, material suppliers, universities, energy suppliers, and our national laboratories. the department of energy's vehicle technology activities are authorized by a patchwork of different laws, and these authorities were last renewed almost a decade ago. a lot has changed in that time. vehicles today are wired with cutting-edge electronics and sensors. while my favorite part of detroit cars and trucks remains horsepower and torque, advances in onboard computers and new technologies are making our cars safer, more efficient, and more competitive globally. the peters-alexander-stabenow vehicle innovation act provides for a steady increase in funding for critical doe programs through the year 2020. this will create more certainty for companies and entrepreneurs engaged in public-private partnerships and ensure that critical research and development can keep up as technologies continue to emerge. our bill also establishes a clean authorization for doe's advanced vehicle technology activities. this will improve collaboration with light-duty automobile and medium- and heavy-duty commercial truck engineers, manufacturers, and suppliers to conduct cutting-edge technology-neutral research that will improve fuel economy and minimize fossil fuel use. with over 256 million vehicles on our roads, it takes decades of sustained effort to turn over our fleet. it is absolutely critical that we continue developing these advanced technologies here in the united states in order to achieve major fuel savings in the future and become truly energy independent. the vehicle innovation act has support from major manufacturers, labor, and environmental groups. this is something that just makes sense. i appreciate the support of senators murkowski and cantwell and all my colleagues who supported including this legislation in the bipartisan energy package. while i was pleased to see this commonsense measure included, i continue to be frustrated and disappointed that this body has held up an up-or-down vote on a bipartisan package authored by senator stabenow and me to help the people of flint, mi. flint is still in crisis mode as families still do not have safe, reliable water flowing from their taps. senator stabenow and i will continue pursuing all paths to fight for the assistance that the people of flint deserve. we will not give up. we remain fully committed to delivering to flint families the assistance they need to be able to use their tap water for bathing, cooking, and drinking without the fear that it may harm them or their children. i know that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are willing and able to join us in our efforts to help flint. i urge them to continue working with us to pass this package through the senate as soon as possible. the people of flint cannot wait any longer. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from iowa. judiciary committee investigations mr. grassley. mr. president, i wish to take this time to respond to senator reid's juvenile attacks on my judiciary committee's investigations and to senator reid's frequent crying about my previous state department holds. over the past several months, senator reid has been obsessed with mentioning holds on nominees--holds which i no longer have. holds are often necessary to force the executive branch to comply with congressional investigations. if you want proof of that, just ask the obama administration. in a federal court filing during the fast and furious litigation, the obama administration argued that the court should not even consider that particular case. the justice department's brief said courts should not enforce subpoenas at all. instead, the justice department reasoned that congress should use other powers to get documents. here is exactly what the government brief said: ``among other powers, congress can withhold funds from the executive branch, override vetoes, decline to enact legislation, refuse to act on nominations, and adjourn.'' later in the brief, the obama administration specifically suggested that congress can ``tie up nominations'' in order to get documents. if the administration can say that, why would senator reid think that is a wrong act for congress to take? it is this simple: if the minority leader doesn't like senators using holds to get documents from agencies, perhaps senator reid should talk to his friends in the obama administration who suggested that in the first place. in addition, senator reid shows his hypocrisy since members on his own side have held up obama nominees, and senator reid never said a peep about democrats exercising their rights. further, senator reid's attempts to politicize the judiciary committee's oversight work are very uninformed and result in misguided statements, and senator reid's accusation that taxpayer money is being wasted by engaging in oversight of the executive branch rings hollow. secretary clinton's nongovernment server and private email arrangements effectively walled off her official communications from the normal freedom [[page s2374]] of information act and other federal recordkeeping requirements. so to senator reid, i say: the freedom of information act is squarely within the jurisdiction of the judiciary committee and subject to oversight. the former secretary's use of a secret, private server to conduct all of her official business led to an avalanche of freedom of information act litigation. it also caused inaccurate responses to freedom of information act requests. for example, in december 2012, citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington submitted a freedom of information act request for records of secretary clinton's email addresses. the department responded by stating: ``no records responsive to your request were located.'' that response is very misleading, at best. senior department officials knew about secretary clinton's use of private email for official correspondence since they were sending emails to her nongovernment email address. they would have known instantly of records responsive to that request that the citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington submitted. yet those senior officials apparently failed to communicate with the state department's freedom of information act office. even then, if state's foia office were to search secretary clinton's government email account, they would find nothing since she operated a private account not subject to freedom of information. separate from her email address, secretary clinton's nongovernment server was a secret to high-level officials at the state department who were responsible for information technology and security. these officials had no idea the secretary was operating a separate unofficial system. she did not get their approval to do so, so how would they know? the judiciary committee has interviewed the chief information officer, the former chief information officer, the former deputy chief information officer, and the director of diplomatic security at the state department. the chief information officers oversaw the work of the information technology staffer who secretary clinton secretly paid to maintain her nonpublic server, yet all of these people knew nothing about that nonpublic server. that staffer didn't ask permission to have outside employment. while working at the state department, he didn't disclose his outside income on his financial disclosure forms. now, think about that. officials whose job it is to know were kept in the dark about this ``home brew'' email server. if a government agency hopes to be transparent with the american people--and that is the point behind the freedom of information act legislation--it must first be transparent with itself. now we know that highly classified material was transmitted to and stored on secretary clinton's secret server. what is important about that is this is an issue of national security. state department diplomatic security personnel have informed the judiciary committee that they were unaware of secretary clinton's using a nongovernment server for official business. so how, then, could they possibly secure it from security threats? now, the fbi is investigating this matter as well as several other investigations. we keep hearing that the fbi's inquiry is just a security review and not a criminal inquiry. so let me tackle that. however, one witness asserted his fifth amendment right against self- incrimination rather than answer questions about his work on secretary clinton's secret server. and he is relying on the fifth amendment to withhold his personal emails as well. recently, the department of justice granted him immunity. so, quite naturally, we are searching for other ways to get information before deciding whether it might be appropriate to seek an immunity order for his testimony. now, to senator reid: these are legitimate oversight inquiries for the judiciary committee. further, secretary clinton did not turn over all of her official emails. emails between gen david petraeus and secretary clinton, which secretary clinton failed to provide to the state department, were later turned over to the defense department. secretary clinton also failed to turn over emails with sydney blumenthal, whom secretary clinton views as an off-the-books intelligence resource, while secretary of state. if secretary clinton had used a government email address for official emails, we wouldn't have this problem in the first place. so how many more official emails were not turned over but should have been? the judiciary committee cannot ignore these important issues simply because the former secretary decided to run for president. and to be perfectly clear, i started this investigation before secretary clinton announced her candidacy. senator reid suggested that the committee's work on these issues is a waste of money. senator reid, that is nonsense. congressional oversight is not a waste of money; it is a constitutional responsibility. the minority leader fails to understand that congress is obligated to oversee that the executive branch of government faithfully executes the laws and faithfully spends the money the way congress intended. without such constitutional oversight, congress will not know if there are failures in the executive branch's duty to faithfully execute the laws that we pass. but do my colleagues know what is a real waste of money? this administration fought tooth and nail in the courts against congress for more than 4 years. why? just to avoid disclosing documents in the fast and furious scandal that they eventually turned over. that is a waste of money--a 4-year waste of money. the obama administration has fought against the press and watchdog organizations for years in the freedom of information act litigation over former secretary clinton's email records. senator reid, that is a waste of money. it is shocking that the obama justice department devotes so much taxpayer resources to avoiding the very transparency that president obama promised on january 21, 2009--1 day into office. this administration was going to be the most transparent in the history of the entire country, and it has turned out to be the most stonewalling. none of that would be necessary if the administration would just comply with congressional subpoenas and the freedom of information act. that is the way to save money. by the way, i would like to ask how much taxpayers' money does senator reid spend having his staff write daily speeches trying to undermine the work of the judiciary committee. senator reid also fails to understand that we are not only focused on secretary clinton. the committee is conducting dozens of investigations on a broad range of issues under the jurisdiction of the committee. some of the executive branch agencies have complained about the amount of oversight work the committee does on other matters. to justify my statements for this part of my remarks, i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record two letters. the first is from the department of homeland security, and the second is from the department of justice. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: u.s. department of homeland security, washington, dc, november 18, 2015. hon. charles e. grassley, u.s. senate, washington, dc. dear chairman grassley: since i became secretary of homeland secretary almost two years ago, i have worked to make the department more responsive to congressional correspondence, directives, request for reports, briefings and hearings, and other requests for documents and information. given that some 108 committees and subcommittees of congress (depending on how you count) assert oversight jurisdiction over this department, this is a full-time, time consuming task. we have also participated in about 100 hearings and over 2000 non-hearing engagements with congressional members and staff since the beginning of the 114th congress. members on both sides of the aisle have acknowledged our increased responsiveness. so far in 2015, i have received 46 letters from you alone-- almost one per week. i know because i read them all. many of these letters request reams of information, data, and documents that take hundreds of hours and dozens of staff to compile. we work diligently to respond to your letters promptly, but there is a huge cost to this. [[page s2375]] senator, i ask for your help in focusing and prioritizing these oversight letters. i want to continue to be responsive to your requests, and i want to do so as quickly as possible. at the same time, i must ensure that my staff remains focused on all our other priorities. i welcome the opportunity to discuss with you. sincerely, jeh charles johnson. ____ u.s. department of justice, office of legislative affairs, washington, dc, september 18, 2015. hon. charles e. grassley, chairman, committee on the judiciary, u.s. senate, washington, dc. dear mr. chairman: this responds to your letters to the attorney general, dated june 12, 2015, july 10, 2015, august 13, 2015, september 14, 2015, and september 15, 2015, regarding the executive office for immigration review (eoir). the department of justice (the department) has provided responses in our letters of august 14, 2015, august 25, 2015, and september 11, 2015. as noted in those letters and discussed with your staff, we continue to collect and review information, including the information noted in your letters, so we may provide a complete and thorough response to all of your inquiries as expeditiously as possible. we will continue to keep an open line of communication with your staff as we work toward additional responses to your questions. the department takes these issues seriously, and we thank you for bringing them to our attention. as you know, this year the department has received from your office almost 100 letters containing more than 825 questions and document requests, including the five letters received to date on this matter. while we have made and will continue to make all reasonable efforts to meet your stated deadlines, our ability to respond in a timely manner to your inquiries is impacted by the significant volume of letters we receive. we hope this information is helpful. please do not hesitate to contact this office if we may provide additional assistance regarding this or any other matter. sincerely, peter j. kadzik, assistant attorney general. mr. grassley. mr. president, both of the letters note the many dozen letters and hundreds of requests that i have sent, and both essentially complain about the volume of our investigation and requests for information. the judiciary committee is hard at work doing the people's business, and the committee is doing much more than just oversight. the committee has reported 16 executive nominees and 37 judicial nominees. it has processed 27 bipartisan bills out of committee, and every bill that has come out of committee is a bipartisan bill. eighteen of those bills were passed out of the senate over to the house, eight of which have been signed into law by the president. just last week, the committee unanimously adopted bipartisan legislation to finally protect fbi whistleblowers who report wrongdoing to their supervisors and provide for independent review of fbi whistleblower cases for the first time. so reviewing that record, it seems to me we can ask senator reid to justify his claim that this committee is partisan. the committee concluded an investigation into the abuse and misuse of paid administrative leave. the committee took the results and worked hard with members on both sides of the aisle to actually fix that problem. in february, the homeland security and governmental affairs committee approved the bipartisan, commonsense reforms in the administrative leave act of 2016. similarly, the committee has worked with democrats and republicans alike to overturn an office of legal counsel opinion that allows the agencies across government to stonewall their inspectors general. now let me tell my colleagues how senator reid is involved in stonewalling that effort. we came up with a legislative solution called the ig empowerment act and attempted to pass it in december by a live unanimous consent request. but senator reid objected to the bill even though it is supported by seven members of his own caucus and supported by the new york times editorial board and a host of civil liberties and good-government groups. even the largest circulating daily newspaper in the home state of senator reid urged him to work with us on a compromise. but rather than engaging us in a productive and civil manner, senator reid publicly slandered the bill as a legislative overreach. he claimed that he was concerned about a provision that allowed inspectors general to issue testimonial subpoenas to fight waste, fraud, and abuse. in fact, senator reid voted--senator reid actually voted--to give the exact same authority to the office of special counsel in 1989. that 1989 bill passed the senate unanimously and is now law. senator reid, was that legislative overreach when you did it? like that bill, the ig empowerment act has near unanimous support and is designed to root out wrongdoing from government, while ensuring proper safeguards of the use of subpoenas. so there is no reason to object to this bill on policy grounds. yet senator reid stands in the way of getting that done. the judiciary committee will continue its work. i say that to just one senator: senator reid. and during the course of my oversight work, i will use every tool at my disposal to obtain answers for the american people. so, senator reid, i will keep faith with my oath of office and ``we the people.'' i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from delaware. oklahoma city bombing anniversary and nomination of merrick garland mr. carper. mr. president, 21 years ago this week, the families of 168 people--19 of those 168 people children--received some of the worst news of their lives. that news was that a beloved member of each of their families had been killed in the bombing of the federal building in oklahoma city. we all watched the news that day, that night, the next day, and that week and beyond, as we took in the devastation caused by that blast. that horrible crime was carried out by a radical, anti-government extremist. it remains the deadliest act of homegrown terrorism in our nation's history. for the families who lost a loved one that day in 1995, there is no way to fill the void left by a life taken too soon, but i know that our government's pursuit of justice for the lives lost that day serve as a small source of comfort for the people who were left in mourning. at the time of that heinous crime, judge merrick garland, president obama's nominee to fill the vacancy on the supreme court, was the principal associate deputy attorney general at the u.s. department of justice. he immediately flew to oklahoma city to lead the criminal investigation and supervise the prosecution of the bombers. in fact, he insisted on being sent. he didn't just volunteer. he didn't just say: well, ok, i will go. he told his supervisors they had to let him go. he was the highest ranking justice department official on the ground in oklahoma city following the bombing. he helped oversee every aspect of the investigation and the subsequent trial. his colleagues at the time have attested to judge garland's commitment to following the letter of the law in every aspect of that investigation. he refused to take any shortcuts that could somehow compromise the integrity of the case that he and his team were building. through their tireless efforts, his tireless leadership, his deep understanding of the law, and scrupulous attention to detail, judge garland ensured the prosecution had an airtight case. ultimately, both bombers were convicted, giving the families of the 168 victims not their sons, their daughters, their children, their moms or dads back again, but at least providing a small measure of vindication for the losses they had incurred. judge garland's work was so appreciated by the families and friends of those victims 21 years ago that last year, on the 20th anniversary of the bombing, the oklahoma city national memorial & museum awarded judge garland its annual reflections of hope distinction--not the year after the bombing but 20 years after the bombing. judge garland has established an unparalleled reputation as a brilliant, dedicated prosecutor and jurist. he has received strong bipartisan support in the legal community, including from alberto gonzales, the former u.s. attorney general and white house counsel in the administration of president george w. bush. so today it is not just discouraging that most of my republican colleagues are refusing to consider judge garland's nomination to serve on our highest court; personally, i believe it is outrageous. [[page s2376]] i served for 8 years as governor of delaware, a state that is renowned for its own courts--supreme court, court of chancery, superior court--courts that play a national role, not just on a state level. as governor of my state for 8 years, i nominated men and women to serve on those courts. in every one of those nominations there were hearings held, whether they were democrat or republican. i think during that period of time i nominated an equal number of democrats and republicans to the judiciary. that is the constitution of our state, and, frankly, that is a great example because in delaware we have one of the highest regarded judiciaries. my obligation as governor was to nominate outstanding candidates for these judgeships as they became vacant. the role of the state senate in delaware was to consider them. they never waited a year and left a seat vacant for a year awaiting the end of my time as governor or any other governor's time. that would never happen. we wouldn't waste 10 months. state senators in our state wouldn't wait 10 weeks. they did their jobs. they did their jobs. we are not doing ours, and we need to. the fact that we haven't is outrageous. when we elect presidents to this country, we elect them for 4 years, and if they are reelected, then it is for another 4 years. they are not presidents for 3 years and 11 months; they are not elected to a term of 3 years and 10 months. we elect them to a term of 4 years. they need to be on the job for 4 years. our president is doing what he is supposed to do, and that is sending us the names of exceptional people who serve in incredibly important positions like the supreme court. he has done his job. i very much want to do mine, and i want to be joined by democrats and republicans in doing our jobs. every member of this body has taken at least one oath to uphold the constitution--some of us, many times over. at 17 years old, not much older than the young interns who are sitting here in the chamber, i took my first oath as a midshipman. i was a freshman at the ohio state navy rotc, where i was privileged to go on a navy scholarship. four years later, i took another oath and raised my right hand as an ensign in the navy. i took an oath to defend the constitution and the country and headed to pensacola, fl, to become a naval flight officer right in the middle of the vietnam war. i ended up serving three tours over there during that conflict. as a congressman, i took an oath to defend the country and constitution. as governor, i also took a similar oath to defend our country's constitution--at least to defend our state's constitution. then, as a u.s. senator i have taken an oath any number of times. i am regarded by my colleagues as one of the least partisan people here, but i think the refusal of the majority to even consider this nomination is more than an abdication of our responsibility. i believe it is an example of playing politics with the very constitution we have sworn to uphold. for those who don't know, delaware is known as the first state. we are known as the first state because on december 7, 1787, before any other state had ratified the constitution, we did. i joke with people that for 1 week delaware was the entire united states of america. we opened things up and let in maryland; we let in pennsylvania and new jersey and eventually louisiana--even iowa. i think for the most part it has turned out pretty well, but the idea of playing politics with the constitution that we have sworn to uphold is deeply troubling to me. i hope that is not what is going on here, but i fear that it is. the right and just way to proceed is to begin consideration of judge garland's nomination, not next month and not some other year, but now-- first in committee and then on the senate floor. we have something we call the delaware way. we are focused on the three c's--communicate, compromise, and collaborate. that is a good example for 49 other states, and i think it is a good example right here. after all, we have been sent by the people to this hallowed place, this senate chamber, to put democracy into action, to protect liberty and to protect justice for all. nearly 50 years ago, former chief justice warren burger, a conservative--i believe he was from california and was appointed or nominated by dwight eisenhower, a republican. former chief justice warren burger said, ``a sense of confidence in the courts is essential to maintain the fabric of ordered liberty for a free people.'' he went on to say that ``inefficiency and delay will drain even a just judgment of its value.'' i think the shorthand version of that is justice delayed is justice denied. justice delayed is justice denied. by dragging our feet and trying to get into a new congress, maybe with a new president--certainly, with a new president--that is delaying justice, i believe. in the face of the prospect of any number of potentially 4-to-4 divided verdicts in the supreme court with only eight members, we cannot just stand aside and let that happen. justice burger was right when he said those words all those years ago, and he is right today. mr. president, i think it is time to stop this delay. it is time for us to serve the people. it is time for us to deliver justice. it is time for us to give this president's nominee the consideration demanded of us by the constitution, which we are sworn to uphold. mr. president, i see no colleague seeking recognition, and with that i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. ms. klobuchar. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. remembering prince ms. klobuchar. mr. president, i come to the senate floor today to speak of the loss of the one of minnesota's own, and that is prince. like all minnesotans, today we were shocked and saddened. i grew up with prince's music, starting with ``little red corvette'' in the seventies and eighties. we won't forget ``purple rain'' in minnesota. we were so proud of that movie, and everyone would point at every spot in the movie they knew from growing up. he was a superstar, composer, amazing performer, and a music innovator with a fierce belief in the independence of his art. he lived his art. he believed his words were his own, his name was his own, and he wasn't going to let anyone own him. there was absolutely nobody like him, and there never will be. prince sold more than 100 million records worldwide. he released 39 studio albums. he had five no. 1 billboard hits and 40 in the top 100. he won seven grammys, an oscar, and a golden globe. he was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 2004, the first year he was eligible. but even with all that success, even with all that fame, minnesota never lost that sense that he was a beloved son--our neighbor, the superstar next door. i was always so proud to say: ``prince--you know he's from minnesota.'' he was born there, and he still lives there. the fact that prince was a proud native of my state came through in all of his music. he pioneered the minneapolis sound--that mixture of funk, rock, and pop that emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s and influenced music for decades to come. jimmy jam and terry lewis, janet jackson, bruno mars, mark ronson, justin timberlake, the weeknd, beyonce--these are just some of the many artists who were influenced by that sound. but that sound didn't just influence artists, it influenced everyone who heard it. prince's music touched our hearts, opened our minds, and made us want to dance. that is his legacy, and that is what we will always remember. prince made ``purple rain'' a household name. like most minnesotans, i remember the first time i listened to that album. it was, as his band was then called, a revolution. it changed music forever and is considered among the best in music history. two of the songs on that album--``when doves cry,'' which is especially notable because he plays all of the instruments in the song, and ``let's go crazy''--rose to the top of the charts. [[page s2377]] ``let's go crazy'' includes a lesson important to remember on days like today. there is a world waiting for us after this life, prince sang, ``a world of never ending happiness, where you can always see the sun, day or night.'' i know that today all of us hope prince is standing in that sun. prince sang that song at first avenue--the venue in downtown minneapolis--when he introduced his band to the city in 1983. there, too, prince shot some of the scenes for his classic ``purple rain'' film. today the club is a landmark and a must-play venue for some of the best artists. i personally stood in prince's dressing room surrounded by pictures of him. the building is covered in stars with the names of artists who have performed there, and there will always be one star that will shine the brightest, and that is the man who made it the landmark it is--prince. minnesota loves prince, and prince loved minnesota. he was born in minneapolis. he went to central high school, where he played piano and guitar for a band called grand central. he recorded his early demo tapes with chris moon and at sound 80 studios in minneapolis. throughout his life, he called minnesota home. he wrote a song about the minnesota vikings--he was always a big fan--appropriately titled ``purple and gold.'' at the end of last year when the minnesota lynx--our women's basketball team--won the wnba championship, he held a concert at his recording studio, paisley park, for local fans, who got to enjoy his music well into the night. just a few days ago, he hosted a dance party there and made a brief appearance. in some way, it was his last gift to our state. but his best and lasting gift? his music, his innovation, his energy. when accepting bet's lifetime achievement award, prince said: the future's in your hands now. and the world really is yours. well, that world is a whole lot cooler because prince was in it, and it is a whole lot sadder today now that he is gone. my heart goes out to his friends and family and to all who mourn his loss today. we will miss the artist prince. i yield the floor. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. paris climate agreement mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i am on the floor i guess just a few moments ahead of the ranking member of our senate foreign relations committee, my friend ben cardin, who is on his way but has authorized me to proceed with a few remarks on the topic that he and i, and perhaps others, would like to address, which is tomorrow's signing in new york of the paris climate agreement. over 160 nations around the world are going to be participating in signing that agreement that will move many of them immediately into their program of compliance and signify for others a statement of intention to join. i think it is the largest international agreement, in terms of the number of countries involved, ever, certainly the biggest one i can think of. so it is very significant in that respect. one other thing about paris that i think was also very significant is what took place in america's corporate sector in support of a strong paris agreement. the president and groups like ceres, with particular leadership from companies like unilever, got together and created a remarkable american corporate coalition with more than 150 companies, including ones like bank of america and goldman sachs, ford and gm, nike, and vf industries, general mills, cargill, apple, google--a terrific coalition; kind of the who's who of corporate america. they got together to urge the countries of the world to be bold in paris, to have it be a strong agreement, and to show their support for an international program to address climate change, which i think is terrific. the distinguished junior senator from louisiana is presiding, and i can't think off the top of my head what louisiana-based companies are part of that coalition, but certainly companies that are based in virtually every state we represent in the senate--major companies: walmart, for instance, out of arkansas; coca-cola, out of georgia; vf industries, out of north carolina; some of our biggest electric utilities; the bulk of the property casualty insurance and reinsurance industry. it is very significant that america's corporate community came so strongly together. i hope very much that is a message that not only resonated in paris but that will resonate in congress as well because i would bet that every single one of us have a significant home state corporation that has signed that pledge, and some of us will have many significant home state corporations that will have signed that pledge. so when you have gotten to the point where the leadership of america's corporate community has signed on to the fact that something needs to be done and that america ought to lead--that is our role in the world--that will begin more and more to have an effect in this body to counter some of the nonsense and mischief that a very small slice in the fossil fuel industry has been propagating at the expense of the broader american corporate community, which, by and large, has been pretty outstanding on this. let me also mention one other thing that has happened just this afternoon, which i am very encouraged by; that is, an amendment that has been filed by 10 senators--bipartisan, 5 and 5. it is the graham- whitehouse amendment. the cosponsors on the republican side are senators graham, kirk, ayotte, collins, and portman. on the democratic side, they are whitehouse, merkley, schatz, markey, and brown. the amendment reads: climate change is real, and human activity contributes to climate change. climate change is already affecting the american people and poses an increasing risk to our health, security, economy, and infrastructure. over 180 nations, including china, india, and brazil, have made commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, creating opportunities for american workers and innovative private industry benefits from global clean energy markets. therefore, it is the sense of the senate that the united states should be a world leader in addressing climate change; that congress is best positioned to address policies that leave a prosperous economy and healthy environment for future generations; that congress has a responsibility to take actions that reduce emissions and combat climate change; and, finally, that congress should support research and development to bolster clean energy technology. in that latter regard, let me note the mission innovation initiative that has come out of secretary moniz's department of energy and out of a significant group of major investors around the world. the deal basically is that countries involved will try to double our clean energy r&d, and in return these major investors from around the world, led by bill gates, will set up a significant fund that will take the emerging technologies that early r&d can discover and bring them through the various early investment stages of what investors and startup folks call the valleys of death on the way to becoming a sustainable company so those technologies can be brought forward on an accelerated basis. so when you look at paris, you not only see this enormous array of nations coming together in a common cause, you see right behind it virtually the entirety of the leadership of america's corporate sector coming right in with it and saying: this is what we want. this is what we encourage. we want it to be strong. you have the biggest investors in the world, most of them coming together and saying: we are going to have your back with investment into new types of clean energy funding. and then you have the governments of the world not only signing up for--not all of them but the ones participating in mission innovation-- signing up, in addition to the treaty, for this commitment to increase r&d and press innovation in this space forward. so for all those reasons and more, tomorrow is a good news day for our country. it is a good news day for [[page s2378]] progress and innovation, it is a good news day for the enormous array of american corporate leaders who have supported and cheered on this particular occasion, and i think it is an occasion for pride on the part of the united states of america that the signing will be taking place in the united states in new york, that secretary kerry will be attending, that the chinese leader will be attending, and that people from all around the world will be there not only recognizing the need to do this but recognizing america's leadership in getting us to this place. i will close with a personal note of appreciation for a gentleman named todd stern. todd was the climate negotiator for the department of state for many years, and some of those were rather bleak years in which the united states was not showing leadership. so todd had to hang in there and endure that frustration and keep his candle of faith burning until the day came when we finally began to kick in at last. his role was very important in getting us prepared for and through the paris agreement. he is retiring and has served his country well. so i will close with a word of good will for that particular public servant who has done right by his duty and done right by his country. with that, i yield the floor, and with any luck, we can await the arrival of senator cardin in due course. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. franken. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. remembering prince mr. franken. mr. president, before i begin my remarks today regarding climate change, i wish to say a few words about a minnesota icon who passed away today. prince was a phenomenal artist who was beloved by people all over the world, but as minnesotans, we are particularly proud to call him one of our own. prince got his start in a minneapolis jazz band and went on to share his talent throughout minnesota and all over the globe. his artistry, his innovation, and his unparalleled presence inspired and will continue to inspire millions of people. in minneapolis, he put one of our most cherished venues, first avenue, on the map. up until just a few days ago, he was still performing, having held a concert in atlanta. he is truly going to be missed. someone once said: a brain isn't a mind, and a mind isn't a soul, and that is why we need the artists. i think the outpouring of appreciation we are seeing today for prince has to do with that unique role artists play, and it speaks to the importance of the arts and to human beings. paris climate agreement mr. president, i rise today to join my colleagues in celebrating the official signing of the paris climate agreement. tomorrow, more than 160 countries will send representatives to new york to sign onto this historic agreement. this gathering is set to become the most well-attended signing event in the history of the united nations--highlighting the importance of this issue for people around the entire world. i think it is very fitting that this event is taking place on earth day. this agreement has been nearly 25 years in the making. international climate efforts date back to 1992, when governments met in rio with the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations. nations have met every year since then to further this goal. while some meetings have been more successful than others, most have been met with disappointment and lack of action. after all, climate change is a complex issue, and achieving consensus for any international issue is no small fete, which is why this agreement is truly, truly impressive. last december, i traveled to paris with nine of my colleagues. we met with united nations secretary general ban ki-moon, with u.s. energy secretary ernest moniz, and with our then top climate change negotiator todd stern. i would like to congratulate all of them for their stellar work. i would also like to thank todd stern for his service at the state department and his dedication to combating climate change. mr. stern played a critical role in achieving a successful resolution in paris, and i have no doubt that his successor, dr. jonathan pershing, will effectively continue his work. climate change is an existential threat to our planet and to future generations. my colleagues have been on the floor of the senate today to talk about the impacts of climate change on their states and the need to address it. so i wish to take a minute to talk about how it is going to impact minnesota. minnesota is one of the top producing agricultural states in the country, where one out of five jobs is tied to agriculture. climate change will have significant impact on our food system, both through warmer temperatures and more intense droughts. a recent study estimates that global crop production could decrease by more than 40 percent by the end of the century. that is why i joined dave maclennan, the ceo of cargill--the largest privately owned company in the country--in penning an op-ed in the minneapolis startribune to highlight this threat, especially considering that the global population will reach 9 billion by midcentury. as the ceo of a company focused on agriculture, david is concerned about what climate change is going to do to our food supply. climate change will also impact our waters. minnesota is the land of 10,000 lakes. actually, it is about 14,000 lakes, including lake superior, which contains about 10 percent of the world's fresh surface water. lake superior has about 10 percent of the fresh surface water on earth. lake superior is warming by 2 degrees per decade. we are seeing more evaporation and lower water levels in the lake. plus, rising temperatures allow for more favorable conditions for invasive species and hazardous algal blooms. warmer temperatures could also have severe consequences to fish like walleye and trout, which are so important to minnesota fisheries and to our ecosystems. let's not forget the threat of climate change to our forests. like our lakes, warmer temperatures elevate the threat of invasive species-- invasive species such as the emerald ash borer and gypsy moth, which are rapidly changing the composition of our forests. in other parts of the country, we are seeing longer wildfire seasons--wildfires that are burning hotter, more intense, and bigger. the forest service is spending more and more fighting these fires--now more than half of its entire budget. so we can see that climate change poses a very serious threat to minnesota, our country, and the world. the paris agreement that we will sign tomorrow marks an important step forward to address this threat. but, of course, our job is not done. we have to remain vigilant and build upon the success of the agreement. internationally, we have to hold other nations accountable, ensure that they commit to stronger emission reduction targets over time, and make sure that those reductions are transparent and verifiable. domestically, we have to build on the success of our cities and states--like minnesota--that have been working hard for a long time now to become more energy efficient and reduce emissions. i have two grandchildren, and i am expecting a third later this year. god willing, they will live through this century and into the next. i want them to know that when we had the opportunity to put the earth on a safer path, we seized the moment. let's recognize the historic nature of this year's earth day, and let's celebrate this climate agreement because it is an important milestone. let's build on it to make the planet a safer and more habitable place for our grandchildren, their children, and their grandchildren. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from maryland. mr. cardin. mr. president, i want to thank my friend from minnesota, senator franken, for his comments concerning an important day tomorrow. it is important for many reasons. we have worked a long time to get the global community engaged on climate change. as senator franken pointed out, tomorrow is earth day. it will be the [[page s2379]] 46th anniversary of earth day, which was started by our former colleague senator gaylord nelson. he did that because he recognized it is important for this country to recognize our global responsibilities to our environment and to our future. there is no greater challenge that we face than climate change because climate change has been caused, in part, by our own activities here on earth, by the emission of greenhouse gases. we have a responsibility to reverse the current trends. we can do that. tomorrow in new york city, many leaders will come to sign the cop21 agreement that was negotiated in paris earlier this year by 16 nations representing 98 percent of the global greenhouse emissions. this is a historic moment. i want to reflect for a moment about the u.s. leadership that has brought us to this moment in which we now have an agreement among so many countries of the world. we have been trying to do this now for a long time. we have not been successful. at last, the global community has come together with meaningful commitments that will put us on the right path, and the u.s. leadership made this possible. i want to congratulate president obama for his leadership on this. i was with secretary moniz in paris. ten members of the u.s. senate went to paris during the cop21 negotiations. we were there less than 48 hours, but i think we were able to broadcast the united support for u.s. leadership for a global commitment. secretary of energy moniz took us to the exhibit where we saw firsthand u.s. technology that will help us meet the challenges of climate change--how we can produce energy more efficiently and how we can use energy more efficiently. it was u.s. technology, and that technology will be used around the world. i mention that because u.s. global leadership is critically important to help save our planet from the adverse impacts of climate change, yes, but it also will help our economy. it will help our economy, obviously, in dealing with the effects of climate change but also in u.s. technology being used around the world, creating jobs here in the united states. this is an urgent issue. if i might, let me first quote from pope francis. he said: the urgent challenge to protect our common home includes a concern to bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change. . . . i urgently appeal, for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. we need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all. . . . climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political, and for the distribution of goods. it represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. i couldn't agree with him more. this is a global challenge with global, grave consequences if we don't get it right. i see that in my own state of maryland's smith island, which is disappearing into the chesapeake bay. i see it in the chesapeake bay with the loss of sea grasses because of warmer water temperatures. sea grasses are critically important to the survival of the maryland blue crab. i see it in our coastal safety, as we see more and more storms with more consequences. recently i traveled to the southern part of africa, and i had a chance to see from a helicopter the impact of climate change. in the southern part of africa, they have only two seasons: the rainy season and the dry season. they are now at about one season: the dry season. we were there during the rainy season, and by helicopter we flew over land that should have been part of a pond. instead, it was dry, no water. we saw the carcasses of animals that couldn't survive because of the drought. climate change is real and is affecting our planet. there are vulnerable nations--from the marshall islands to bangladesh and so many others--whose very existence is at risk because of climate change. this is an urgent issue that requires an urgent response. but here we can make a difference. we can make a difference through conserving and using less energy and producing our energy in a more environmentally friendly way in a carbon-free environment. i am joined by congressman delaney and many members of both the house and senate in saying that the united states should make a commitment to produce at least 50 percent of our electricity through a carbon-free source by the year 2030. we can do that. here is the good news. it will not only be good for our environment, it will be good for our economy and good for our national security. renewable energy sources can be produced here in america. you don't have to depend on the fossil fuels from countries who disagree with our way of life. for the sake of our national security, for the sake of our national economy, there are more jobs in clean energy than there are in fossil fuel industry. for all those reasons--for our economy, for our security, and for our environment--u.s. leadership in dealing with these solutions can help america's security. yes, u.s. leadership is absolutely vital. we saw that in cop21. without u.s. leadership, it could not be done. here is where i really call upon our colleagues. i have said this many times on the floor of the senate. it is a great honor to serve in the senate; it is a great honor to represent the people of maryland. every congress has tried to add to its record to protect the future generations as it relates to our environment. the protection of our environment has never been a partisan issue. i would urge our colleagues to find ways that we can work together to build the legacy of this congress to further protect our environment for future generations. we should be part of the solution. tomorrow is earth day. let's make a difference. with what we see happening in new york and by our actions, let us protect future generations. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. sasse. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. sasse. mr. president, on behalf of senator alexander, i ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up the following first- degree amendments: merkley amendment no. 3812, reid amendment no. 3805, and flake amendment no. 3820; further, that at 11 a.m., on tuesday, april 26, the senate vote on the amendments in the order listed and with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the votes, and that there be 2 minutes

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgS2379-2,CREC-2016-04-21,114,PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT SIGNING AND EARTH DAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2379-S2381] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT SIGNING AND EARTH DAY Mr. DURBIN. Some may know that there is a section of the Washington Post called the Kids Post--a section of interesting stories written for kids in the Washington area. The writers ask area grade schoolers about their favorite books, tv shows, hobbies, and sports. Sometimes the kids are asked what they think is one of the biggest problems in the world. Last week, a fifth-grade class in Virginia was asked this question. About half the class mentioned an environmental problem such as global warming. In other recent editions when this question was asked, climate change is something these young people consistently worry about. It only makes sense. Failure to do anything about climate change today, when we still have a chance, will leave future generations--our grandchildren and their children--with a changed world--and not for the better. I know every time I look at my beautiful young grandchildren, I feel a responsibility--a moral responsibility-- [[Page S2380]] to address this problem for them and future generations. It makes me wonder why there are still so many here in this chamber and among the leading Republican Presidential candidates who deny climate change even exists, not to mention refuse to even do anything about it. How will future generations look back upon such denial and obstinance in the face of overwhelming evidence? Not kindly, I expect. I know that science tells us that our human brains evolved to address more immediate dangers, and slowly evolving dangers, especially ones that may take decades or more to materialize, don't trigger the same sense of importance. But that is not the only thing at work here. For decades, the fossil fuel industry and those in their pocket have tried to blur the debate--to blur the science--and create divisions among us instead of looking for what we have in common to solve this shared problem. Make no mistake. This is a deliberate campaign financed by the fossil fuel industry, a campaign that peddles the pseudo-science of manufactured doubt. As we approach Earth Day, all you need to do is look at the daily news to see the destructive impact of climate change. Scientists recently gained an improved understanding of the complex climate science of Antarctic ice, and they showed that, if carbon emissions were to continue unabated over the next few decades, the oceans could rise as much as 3 or 4 feet by 2100. The situation would then grow far worse in the 22nd century and beyond, likely forcing people to abandon many coastal cities. How can any member of the Senate ignore this potentially catastrophic and costly disaster? Just the other week, scientists announced troubling evidence in the South Pacific that we are reaching a point where many coral reef ecosystems may not be able to adapt to the relentless progression of climate change. Whole ecosystems that affect all of us and our food chain are being impacted. And just recently, the New York Times reported that forest fires in parts of the United States, from Alaska to New Mexico, were no longer just happening in a single season, as was the case historically. They have become year-around threats. New Mexico has had 140 such fires this year alone, double the number over the same period last year. Such fires have arrived earlier each year, are happening in winters, and in some cases burning all year along. The culprit for the drier conditions leading to these fires? Climate change. Climate change also has significant national security implications, ones we simply cannot ignore because they will impact our shores. The crisis in Syria and the flow of refugees from unstable parts of the world is an early warning of how humanitarian crises, particularly from less stable parts of our shared planet, are likely to get worse if we continue to let climate change go unaddressed. Back in 2011, when pro- democracy protests began in Syria, many of those joining were displaced farmers, who had suffered their fourth year of drought made worse by the effects of climate change. The National Academy of Sciences published findings earlier this year showing that extreme drought in Syria between 2006 and 2009 was most likely due to climate change and that the drought was a factor in the uprisings in 2011. Just last week, Pulitzer Prize Winner New York Times columnist Tom Friedman wrote about massive migration out of parts of West Africa, through the Sahara Desert, to Libya hoping to eventually cross the Mediterranean Sea into Europe. I ask unanimous consent that his April 13, 2016, column ``Out of Africa'' be printed in the Record following my remarks. He writes, ``Just as Syria's revolution was set off in part by the worst four-year drought in the country's modern history--plus overpopulation, climate stresses and the Internet--the same is true of this African migration wave.'' Friedman further explains that a United Nations official in the region showed him three maps of Africa with an outline around dots clustered in the middle of the continent. The first map showed the most vulnerable regions of desertification, made worse by recent droughts, in Africa in 2008. The second map showed conflicts and food riots in Africa during 2007 and 2008. And the third map showed terrorist attacks in Africa in 2012. All three outlines cover the same territory. Anyone serving in the U.S. Senate or running for President who claims to be serious about national security simply isn't credible without addressing the long-term threats posed by weak states and climate change in the decades to come. And now, insurance companies are tuning in because they understand the threat is real and that business assets are at stake. Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest and biggest insurance market, has recognized the threat climate change represents to business assets, risks ranging from property damage to forced displacement to food insecurity. Lloyd's has issued a call for the insurance industry to take into account the effects of climate change in their insurance modeling. The London School of Economics studied the economic impacts of climate change and put out a new report earlier this month. What they found is that, on a global scale, climate change could cost the world as little as $2.5 trillion--or, within the range of possibilities, as much as $25 trillion. This is not only a problem in the Arctic or Africa or in remote corners of the world. This is a problem close to home for us, right here and right now. In the past 6 years, Illinois has experienced historic storms, floods, and droughts that have caused millions of dollars in damage. The city of Chicago has been hit by four historic storms in the last 7 years, meaning that the flooding of basements and overflowing of wastewater systems has become an annual event. Because of climate change, U.S. growing seasons have shifted so drastically that crops which previously could survive only in the southern half of the country can now be successfully grown in northern Illinois. If current global warming trends continue, climate models estimate that Illinois will have a climate similar to that of the Texas Gulf coast by 2100. For Illinois farmers, these changes to the environment have a direct effect on their livelihood. The need to act is urgent. We are reaching the tipping point. The science is clear; the debate is settled. The destructiveness of climate change is clear and growing. Climate change is a dire threat to the global economy and global stability. It will cause catastrophic consequences for global health, food security, and habitats on land and in the ocean. If we don't act in time, there is no backup plan. No one nation can do this alone. The good news is that, together, the nations of the world can act to avoid irreversible disaster. President Obama, Secretary of State Kerry, and climate envoy Todd Stern have helped lead the way. The Paris climate agreement is a historic step in that direction. Never before have so many nations come together to tackle this threat. The draft Paris climate treaty was negotiated and adopted by consensus by 195 countries, unprecedented international cooperation in the face of the crisis. I want to congratulate President Obama for his leadership in this complex but crucial task. He and his team lead the way for an ambitious, balanced, and fair agreement. And I would like to thank Todd Stern for his contributions, steadily working over several years to build up to the success of the Paris negotiations. I wish him and his family well as he retires from the climate envoy position. Getting 195 countries to consent on the treaty is no small feat, and he achieved all this in the face of so much opposition at home. The agreement opens for signatures on April 22, Earth Day. The United States and China made a joint announcement that we will be signing the agreement on that day, the earliest possible time. I encourage other nations to follow our lead. Our generation has a moral obligation to leave the world in at least as good a shape as we inherited from our parents and grandparents. We cannot run away from our responsibility. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [[Page S2381]] [Apr. 13, 2016] Out of Africa (By Thomas L. Friedman) Agadez, Niger.--It's Monday and that means it's moving day in Agadez, the northern Niger desert crossroad that is the main launching pad for migrants out of West Africa. Fleeing devastated agriculture, overpopulation and unemployment, migrants from a dozen countries gather here in caravans every Monday night and make a mad dash through the Sahara to Libya, hoping to eventually hop across the Mediterranean to Europe. This caravan's assembly is quite a scene to witness. Although it is evening, it's still 105 degrees, and there is little more than a crescent moon to illuminate the night. Then, all of a sudden, the desert comes alive. Using the WhatsApp messaging service on their cellphones, the local smugglers, who are tied in with networks of traffickers extending across West Africa, start coordinating the surreptitious loading of migrants from safe houses and basements across the city. They've been gathering all week from Senegal, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Chad, Guinea, Cameroon, Mali and other towns in Niger. With 15 to 20 men--no women--crammed together into the back of each Toyota pickup, their arms and legs spilling over the sides, the vehicles pop out of alleyways and follow scout cars that have zoomed ahead to make sure there are no pesky police officers or border guards lurking who have not been paid off. It's like watching a symphony, but you have no idea where the conductor is. Eventually, they all converge at a gathering point north of the city, forming a giant caravan of 100 to 200 vehicles--the strength in numbers needed to ward off deserts bandits. Poor Niger. Agadez, with its warrens of ornate mud-walled buildings, is a remarkable Unesco World Heritage site, but the city has been abandoned by tourists after attacks nearby by Boko Haram and other jihadists. So, as one smuggler explains to me, the cars and buses of the tourist industry have now been repurposed into a migration industry. There are now wildcat recruiters, linked to smugglers, all across West Africa who appeal to the mothers of boys to put up the $400 to $500 to send them to seek out jobs in Libya or Europe. Few make it, but others keep coming. I am standing at the Agadez highway control station watching this parade. As the Toyotas whisk by me, kicking up dust, they paint the desert road with stunning moonlit silhouettes of young men, silently standing in the back of each vehicle. The thought that their Promised Land is war- ravaged Libya tells you how desperate are the conditions they're leaving. Between 9,000 and 10,000 men make this journey every month. A few agree to talk--nervously. One group of very young men from elsewhere in Niger tell me they're actually joining the rush to pan for gold in Djado in the far north of Niger. More typical are five young men who, in Senegalese-accented French, tell a familiar tale: no work in the village, went to the town, no work in the town, heading north. What's crazy is that as you go north of here, closer to the Libya border, to Dirkou, you run into streams of migrants coming back from Libya, which they found ungoverned, abusive and lacking in any kind of decent work. One of them, Mati Almaniq, from Niger, tells me he had left his three wives and 17 children back in his village to search for work in Libya or Europe and returned deeply disillusioned. In Libya, say migrants, you can get beaten at any moment--or arbitrarily arrested and have the police use your cellphone to call your family in Niger and demand a ransom for your release. Just as Syria's revolution was set off in part by the worst four-year drought in the country's modern history--plus overpopulation, climate stresses and the Internet--the same is true of this African migration wave. That's why I'm here filming an episode for the ``Years of Living Dangerously'' series on climate change across the planet, which will appear on National Geographic Channel next fall. I'm traveling with Monique Barbut, who heads the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification, and Adamou Chaifou, Niger's minister of environment. Chaifou explains that West Africa has experienced two decades of on-again-off-again drought. The dry periods prompt desperate people to deforest hillsides for wood for cooking or to sell, but they are now followed by increasingly violent rains, which then easily wash away the topsoil barren of trees. Meanwhile, the population explodes--mothers in Niger average seven children--as parents continue to have lots of kids for social security, and each year more fertile land gets eaten by desertification. ``We now lose 100,000 hectares of arable land every year to desertification,'' says Chaifou. ``And we lose between 60,000 and 80,000 hectares of forest every year.'' As long as anyone could remember, he says, the rainy season ``started in June and lasted until October. Now we get more big rains in April, and you need to plant right after it rains.'' But then it becomes dry again for a month or two, and then the rains come back, much more intense than before, and cause floods that wash away the crops, ``and that is a consequence of climate change''--caused, he adds, primarily by emissions from the industrial North, not from Niger or its neighbors. Says the U.N.'s Barbut, ``Desertification acts as the trigger, and climate change acts as an amplifier of the political challenges we are witnessing today: economic migrants, interethnic conflicts and extremism.'' She shows me three maps of Africa with an oblong outline around a bunch of dots clustered in the middle of the continent. Map No. 1: the most vulnerable regions of desertification in Africa in 2008. Map No. 2: conflicts and food riots in Africa 2007-2008. Map No. 3: terrorist attacks in Africa in 2012. All three outlines cover the same territory. The European Union recently struck a deal with Turkey to vastly increase E.U. aid to Ankara for dealing with refugees and migrants who have reached Turkey, in return for Turkey restricting their flow into Europe. ``If we would invest a fraction of that amount helping African nations combat deforestation, improve health and education and sustain small-scale farming, which is the livelihood of 80 percent of the people in Africa, so people here could stay on the land,'' says Barbut, ``it would be so much better for them and for the planet.'' Everyone wants to build walls these days, she notes, but the wall we need most is a ``green wall'' of reforestation that would hold back the desert and stretch from Mali in the west to Ethiopia in the east. ``It's an idea that the Africans themselves have come up with,'' she adds. It makes enormous sense. Because, in the end, no wall will hold back this surging migrant tide. Everything you see here screams that unless a way can be found to stabilize Africa's small-scale agriculture, one way or another they will try to get to Europe. Some who can't will surely gravitate toward any extremist group that pays them. Too many are now aware through mass media of the better life in Europe, and too many see their governments as too frail to help them advance themselves. I interviewed 20 men from at least 10 African countries at the International Organization for Migration aid center in Agadez--all had gone to Libya, tried and failed to get to Europe, and returned, but were penniless and unable to get back to their home villages. I asked them, ``How many of you and your friends would leave Africa and go to Europe if you could get in legally?'' ``Tout le monde,'' they practically shouted, while they all raised their hands. I don't know much French, but I think that means ``everybody.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2379-S2381] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT SIGNING AND EARTH DAY Mr. DURBIN.

With 15 to 20 men--no women--crammed together into the back of each Toyota pickup, their arms and legs spilling over the sides, the vehicles pop out of alleyways and follow scout cars that have zoomed ahead to make sure there are no pesky police officers or border guards lurking who have not been paid off. It's like watching a symphony, but you have no idea where the conductor is. Eventually, they all converge at a gathering point north of the city, forming a giant caravan of 100 to 200 vehicles--the strength in numbers needed to ward off deserts bandits. Poor Niger. Agadez, with its warrens of ornate mud-walled buildings, is a remarkable Unesco World Heritage site, but the city has been abandoned by tourists after attacks nearby by Boko Haram and other jihadists. So, as one smuggler explains to me, the cars and buses of the tourist industry have now been repurposed into a migration industry. There are now wildcat recruiters, linked to smugglers, all across West Africa who appeal to the mothers of boys to put up the $400 to $500 to send them to seek out jobs in Libya or Europe. Few make it, but others keep coming. I am standing at the Agadez highway control station watching this parade. As the Toyotas whisk by me, kicking up dust, they paint the desert road with stunning moonlit silhouettes of young men, silently standing in the back of each vehicle. The thought that their Promised Land is war- ravaged Libya tells you how desperate are the conditions they're leaving. Between 9,000 and 10,000 men make this journey every month. A few agree to talk--nervously. One group of very young men from elsewhere in Niger tell me they're actually joining the rush to pan for gold in Djado in the far north of Niger. More typical are five young men who, in Senegalese-accented French, tell a familiar tale: no work in the village, went to the town, no work in the town, heading north. What's crazy is that as you go north of here, closer to the Libya border, to Dirkou, you run into streams of migrants coming back from Libya, which they found ungoverned, abusive and lacking in any kind of decent work. One of them, Mati Almaniq, from Niger, tells me he had left his three wives and 17 children back in his village to search for work in Libya or Europe and returned deeply disillusioned. In Libya, say migrants, you can get beaten at any moment--or arbitrarily arrested and have the police use your cellphone to call your family in Niger and demand a ransom for your release. Just as Syria's revolution was set off in part by the worst four-year drought in the country's modern history--plus overpopulation, climate stresses and the Internet--the same is true of this African migration wave. That's why I'm here filming an episode for the ``Years of Living Dangerously'' series on climate change across the planet, which will appear on National Geographic Channel next fall. I'm traveling with Monique Barbut, who heads the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification, and Adamou Chaifou, Niger's minister of environment. Chaifou explains that West Africa has experienced two decades of on-again-off-again drought. The dry periods prompt desperate people to deforest hillsides for wood for cooking or to sell, but they are now followed by increasingly violent rains, which then easily wash away the topsoil barren of trees. Meanwhile, the population explodes--mothers in Niger average seven children--as parents continue to have lots of kids for social security, and each year more fertile land gets eaten by desertification. ``We now lose 100,000 hectares of arable land every year to desertification,'' says Chaifou. ``And we lose between 60,000 and 80,000 hectares of forest every year.'' As long as anyone could remember, he says, the rainy season ``started in June and lasted until October. Now we get more big rains in April, and you need to plant right after it rains.'' But then it becomes dry again for a month or two, and then the rains come back, much more intense than before, and cause floods that wash away the crops, ``and that is a consequence of climate change''--caused, he adds, primarily by emissions from the industrial North, not from Niger or its neighbors. Says the U.N.'s Barbut, ``Desertification acts as the trigger, and climate change acts as an amplifier of the political challenges we are witnessing today: economic migrants, interethnic conflicts and extremism.'' She shows me three maps of Africa with an oblong outline around a bunch of dots clustered in the middle of the continent. Map No. 1: the most vulnerable regions of desertification in Africa in 2008. Map No. 2: conflicts and food riots in Africa 2007-2008. Map No. 3: terrorist attacks in Africa in 2012. All three outlines cover the same territory. The European Union recently struck a deal with Turkey to vastly increase E.U. aid to Ankara for dealing with refugees and migrants who have reached Turkey, in return for Turkey restricting their flow into Europe. ``If we would invest a fraction of that amount helping African nations combat deforestation, improve health and education and sustain small-scale farming, which is the livelihood of 80 percent of the people in Africa, so people here could stay on the land,'' says Barbut, ``it would be so much better for them and for the planet.'' Everyone wants to build walls these days, she notes, but the wall we need most is a ``green wall'' of reforestation that would hold back the desert and stretch from Mali in the west to Ethiopia in the east. ``It's an idea that the Africans themselves have come up with,'' she adds. It makes enormous sense. Because, in the end, no wall will hold back this surging migrant tide. Everything you see here screams that unless a way can be found to stabilize Africa's small-scale agriculture, one way or another they will try to get to Europe. Some who can't will surely gravitate toward any extremist group that pays them. Too many are now aware through mass media of the better life in Europe, and too many see their governments as too frail to help them advance themselves. I interviewed 20 men from at least 10 African countries at the International Organization for Migration aid center in Agadez--all had gone to Libya, tried and failed to get to Europe, and returned, but were penniless and unable to get back to their home villages. I asked them, ``How many of you and your friends would leave Africa and go to Europe if you could get in legally?'' ``Tout le monde,'' they practically shouted, while they all raised their hands. I don't know much French, but I think that means ``everybody.'' ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2379-S2381] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT SIGNING AND EARTH DAY Mr. DURBIN. Some may know that there is a section of the Washington Post called the Kids Post--a section of interesting stories written for kids in the Washington area. The writers ask area grade schoolers about their favorite books, tv shows, hobbies, and sports. Sometimes the kids are asked what they think is one of the biggest problems in the world. Last week, a fifth-grade class in Virginia was asked this question. About half the class mentioned an environmental problem such as global warming. In other recent editions when this question was asked, climate change is something these young people consistently worry about. It only makes sense. Failure to do anything about climate change today, when we still have a chance, will leave future generations--our grandchildren and their children--with a changed world--and not for the better. I know every time I look at my beautiful young grandchildren, I feel a responsibility--a moral responsibility-- [[Page S2380]] to address this problem for them and future generations. It makes me wonder why there are still so many here in this chamber and among the leading Republican Presidential candidates who deny climate change even exists, not to mention refuse to even do anything about it. How will future generations look back upon such denial and obstinance in the face of overwhelming evidence? Not kindly, I expect. I know that science tells us that our human brains evolved to address more immediate dangers, and slowly evolving dangers, especially ones that may take decades or more to materialize, don't trigger the same sense of importance. But that is not the only thing at work here. For decades, the fossil fuel industry and those in their pocket have tried to blur the debate--to blur the science--and create divisions among us instead of looking for what we have in common to solve this shared problem. Make no mistake. This is a deliberate campaign financed by the fossil fuel industry, a campaign that peddles the pseudo-science of manufactured doubt. As we approach Earth Day, all you need to do is look at the daily news to see the destructive impact of climate change. Scientists recently gained an improved understanding of the complex climate science of Antarctic ice, and they showed that, if carbon emissions were to continue unabated over the next few decades, the oceans could rise as much as 3 or 4 feet by 2100. The situation would then grow far worse in the 22nd century and beyond, likely forcing people to abandon many coastal cities. How can any member of the Senate ignore this potentially catastrophic and costly disaster? Just the other week, scientists announced troubling evidence in the South Pacific that we are reaching a point where many coral reef ecosystems may not be able to adapt to the relentless progression of climate change. Whole ecosystems that affect all of us and our food chain are being impacted. And just recently, the New York Times reported that forest fires in parts of the United States, from Alaska to New Mexico, were no longer just happening in a single season, as was the case historically. They have become year-around threats. New Mexico has had 140 such fires this year alone, double the number over the same period last year. Such fires have arrived earlier each year, are happening in winters, and in some cases burning all year along. The culprit for the drier conditions leading to these fires? Climate change. Climate change also has significant national security implications, ones we simply cannot ignore because they will impact our shores. The crisis in Syria and the flow of refugees from unstable parts of the world is an early warning of how humanitarian crises, particularly from less stable parts of our shared planet, are likely to get worse if we continue to let climate change go unaddressed. Back in 2011, when pro- democracy protests began in Syria, many of those joining were displaced farmers, who had suffered their fourth year of drought made worse by the effects of climate change. The National Academy of Sciences published findings earlier this year showing that extreme drought in Syria between 2006 and 2009 was most likely due to climate change and that the drought was a factor in the uprisings in 2011. Just last week, Pulitzer Prize Winner New York Times columnist Tom Friedman wrote about massive migration out of parts of West Africa, through the Sahara Desert, to Libya hoping to eventually cross the Mediterranean Sea into Europe. I ask unanimous consent that his April 13, 2016, column ``Out of Africa'' be printed in the Record following my remarks. He writes, ``Just as Syria's revolution was set off in part by the worst four-year drought in the country's modern history--plus overpopulation, climate stresses and the Internet--the same is true of this African migration wave.'' Friedman further explains that a United Nations official in the region showed him three maps of Africa with an outline around dots clustered in the middle of the continent. The first map showed the most vulnerable regions of desertification, made worse by recent droughts, in Africa in 2008. The second map showed conflicts and food riots in Africa during 2007 and 2008. And the third map showed terrorist attacks in Africa in 2012. All three outlines cover the same territory. Anyone serving in the U.S. Senate or running for President who claims to be serious about national security simply isn't credible without addressing the long-term threats posed by weak states and climate change in the decades to come. And now, insurance companies are tuning in because they understand the threat is real and that business assets are at stake. Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest and biggest insurance market, has recognized the threat climate change represents to business assets, risks ranging from property damage to forced displacement to food insecurity. Lloyd's has issued a call for the insurance industry to take into account the effects of climate change in their insurance modeling. The London School of Economics studied the economic impacts of climate change and put out a new report earlier this month. What they found is that, on a global scale, climate change could cost the world as little as $2.5 trillion--or, within the range of possibilities, as much as $25 trillion. This is not only a problem in the Arctic or Africa or in remote corners of the world. This is a problem close to home for us, right here and right now. In the past 6 years, Illinois has experienced historic storms, floods, and droughts that have caused millions of dollars in damage. The city of Chicago has been hit by four historic storms in the last 7 years, meaning that the flooding of basements and overflowing of wastewater systems has become an annual event. Because of climate change, U.S. growing seasons have shifted so drastically that crops which previously could survive only in the southern half of the country can now be successfully grown in northern Illinois. If current global warming trends continue, climate models estimate that Illinois will have a climate similar to that of the Texas Gulf coast by 2100. For Illinois farmers, these changes to the environment have a direct effect on their livelihood. The need to act is urgent. We are reaching the tipping point. The science is clear; the debate is settled. The destructiveness of climate change is clear and growing. Climate change is a dire threat to the global economy and global stability. It will cause catastrophic consequences for global health, food security, and habitats on land and in the ocean. If we don't act in time, there is no backup plan. No one nation can do this alone. The good news is that, together, the nations of the world can act to avoid irreversible disaster. President Obama, Secretary of State Kerry, and climate envoy Todd Stern have helped lead the way. The Paris climate agreement is a historic step in that direction. Never before have so many nations come together to tackle this threat. The draft Paris climate treaty was negotiated and adopted by consensus by 195 countries, unprecedented international cooperation in the face of the crisis. I want to congratulate President Obama for his leadership in this complex but crucial task. He and his team lead the way for an ambitious, balanced, and fair agreement. And I would like to thank Todd Stern for his contributions, steadily working over several years to build up to the success of the Paris negotiations. I wish him and his family well as he retires from the climate envoy position. Getting 195 countries to consent on the treaty is no small feat, and he achieved all this in the face of so much opposition at home. The agreement opens for signatures on April 22, Earth Day. The United States and China made a joint announcement that we will be signing the agreement on that day, the earliest possible time. I encourage other nations to follow our lead. Our generation has a moral obligation to leave the world in at least as good a shape as we inherited from our parents and grandparents. We cannot run away from our responsibility. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [[Page S2381]] [Apr. 13, 2016] Out of Africa (By Thomas L. Friedman) Agadez, Niger.--It's Monday and that means it's moving day in Agadez, the northern Niger desert crossroad that is the main launching pad for migrants out of West Africa. Fleeing devastated agriculture, overpopulation and unemployment, migrants from a dozen countries gather here in caravans every Monday night and make a mad dash through the Sahara to Libya, hoping to eventually hop across the Mediterranean to Europe. This caravan's assembly is quite a scene to witness. Although it is evening, it's still 105 degrees, and there is little more than a crescent moon to illuminate the night. Then, all of a sudden, the desert comes alive. Using the WhatsApp messaging service on their cellphones, the local smugglers, who are tied in with networks of traffickers extending across West Africa, start coordinating the surreptitious loading of migrants from safe houses and basements across the city. They've been gathering all week from Senegal, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Chad, Guinea, Cameroon, Mali and other towns in Niger.

thought that their promised land is war- ravaged libya tells you how desperate are the conditions they're leaving. between 9,000 and 10,000 men make this journey every month. a few agree to talk--nervously. one group of very young men from elsewhere in niger tell me they're actually joining the rush to pan for gold in djado in the far north of niger. more typical are five young men who, in senegalese-accented french, tell a familiar tale: no work in the village, went to the town, no work in the town, heading north. what's crazy is that as you go north of here, closer to the libya border, to dirkou, you run into streams of migrants coming back from libya, which they found ungoverned, abusive and lacking in any kind of decent work. one of them, mati almaniq, from niger, tells me he had left his three wives and 17 children back in his village to search for work in libya or europe and returned deeply disillusioned. in libya, say migrants, you can get beaten at any moment--or arbitrarily arrested and have the police use your cellphone to call your family in niger and demand a ransom for your release. just as syria's revolution was set off in part by the worst four-year drought in the country's modern history--plus overpopulation, climate stresses and the internet--the same is true of this african migration wave. that's why i'm here filming an episode for the ``years of living dangerously'' series on climate change across the planet, which will appear on national geographic channel next fall. i'm traveling with monique barbut, who heads the u.n. convention to combat desertification, and adamou chaifou, niger's minister of environment. chaifou explains that west africa has experienced two decades of on-again-off-again drought. the dry periods prompt desperate people to deforest hillsides for wood for cooking or to sell, but they are now followed by increasingly violent rains, which then easily wash away the topsoil barren of trees. meanwhile, the population explodes--mothers in niger average seven children--as parents continue to have lots of kids for social security, and each year more fertile land gets eaten by desertification. ``we now lose 100,000 hectares of arable land every year to desertification,'' says chaifou. ``and we lose between 60,000 and 80,000 hectares of forest every year.'' as long as anyone could remember, he says, the rainy season ``started in june and lasted until october. now we get more big rains in april, and you need to plant right after it rains.'' but then it becomes dry again for a month or two, and then the rains come back, much more intense than before, and cause floods that wash away the crops, ``and that is a consequence of climate change''--caused, he adds, primarily by emissions from the industrial north, not from niger or its neighbors. says the u.n.'s barbut, ``desertification acts as the trigger, and climate change acts as an amplifier of the political challenges we are witnessing today: economic migrants, interethnic conflicts and extremism.'' she shows me three maps of africa with an oblong outline around a bunch of dots clustered in the middle of the continent. map no. 1: the most vulnerable regions of desertification in africa in 2008. map no. 2: conflicts and food riots in africa 2007-2008. map no. 3: terrorist attacks in africa in 2012. all three outlines cover the same territory. the european union recently struck a deal with turkey to vastly increase e.u. aid to ankara for dealing with refugees and migrants who have reached turkey, in return for turkey restricting their flow into europe. ``if we would invest a fraction of that amount helping african nations combat deforestation, improve health and education and sustain small-scale farming, which is the livelihood of 80 percent of the people in africa, so people here could stay on the land,'' says barbut, ``it would be so much better for them and for the planet.'' everyone wants to build walls these days, she notes, but the wall we need most is a ``green wall'' of reforestation that would hold back the desert and stretch from mali in the west to ethiopia in the east. ``it's an idea that the africans themselves have come up with,'' she adds. it makes enormous sense. because, in the end, no wall will hold back this surging migrant tide. everything you see here screams that unless a way can be found to stabilize africa's small-scale agriculture, one way or another they will try to get to europe. some who can't will surely gravitate toward any extremist group that pays them. too many are now aware through mass media of the better life in europe, and too many see their governments as too frail to help them advance themselves. i interviewed 20 men from at least 10 african countries at the international organization for migration aid center in agadez--all had gone to libya, tried and failed to get to europe, and returned, but were penniless and unable to get back to their home villages. i asked them, ``how many of you and your friends would leave africa and go to europe if you could get in legally?'' ``tout le monde,'' they practically shouted, while they all raised their hands. i don't know much french, but i think that means ``everybody.'' ____________________",17188
CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgS2381,CREC-2016-04-21,114,ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2381-S2382] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I want to applaud Senators Murkowski and Cantwell, the chair and ranking member of the Energy Committee, for their leadership and tenacity in passing yesterday's bipartisan Energy bill on the floor. This kind of bipartisanship has always been the political fuel that has driven some of our most important energy legislation. I thank them for their commitment to working together in a bipartisan fashion to pass this bill, and I look forward to working with them and all of my colleagues going forward to capture all of the potential for America's clean energy future. There are many good provisions in this bill. The bill promotes energy efficiency in our buildings and appliances. It will help to modernize our electrical grid and support energy storage technologies. It permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The bill includes a number of provisions and amendments that I authored that were accepted on the floor. I was pleased that my bipartisan legislation with Senators Inhofe, Rounds, and Booker to reauthorize EPA's brownfields program through 2018 was included in the Energy bill. This legislation will help clean up the decades of abuse our lands have experienced at the hands of corporate polluters. It will help to create jobs and spur economic activity in Massachusetts and around the country, while revitalizing underutilized and polluted lands. In December, Congress voted to lift the 40-year old restrictions on exporting U.S. oil overseas. During that debate, I and other Senators raised concerns regarding the impacts that exporting American oil abroad could have on U.S. consumers and refined fuel prices, independent refineries, and other sectors of the U.S. economy such as shipbuilding. However, the final legislation did not even include any requirement for analyzing and reporting on any potential impacts that exports could have on these industries or on U.S. consumers. Therefore, I offered an amendment, which the Senate adopted, that would require the Government Accountability Office, GAO to review and report back annually for 3 years on the impacts of crude oil exports on U.S. consumers, independent refineries, shipbuilders, and energy production. [[Page S2382]] Exporting American crude oil could be a disaster for independent refineries in regions such as the east coast. Upwards of 55 percent of our refining capacity on the east coast could potentially close as a result of oil exports. The Energy Department has said that exports could lead to as much as $9 billion less investment and 1.6 million barrels less refining capacity in 10 years. It could lead to up to $200 billion less revenue for the U.S. refining sector over the next decade. It could raise prices for consumers who are currently saving $700 a year at the pump and $500 on heating oil this winter because of low oil prices. And it could harm U.S. shipbuilders. We have been having a shipbuilding renaissance in this country. We are currently seeing the biggest shipbuilding boom in 20 years. But exports could stop all of this in its tracks. We should know how exporting American oil is affecting American consumers. We should know how it is affecting key sectors of our economy such as refining and shipbuilding. And we should know how it is affecting energy production in the United States. That is what my amendment would help us do, and I am pleased that it was adopted into the bill. The bill also includes a bipartisan amendment that I authored with Senator Cassidy to improve the way that we are going to be selling oil under a law passed last year to better protect taxpayers. Our Nation's oil stockpile is supposed to be there to protect American consumers and our security in the event of an emergency. We shouldn't use it as a piggybank to fund other priorities. But that is precisely what we did in two bills passed last year. But if we are going to sell oil from our strategic stockpile, we should do so strategically to get the best deal for taxpayers and drive down prices for consumers. That is what the Cassidy-Markey amendment would help us do. For the sales of SPR oil required by the Budget Act that became law last year, the Cassidy-Markey amendment would give the Secretary of Energy more flexibility to sell oil when prices are high. This fix should allow us to sell fewer overall barrels from the SPR and get a better return on these sales for American taxpayers. I am pleased that the Senate voted to adopt this commonsense amendment. However, there are a number of provisions in the bill with which I have concerns. The bill would apply a 45-day shot-clock to the Department of Energy's review of liquefied natural gas export applications. There is no problem with the Energy Department delaying its review of LNG export applications. If there is any problem, it is that the Energy Department is moving too fast to approve these exports of American natural gas overseas. Exporting less than half of the volumes of natural gas that the Department has already approved for export could drive prices up by more than 50 percent for American consumers and businesses. This would be a disaster for consumers in many regions of the country, such as the Northeast. It would be a disaster for domestic manufacturing, where low U.S. prices give us a competitive advantage with the rest of the world. I have urged the Department to take a time-out from approving new LNG exports until we more fully understand how the volumes we have already approved will affect various regions of our country and our energy security. That is what we should be doing, not artificially truncating the review process. I am similarly concerned that a provision about forest bioenergy would interfere with the EPA's scientific review process of the carbon pollution implications of biomass electricity and potentially interfere--with EPA's statutory responsibilities. The provision directs Federal policies to ``reflect the carbon neutrality of forest bioenergy.'' But not all biomass energy is created equal. The timeframe for any climate benefits from biomass energy can vary. In many instances that timeframe can be very long--on the order of 50 to 100 years. Some practices, like clearcutting forests and burning whole trees for energy should never be considered carbon neutral. That is why it is critical to incorporate what science tells us about forests and their interaction with the global carbon cycle into policies governing biomass energy. Biomass energy is already contributing to the U.S. energy mix in ways that help reduce carbon pollution that causes global warming. I look forward to working with my colleagues as this bill moves through conference to ensure that the United States has a smart, sustainable, and scientifically-backed policy for biomass energy. The bill also contains provisions regarding hydropower relicensing. I appreciate the willingness of Senators Murkowski and Cantwell to engage with stakeholders on hydropower relicensing and that they have crafted language that is a vast improvement compared to the House version. It took me much of 1985 and 1986 to reach consensus on the bipartisan Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986 that for the first time required FERC to give equal consideration to the environment, fish and wildlife, and other nonpower values as it gives to power and development objectives in making licensing decisions. I know how challenging it can be to find solutions that all stakeholders can support. But these hydropower licenses are good for decades, and we need to make sure that FERC's decisions are informed by the best, most up-to-date information, especially in the face of changing rainfall patterns driven by global warming. So I am concerned that this provision in the Energy bill could limit the ability of Federal agencies to require companies to undertake new analyses on the impacts of their dams by emphasizing the use of existing studies and data. I am also concerned that the provision could require agencies to evaluate the impact of their recommendations on issues beyond their core abilities. Rather than speeding up the relicensing process, this could slow it down. Rather than saving taxpayers money, it could require more financial resources for Federal agencies. Finally, I am concerned about what is not in this bill. The tax breaks for the oil, gas, and coal industries are permanent pieces of the TAX CODE that never expire. Meanwhile, tax breaks for wind power will begin phasing down in 8 months and be gone by the end of 2019. The tax breaks for solar will expire in 2021. That schedule would be a disaster for offshore wind in particular, which has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs in Massachusetts and up and down the east coast. In fact, the Department of Energy has found that that there would be no offshore wind projects that would be able to qualify for these tax credits before they expire. That is just wrong. We need to put clean energy technologies on equal footing with mature fossil fuel industries, whose tax breaks date as far back as 100 years. Senators Cantwell and Wyden put forward a Democratic energy bill which I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of, which would repeal these fossil fuel tax breaks and invest in clean energy. It would create a goal for reducing our emission of carbon pollution. And it would create an energy efficiency standard such as I have proposed. These are some of the measures that we should be considering to truly allow us to be a leader in developing clean energy technologies and jobs here in the United States. As we work with the House on this Energy bill, we need to build on the bipartisan efforts that have been done in this bill and ensure that the Senate continues to reject the damaging and highly partisan provisions that the House has included in its bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure a final Energy bill that improves America's economy and environment. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2381-S2382] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL Mr. MARKEY.

I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure a final Energy bill that improves America's economy and environment. ____________________",package_114_168.csv,10285,10285,10354,"[congressional record volume 162, number 62 (thursday, april 21, 2016)] [senate] [pages s2381-s2382] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] energy policy modernization bill mr. markey. mr. president, i want to applaud senators murkowski and cantwell, the chair and ranking member of the energy committee, for their leadership and tenacity in passing yesterday's bipartisan energy bill on the floor. this kind of bipartisanship has always been the political fuel that has driven some of our most important energy legislation. i thank them for their commitment to working together in a bipartisan fashion to pass this bill, and i look forward to working with them and all of my colleagues going forward to capture all of the potential for america's clean energy future. there are many good provisions in this bill. the bill promotes energy efficiency in our buildings and appliances. it will help to modernize our electrical grid and support energy storage technologies. it permanently reauthorizes the land and water conservation fund. the bill includes a number of provisions and amendments that i authored that were accepted on the floor. i was pleased that my bipartisan legislation with senators inhofe, rounds, and booker to reauthorize epa's brownfields program through 2018 was included in the energy bill. this legislation will help clean up the decades of abuse our lands have experienced at the hands of corporate polluters. it will help to create jobs and spur economic activity in massachusetts and around the country, while revitalizing underutilized and polluted lands. in december, congress voted to lift the 40-year old restrictions on exporting u.s. oil overseas. during that debate, i and other senators raised concerns regarding the impacts that exporting american oil abroad could have on u.s. consumers and refined fuel prices, independent refineries, and other sectors of the u.s. economy such as shipbuilding. however, the final legislation did not even include any requirement for analyzing and reporting on any potential impacts that exports could have on these industries or on u.s. consumers. therefore, i offered an amendment, which the senate adopted, that would require the government accountability office, gao to review and report back annually for 3 years on the impacts of crude oil exports on u.s. consumers, independent refineries, shipbuilders, and energy production. [[page s2382]] exporting american crude oil could be a disaster for independent refineries in regions such as the east coast. upwards of 55 percent of our refining capacity on the east coast could potentially close as a result of oil exports. the energy department has said that exports could lead to as much as $9 billion less investment and 1.6 million barrels less refining capacity in 10 years. it could lead to up to $200 billion less revenue for the u.s. refining sector over the next decade. it could raise prices for consumers who are currently saving $700 a year at the pump and $500 on heating oil this winter because of low oil prices. and it could harm u.s. shipbuilders. we have been having a shipbuilding renaissance in this country. we are currently seeing the biggest shipbuilding boom in 20 years. but exports could stop all of this in its tracks. we should know how exporting american oil is affecting american consumers. we should know how it is affecting key sectors of our economy such as refining and shipbuilding. and we should know how it is affecting energy production in the united states. that is what my amendment would help us do, and i am pleased that it was adopted into the bill. the bill also includes a bipartisan amendment that i authored with senator cassidy to improve the way that we are going to be selling oil under a law passed last year to better protect taxpayers. our nation's oil stockpile is supposed to be there to protect american consumers and our security in the event of an emergency. we shouldn't use it as a piggybank to fund other priorities. but that is precisely what we did in two bills passed last year. but if we are going to sell oil from our strategic stockpile, we should do so strategically to get the best deal for taxpayers and drive down prices for consumers. that is what the cassidy-markey amendment would help us do. for the sales of spr oil required by the budget act that became law last year, the cassidy-markey amendment would give the secretary of energy more flexibility to sell oil when prices are high. this fix should allow us to sell fewer overall barrels from the spr and get a better return on these sales for american taxpayers. i am pleased that the senate voted to adopt this commonsense amendment. however, there are a number of provisions in the bill with which i have concerns. the bill would apply a 45-day shot-clock to the department of energy's review of liquefied natural gas export applications. there is no problem with the energy department delaying its review of lng export applications. if there is any problem, it is that the energy department is moving too fast to approve these exports of american natural gas overseas. exporting less than half of the volumes of natural gas that the department has already approved for export could drive prices up by more than 50 percent for american consumers and businesses. this would be a disaster for consumers in many regions of the country, such as the northeast. it would be a disaster for domestic manufacturing, where low u.s. prices give us a competitive advantage with the rest of the world. i have urged the department to take a time-out from approving new lng exports until we more fully understand how the volumes we have already approved will affect various regions of our country and our energy security. that is what we should be doing, not artificially truncating the review process. i am similarly concerned that a provision about forest bioenergy would interfere with the epa's scientific review process of the carbon pollution implications of biomass electricity and potentially interfere--with epa's statutory responsibilities. the provision directs federal policies to ``reflect the carbon neutrality of forest bioenergy.'' but not all biomass energy is created equal. the timeframe for any climate benefits from biomass energy can vary. in many instances that timeframe can be very long--on the order of 50 to 100 years. some practices, like clearcutting forests and burning whole trees for energy should never be considered carbon neutral. that is why it is critical to incorporate what science tells us about forests and their interaction with the global carbon cycle into policies governing biomass energy. biomass energy is already contributing to the u.s. energy mix in ways that help reduce carbon pollution that causes global warming. i look forward to working with my colleagues as this bill moves through conference to ensure that the united states has a smart, sustainable, and scientifically-backed policy for biomass energy. the bill also contains provisions regarding hydropower relicensing. i appreciate the willingness of senators murkowski and cantwell to engage with stakeholders on hydropower relicensing and that they have crafted language that is a vast improvement compared to the house version. it took me much of 1985 and 1986 to reach consensus on the bipartisan electric consumers protection act of 1986 that for the first time required ferc to give equal consideration to the environment, fish and wildlife, and other nonpower values as it gives to power and development objectives in making licensing decisions. i know how challenging it can be to find solutions that all stakeholders can support. but these hydropower licenses are good for decades, and we need to make sure that ferc's decisions are informed by the best, most up-to-date information, especially in the face of changing rainfall patterns driven by global warming. so i am concerned that this provision in the energy bill could limit the ability of federal agencies to require companies to undertake new analyses on the impacts of their dams by emphasizing the use of existing studies and data. i am also concerned that the provision could require agencies to evaluate the impact of their recommendations on issues beyond their core abilities. rather than speeding up the relicensing process, this could slow it down. rather than saving taxpayers money, it could require more financial resources for federal agencies. finally, i am concerned about what is not in this bill. the tax breaks for the oil, gas, and coal industries are permanent pieces of the tax code that never expire. meanwhile, tax breaks for wind power will begin phasing down in 8 months and be gone by the end of 2019. the tax breaks for solar will expire in 2021. that schedule would be a disaster for offshore wind in particular, which has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs in massachusetts and up and down the east coast. in fact, the department of energy has found that that there would be no offshore wind projects that would be able to qualify for these tax credits before they expire. that is just wrong. we need to put clean energy technologies on equal footing with mature fossil fuel industries, whose tax breaks date as far back as 100 years. senators cantwell and wyden put forward a democratic energy bill which i was pleased to be an original cosponsor of, which would repeal these fossil fuel tax breaks and invest in clean energy. it would create a goal for reducing our emission of carbon pollution. and it would create an energy efficiency standard such as i have proposed. these are some of the measures that we should be considering to truly allow us to be a leader in developing clean energy technologies and jobs here in the united states. as we work with the house on this energy bill, we need to build on the bipartisan efforts that have been done in this bill and ensure that the senate continues to reject the damaging and highly partisan provisions that the house has included in its bill. i look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure a final energy bill that improves america's economy and environment. ____________________",10285
CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgS2382,CREC-2016-04-21,114,150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2382-S2383] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my hometown of Scranton, PA, as it celebrates its 150th anniversary, or sesquicentennial. Ever since William Penn invited carpenters, masons, weavers, and other skilled workers to settle in Pennsylvania, the story of our Commonwealth, and in particular northeastern Pennsylvania, has been the story of working people. At the dawn of the 19th century, what would become known as the city of Scranton became a home to new immigrants who fought desperately to escape the horrors of religious persecution, famine, and poverty in Europe and dreamed of a better life. Many of [[Page S2383]] the new settlers worked in the darkness and danger of the anthracite coal mines in order to provide for their families. My grandfather, Alphonsus Casey, at the age of 11, was one of those workers. He was a ``mule boy'' who was once kicked in the face by a mule, sustaining a deep cut from his forehead, across his face. As my father would recall years later, ``There were no benefits--no worker's compensation, no safety net in place to take care of the adult worker, much less an injured child.'' A 2002 book, ``A History of the Commonwealth,'' described the lives of our region's coal miners as ones of ``danger and economic uncertainty.'' The great novelist Stephen Crane recounted a visit to one mine in the region by describing an ``extraordinary, black puzzle'' in which the ``shouts of mule-boys'' were sometimes the only sounds. The work ethic of those who descended into the depth and darkness of those mines shaped Scranton and impacts the city all these years later. As the coal jobs were lost, the city and the region went through a painful transition that left scars on our land and our people. What has undergirded the city of Scranton's resilience over all these years has been a heritage of hard work and sacrifice and an enduring belief in the promise of tomorrow. Today Scranton's economy has been transformed by so-called ``meds and eds.'' The city is home to some of our State's top universities and medical facilities. It is a community of entrepreneurs and is being shaped by a new generation of immigrants seeking the same better life as Scrantonians of an earlier era. Driving the city's education sector are the five colleges and universities that are preparing thousands of students for careers in the 21st-century economy--advanced manufacturing, technology, and energy. The Commonwealth Medical College, which is the first M.D.- granting medical school built in Pennsylvania since 1962, is providing state-of-the-art medical education to medical students from across the globe. In addition, Commonwealth Health and Geisinger have entered the medical market in Lackawanna County and are investing over $300 million in innovative technology and improved medical care. For the last 150 years, Scranton's story has been part of the fabric of our Nation. As the city looks forward to the next 150 years, it is uniquely positioned to create its own future. Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the city of Scranton on its 150th anniversary and highlight the rich and industrious heritage that has continued to drive the Electric City well into the 21st century. The story of Scranton is unique and yet distinctly American. The city's visionary founders, brothers George and Selden Scranton, arrived in the Lackawanna Valley in the early 1840s and, after early failures, became the first Americans to produce iron rails on a mass scale. Railroads expanded dramatically throughout the United States once these crucial components became available, and Scranton became a hub of commerce, manufacturing, and transportation. By the 1860s, the Scranton family's company had grown into the second largest iron-manufacturing center in America, employing thousands of people. With 35,000 residents at the time, Scranton was officially incorporated as a city on April 23, 1866, and would become the county seat for the newly formed Lackawanna County in 1878. The success of Scranton's coal, iron, and steel industries served as a catalyst for other important enterprises in the region. Large-scale textile, printing, and food-processing operations, together with increased educational opportunities, all played a vital role in the region's growth. Between 1860 and 1910, Scranton's flourishing industrial activity drew thousands of new immigrants. The story of the Scranton family's endeavor, now known as the Lackawanna Steel Company, is one of the greatest success stories of American manufacturing. Through perseverance and dedication, Scranton grew from a small, agrarian village to a thriving, multicultural city. Today Scranton is a leader in higher education, medicine, and manufacturing. Driving Scranton's development are five institutions of higher education preparing thousands of students for a 21st century economy. For example, the Commonwealth Medical College provides state- of-the art medical education to students from across the globe, and companies in Lackawanna County have made significant investments in innovative technology and improved medical care. Scranton is well- positioned to be a beacon for entrepreneurs and businesses looking to take advantage of the high-quality workforce that Scranton's colleges and technical schools are producing. Today I wish to recognize the profound contributions that the city of Scranton and its residents have made to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania over the last 150 years. I wish them all the best as the people of Scranton celebrate the city's sesquicentennial anniversary on April 23, 2016. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2382-S2383] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON Mr. CASEY.

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgS2383,CREC-2016-04-21,114,75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CIVIL AIR PATROL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2383-S2384] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CIVIL AIR PATROL Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Civil Air Patrol as it celebrates its 75th anniversary this year. The Civil Air Patrol has been a tremendous contributor in our great State, and I am honored to recognize and congratulate it on this important milestone. The Civil Air Patrol was founded on December 1, 1941, the week before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, by a group of brave civilians interested in donating both their aviation skills and free time to protecting the Nation's coastlines during World War II, in addition to contributing to other civil defense missions. During this time, pilots volunteering with the Civil Air Patrol flew more than 500,000 hours and helped in a variety of ways, including patrolling the coastline for submarine activity, monitoring our forests and southern borders, and searching for ships and personnel in distress. On July 1, 1946, the Civil Air Patrol was established as a federally chartered nonprofit corporation by President Harry Truman. Following this, on May 26, 1948, Congress passed a law, designating the Civil Air Patrol as the Air Force Auxiliary and establishing primary missions for the Civil Air Patrol. The legislation established that the Civil Air Patrol would focus on emergency services, cadet programs, and aerospace education. Today this important organization is a national community service group with 31,000 professionally trained civilian volunteers and serves as a partner to the U.S. Air Force as a member of its total force. The Civil Air Patrol serves to assist Federal, State, and local governments and offers assistance for homeland security missions, counterdrug efforts, search and rescue missions, and disaster relief. The Nevada Wing Civil Air Patrol upholds these values, maintaining strong search and rescue programs, cadet programs, and aerospace education, and has a far-reaching positive impact on both urban and rural communities throughout the Silver State. The many volunteers contributing to the Nevada Wing have helped at a variety of events, departments, and facilities across the State, including the State Veterans Home, the Boulder City and Fernley Veterans Cemeteries, Operation Home Front, Blue Star Widows, Nevada Department of Emergency Management Search and Rescue Board, and many more. In addition, the Nevada Wing has strengthened its relationship with the Nevada Department of Emergency Management and has reinforced its incident management action team, triggering a quicker and more thorough response to support calls from across the Nation. This incredible wing's contributions to both adults and children across the State are invaluable. I extend my deepest gratitude to the many men and women who volunteer for the Nevada wing for their genuine concern and services in helping others. The legacy they have built for the Nevada Wing will live on for generations to come. For three-quarters of a century, the Civil Air Patrol has proven its unwavering dedication to our State and to our country. The hard work of those that have served both nationally at the Civil Air Patrol and within the Nevada Wing has not gone unnoticed. These courageous men and women stand as role models in their pursuits to help others in states of emergency and in [[Page S2384]] everyday events. I ask Nevadans across the Silver State and my colleagues to join me in honoring the Civil Air Patrol on its 75th anniversary and in thanking the Civil Air Patrol for its commendable missions. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2383-S2384] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CIVIL AIR PATROL Mr. HELLER.

During this time, pilots volunteering with the Civil Air Patrol flew more than 500,000 hours and helped in a variety of ways, including patrolling the coastline for submarine activity, monitoring our forests and southern borders, and searching for ships and personnel in distress.

HAYES PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY & MUSEUMS Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 100th anniversary of the Hayes Presidential Library & Museums in Fremont, OH. On May 30, 1916, COL Webb Hayes, son of President Rutherford B. Hayes, made his father's papers and artifacts available to the public for research with the opening of a library and museum on his parents' estate, Spiegel Grove. It was the first in what is now a Federal presidential library system. Spiegel Grove is unique in that the former President's home, tomb, museum, and library are all on the same site, which sits on 25 acres surrounded by six sets of gates originally located at the White House. The site has continued to grow and change since its opening. In 2012, a $1.5 million restoration of the Hayes Home was completed. Major additions to the museum in 1922 and 1968 brought the building to its present configuration comprising of 52,640 square feet. In January 2016, the museum temporarily closed to the public to undergo a $1.6 million renovation, which will premiere Memorial Day weekend 2016. It is the mission of the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Library & Museums ``to enrich lives through the historical preservation of Spiegel Grove and to provide a greater understanding of President Hayes and his contributions to the State of Ohio, the country, and his fellow Americans.'' In keeping with that mission, the organization uses its resources, including 21,000 artifacts, 80,000 books, and 6,000 linear feet of manuscript collections, to illustrate the life and times of Rutherford B. Hayes, his family, and his Presidency. We are honored to have this American treasure located in the State of Ohio. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2384] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RUTHERFORD B.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor 461 high school seniors in eight northeast Ohio counties for their commendable decision to enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. Of these 461 seniors from 127 high schools in 94 towns and cities, 141 will enter the Army, 126 will enter the Marine Corps, 61 will enter the Navy, 25 will enter the Air Force, 1 will enter the Coast Guard, 103 will enter our Ohio Army National Guard, and 4 will enter the Ohio Air National Guard. In the presence of their parents/guardians, high school counselors, military leaders, and city and business leaders, all 461 will be recognized on May 4, 2016, by Our Community Salutes of northeast Ohio. In a few short weeks, these young men and women will join with many of their classmates in celebration of their high school graduation. At a time when many of their peers are looking forward to pursuing vocational training or college degrees or are uncertain about their future, these young men and women instead have chosen to dedicate themselves to military service in defense of our rights, our freedoms, and our country. They should know that they have full support of this Senate Chamber and the American people, who are with them in whatever challenges may lie ahead. These 461 young men and women are the cornerstone of our liberties. It is thanks to their dedication and the dedication of an untold number of patriots just like them that we are able to meet here today in the U.S. Senate and openly debate the best solutions to the many diverse problems that confront our country. It is thanks to their sacrifices that the United States of America remains a beacon of hope and freedom in a dangerous world. We are grateful to them, and we are grateful to their parents and their communities for instilling in them not only the mental and physical abilities our Armed Forces require but, more importantly, the character, the values, and the discipline that leads someone to put service to our Nation over self. I would like to personally thank these 461 graduating seniors for their selflessness and the courage that they have shown by volunteering to risk their lives in defense of our Nation. We owe them, along with all those who serve our country, a deep debt of gratitude. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of the 461 high school seniors.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor 461 high school seniors in eight northeast Ohio counties for their commendable decision to enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. Of these 461 seniors from 127 high schools in 94 towns and cities, 141 will enter the Army, 126 will enter the Marine Corps, 61 will enter the Navy, 25 will enter the Air Force, 1 will enter the Coast Guard, 103 will enter our Ohio Army National Guard, and 4 will enter the Ohio Air National Guard. In the presence of their parents/guardians, high school counselors, military leaders, and city and business leaders, all 461 will be recognized on May 4, 2016, by Our Community Salutes of northeast Ohio. In a few short weeks, these young men and women will join with many of their classmates in celebration of their high school graduation. At a time when many of their peers are looking forward to pursuing vocational training or college degrees or are uncertain about their future, these young men and women instead have chosen to dedicate themselves to military service in defense of our rights, our freedoms, and our country. They should know that they have full support of this Senate Chamber and the American people, who are with them in whatever challenges may lie ahead. These 461 young men and women are the cornerstone of our liberties. It is thanks to their dedication and the dedication of an untold number of patriots just like them that we are able to meet here today in the U.S. Senate and openly debate the best solutions to the many diverse problems that confront our country. It is thanks to their sacrifices that the United States of America remains a beacon of hope and freedom in a dangerous world. We are grateful to them, and we are grateful to their parents and their communities for instilling in them not only the mental and physical abilities our Armed Forces require but, more importantly, the character, the values, and the discipline that leads someone to put service to our Nation over self. I would like to personally thank these 461 graduating seniors for their selflessness and the courage that they have shown by volunteering to risk their lives in defense of our Nation. We owe them, along with all those who serve our country, a deep debt of gratitude. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of the 461 high school seniors.

Mr. President, I would like to honor Wyatt Zylawy, of Superior, MT, for his outstanding achievements in his recent Coast Guard training and for his noble commitment to serving our country. Wyatt is the youngest of three brothers who seem to do almost everything together--from playing the same sports, to playing in a band together, to eventually all joining the U.S. Coast Guard. Wyatt graduated from basic training on January 22, 2016, and won 3 out of 7 awards that were given out amongst the other 57 members in his unit. He received recognition for his high levels of academic and athletic abilities. To make this ceremony even more special, one of Wyatt's brothers, Roman, Junior, presented Wyatt with his awards. Currently Wyatt is attending a school in Yorktown, VA, where he is training to be an electrician's mate and will graduate on July 1, 2016. He has been named as the class leader and is responsible for overseeing his fellow officers' marching formations, ensuring their timeliness, and making sure they are keeping up with their physical training. His father, Roman Zylawy, describes Wyatt as always being a hard worker, highly motivated, and taking the initiative with his schoolwork, as well as any sports teams he played on. ``Whenever he set his mind on something, he did it and he did it well,'' Mr. Zylawy remarks. ``Wyatt has a high ability to excel and to consistently be on top of his game.'' Wyatt hopes to be stationed somewhere in the Pacific Northwest after graduation so he will be close to home. Good luck in all your endeavors, Wyatt, and I thank you for your current and future service to our State and to our Nation. You are a true representation of the brave, honorable, and exceptional type of young person who is the future of our State and country, and to that end, I am immensely grateful. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2385] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ TRIBUTE TO WYATT ZYLAWY Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, today, I applaud the Marian University Knights on earning USA Cycling's No. 1 collegiate cycling team ranking for the 2014-2015 season, as well as winning the 2015-2016 USA Cycling Collegiate Division I Track, Cyclo-cross, and BMX National Championships. Marian University established its cycling program in 1992. The program is committed to competing at the highest level and developing strong character in each team member through academic and athletic excellence. Since the inception of its competitive cycling program, the Marian University Knights have won 33 national championship titles in road, cyclo-cross, track, and BMX cycling. Head Coach Dean Peterson and his staff promote the University's goals by bringing team-focused concepts to a sport that traditionally emphasizes the individual. Peterson leads the team with a school-first philosophy, reminding student-athletes that they are students first and that being a responsible citizen and community member is as important as being a top-notch cyclist. It is this philosophy that serves as the cornerstone for the cycling team's three straight--2013, 2014, 2015-- USA Cycling Club of the Year awards, which evaluates not only on-bike performance, but team GPA, retention, postgraduation success, and community engagement. The Marian University Cycling Team is also giving back to the local and national cycling community, as well as the Indianapolis area, by hosting informal riding clinics, cycling for charity, and participating in campus volunteer opportunities.

The advanced health care this facility provides to our citizens is invaluable to northern Nevada, bringing an improved quality of life to children who are disabled or chronically ill and, in turn, the lives of their parents as well. Dr. Aryel founded Reno Center for Child and Adolescent Health in January of 2010. Prior to that, he served as a pediatrician and disaster response officer for the Public Health Service, treating patients in a variety of settings, including private offices, emergency rooms, psychiatric treatment centers, homes, field hospitals, and at the rear of utility vehicles in national emergency situations. During the 1999 North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit, he served on a team that included a disaster response unit and the U.S. Marine Corps Chemical Biological Incidence Response Force Unit, protecting the U.S. President from radiological chemical and biological threats. In addition, he has volunteered as a clinical supervisor at the University of Nevada, Reno Student Outreach Clinic and served on the board of directors for Project Restart in Reno. Dr. Aryel has received a number of accolades, including the 2008 Good Neighbor Award from Kansas City, MO, Reno Center for Child and Adolescent Health and was also recognized with a Silver Syringe Award for its significantly high vaccination rates. Dr. Aryel's unwavering dedication to bringing first-class medical care to [[Page S2387]] those around him goes without question. I am grateful to have him working to help those in need in the Silver State, and I extend my deepest gratitude for all he has done to help Nevada's youth. Reno Center for Child and Adolescent Health offers preventive and medical care to infants, children, adolescents, and young adults who require attention for serious or life-threatening illnesses and disabilities, as well as those requiring complex health care management. The facility is truly one of a kind in that it welcomes all children, including those with extremely difficult medical cases, and has the highest quantity of chronically and seriously ill children and adolescents in northern Nevada. Those leading the way at the center, including Dr. Aryel, are truly role models, demonstrating a genuine concern in improving the health and well-being of Nevada's future generations. Our State is fortunate to have a facility like this available to those in need. I am both humbled and honored to acknowledge Dr. Aryel for his outstanding work, especially for what he has done for families throughout northern Nevada, and I wish him the best of luck in all of his future endeavors.

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgS2387,CREC-2016-04-21,114,RECOGNIZING DELTA CONTRACT INTERIORS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2387] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING DELTA CONTRACT INTERIORS Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in recent weeks our State has faced disastrous storms and flooding, but with true Louisiana strength, families and communities are already banding together for the recovery. In that spirit, I would like to recognize Delta Contract Interiors as Small Business of the Week, whose community has rallied together to respond to and recover from the recent storms. In 1976, John and Martha Peters founded Delta Contract Interiors in their hometown of Homer in northwest Louisiana with the goal of providing quality interior design services and unique gifts to clients in their community. Offering additional services in custom drapery and design in their factory in Homer, they produce draperies, hospital curtains, blinds, and other items for hotels and hospitals nationwide, from Massachusetts to Washington to California to Florida. One of their most well-known project was providing the interior designs for the historic Waldorf Astoria hotel in New Orleans. Today, the company boasts a statewide and nationwide clientele, largely due to their commitment to personally measuring, producing, and installing each order that many large corporations sometimes cannot provide. The company has earned a reputation among large hotel brands, enabling Delta Contract Interiors to grow and employ more and more local workers in their manufacturing factory. In the aftermath of a strong upper level storm system that brought dangerous thunderstorms and flooding across Louisiana this month, the Peters found themselves in a seemingly impossible situation: their life's business was literally underwater. The Homer community came together to help the Peters recover all undamaged products and remove what had been destroyed by the rising water.

Mr. President, in recent weeks our State has faced disastrous storms and flooding, but with true Louisiana strength, families and communities are already banding together for the recovery. In that spirit, I would like to recognize Delta Contract Interiors as Small Business of the Week, whose community has rallied together to respond to and recover from the recent storms. In 1976, John and Martha Peters founded Delta Contract Interiors in their hometown of Homer in northwest Louisiana with the goal of providing quality interior design services and unique gifts to clients in their community. Offering additional services in custom drapery and design in their factory in Homer, they produce draperies, hospital curtains, blinds, and other items for hotels and hospitals nationwide, from Massachusetts to Washington to California to Florida. One of their most well-known project was providing the interior designs for the historic Waldorf Astoria hotel in New Orleans. Today, the company boasts a statewide and nationwide clientele, largely due to their commitment to personally measuring, producing, and installing each order that many large corporations sometimes cannot provide. The company has earned a reputation among large hotel brands, enabling Delta Contract Interiors to grow and employ more and more local workers in their manufacturing factory. In the aftermath of a strong upper level storm system that brought dangerous thunderstorms and flooding across Louisiana this month, the Peters found themselves in a seemingly impossible situation: their life's business was literally underwater. The Homer community came together to help the Peters recover all undamaged products and remove what had been destroyed by the rising water. With friends, family, and neighbors coming to their aid, the Peters have been inspired to pick up the pieces and rebuild their small business. In the next several months, countless businesses like Delta Contract Interiors will put the pieces of their businesses back together again with the help of family, friends, and neighbors.

Mr. President, I am proud to recognize and congratulate the University of North Dakota, UND, men's hockey team for winning the 2016 National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, Frozen Four Division I Men's Hockey National Championship. I was proud to join my colleague from North Dakota, Senator John Hoeven, in sponsoring an adopted resolution honoring the hard work of the men's hockey team and commending UND students, fans, and alumni for their tremendous support throughout the 2015-16 season. On April 9, 2016, the UND men's hockey team won the men's hockey national championship game held in Tampa, FL, defeating the Quinnipiac University Bobcats of Connecticut by a score of 5-to-1. The hockey team, under the leadership of athletic director Brian Faison and Coach Brad Berry, had an incredible season with a record of 34-6-4, which culminated in UND winning its eighth Division I men's hockey national championship. Coach Berry also became the first head coach to win a Division I men's hockey national championship in a head coach's inaugural season. Coach Berry and his staff have instilled character and perseverance in the UND players and have done an outstanding job with the UND hockey program. Under the university's leadership, UND has worked to support and further both academic and athletic excellence, so students have the opportunity to excel in the classroom as well as in sports. I am excited that thousands of UND fans attended the championship game to support the Fighting Hawks, reflecting the tremendous fan base of the University of North Dakota and highlighting the spirit and dedication of UND hockey fans. The enthusiasm and steadfast support of the fans has helped propel the team's success. Year after year, the UND men's hockey team has provided the Nation a glimpse of North Dakota values: playing honestly with heart, determination, and sportsmanship. This year, Coach Berry and his team of hard-working young men strengthened UND's proud legacy of dedication and respect for the game. The 2016 NCAA Frozen Four Division I Men's Hockey National Championship was a victory not only for the UND men's hockey team, but for the entire State of North Dakota. As UND looks to the future, I look forward to seeing the Fighting Hawks hockey program build on this moment of excellence to strengthen the school's already proud legacy. Congratulations again to all involved who made this national championship possible, and thank you for your hard work and service to the University of North Dakota and our great State. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2386] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA MEN'S HOCKEY TEAM Ms. HEITKAMP.

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgS2389,CREC-2016-04-21,114,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2389-S2393] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. REED (for himself and Mrs. Capito): S. 2835. A bill to amend the National Dam Safety Program Act to establish a program to provide grant assistance for the rehabilitation and repair of high hazard potential dams, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing, along with Senator Capito, the High Hazard Potential Small Dam Safety Act. This legislation seeks to provide grant assistance for the rehabilitation and repair of non-Federal high hazard potential dams. High hazard potential dams are those dams where failure is probable to cause loss of human life and endanger population centers and ecosystems, especially in periods of extreme weather and flooding. According to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, ASDSO, the number of high-hazard potential dams increased nationally from 9,281 in 1998 to more than 14,700 in 2013. In testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, on February 10, 2016, the president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, ASCE, Norma Jean Mattei, indicated that the average age of dams in the United States is 52 years, and she called for a dam rehabilitation program to address this growing problem. In Rhode Island, we have dozens of high hazard potential dams in need of rehabilitation, many of which date back to the nineteenth century. Currently, there is no Federal program to assist states with the repair or removal of non-agricultural, non-hydroelectric, non-Federal high hazard potential small dams. Such a program does exist to address dams built by the Department of Agriculture, but this leaves many dams vulnerable and some states without the ability to address the risks posed by small dams whose failure would likely result in the loss of human life. The bill Senator Capito and I are introducing today expands FEMA's existing National Dam Safety Program to allow non-Federal entities to apply for [[Page S2390]] matching grants for the repair and removal of non-Federal, non- agricultural, non-hydroelectric small dams that have been identified by a state dam safety agency as a high hazard potential. The program is non-mandatory, allowing states to determine which, if any, dams they would submit for assistance. The allocation of funds is based on a one- third equal distribution and 2/3 need-based formula, with a 65-35 percent cost share, to ensure the participation of a wide number of states. This legislation builds upon a bipartisan bill introduced in the 110th Congress by our former colleague, Senator Akaka of Hawaii, of which I was a cosponsor. By assisting in the repair or removal of high hazard dams before they fail, the bill makes an investment in future cost savings, not to mention lives and property saved. Estimates show that one dollar of pre-disaster mitigation spending can save between $3-$14 in post- disaster spending. This bipartisan bill, which is supported by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials and the American Society of Civil Engineers, will improve dam safety across the Nation. I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders as well as Senator Capito and our colleagues to pass the High Hazard Potential Small Dam Safety Act. ______ By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Franken, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Coons, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Vitter): S. 2840. A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize COPS grantees to use grant funds for active shooter training, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. CORNYN.. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 2840 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Our Lives by Initiating COPS Expansion Act of 2016'' or the ``POLICE Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED USE OF COPS FUNDS. Section 1701(b) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd(b)) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (16), by striking ``and'' at the end; (2) by redesignating paragraph (17) as paragraph (18); (3) by inserting after paragraph (16) the following: ``(17) to participate in nationally recognized active shooter training programs that offer scenario-based, integrated response courses designed to counter active shooter threats or acts of terrorism against individuals or facilities; and''; and (4) in paragraph (18), as redesignated, by striking ``(16)'' and inserting ``(17)''. ______ By Mr. NELSON (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Warren, Mr. Franken, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Gillibrand): S. 2843. A bill to provide emergency supplemental appropriations to address the Zika crisis; to the Committee on Appropriations. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to announce that Senator Reid of Nevada and I will be introducing legislation that is the President's emergency funding request to respond to the Zika virus. I have been on the floor many times talking about the ravages of the Zika virus. It is up to 91 cases in my State of Florida. Fortunately, none of them originated in the State. It is all because of a mosquito bite or some other means of transmission, such as sexual contact, that has been done outside of Florida. That is particularly true in the warmer climates of the Caribbean, Central America, and Latin America. We know the devastating consequences of someone getting this virus-- not as a virus, because it has the effects of a mild flu, but if a mosquito infects a pregnant woman, the researchers understand that if it is any time during the 9 months of the pregnancy, it has the disastrous consequences of severe deformities. What is the result of that? The result is not only trauma to the family involved, enormous tragedy, but look at what the social cost is going to be. The World Health Organization declares this a public health emergency of international concern. The last time the World Health Organization declared such an emergency was for Ebola. Last week our CDC announced that it is ``scarier than they had initially thought'' and that it could be linked to other birth defects, not just the shrunken head and brain that is so horrendous to see pictures of. This isn't just in Florida; 800 Americans in 40 States and territories have been infected. Of course, my State, with 91 cases, has been hit the hardest, and it has spread across 15 counties. The three most recent cases were in the Miami area, and in Florida it includes five pregnant women. Now we are going into the warmer summer months, and this is when the mosquitos breed all the more. This particular mosquito carries the dengue virus, which has its own drastic consequences. This mosquito is all over Puerto Rico. There is an estimate that 20 percent of the population of Puerto Rico may eventually be infected. If that is the case, you can wonder, out of that 20 percent of the population, how many are pregnant women. In a territory of the United States where American citizens reside, you can start to see the extreme depravity and social cost that will result, all at the same time that Puerto Rico is going through this tremendous financial crisis. Yesterday I spoke at length to Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Finance Committee. I believe he and his staff director are quite sincere about trying to do something about the financial condition of Puerto Rico, but now, on top of that, this additional plague is added. At the end of the day, we have to do whatever we can to help Puerto Rico in its financial crisis but now especially to help curb the spread of this virus. It is also in Haiti. It just so happens that we have a large Haitian American population in Florida. It is particularly running rampant throughout South America, including Brazil. Guess what is going to happen this summer. The Olympics will be in Brazil, and people from all over the world will be going. It is time to address this problem head-on with the administration's request for $1.9 billion in emergency funding. There are rumors that the Appropriations Committee is looking at a figure of $1.1 billion by stripping out the $250 million that would go through CMS because of the Federal Medicaid assistance increase to support Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program. What have I just said? They are already in crisis, their Medicaid funds have already been cut, and now we are not going to give this assistance to a population where 20 percent is going to be infected? The Appropriations Committee shouldn't cut out that $250 million. There is also the rumor that the Appropriations Committee is going to cut out some $589 million of the request that would go back to replenish the Ebola crisis fund; that in order to meet the emergency, the administration took that money--just under $600 million--over to address the Zika crisis until we can get off our duffs here in Congress and appropriate the emergency appropriations. I hope the Appropriations Committee will think twice before they cut out the money for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and replenishing the Ebola fund. That crisis still goes on, but the success of our being able to get on the Ebola crisis from 2 years ago is why we need to receive that added source to stop it. Otherwise, the consequences will be that the Ebola crisis will come back to the United States. This is truly an emergency. I am calling on our colleagues to approve the President's $1.9 billion emergency funding request now, in the immediate future, not later. The cost of inaction would be great and the consequences devastating. We don't want to have to say in the future: I told you so. I am introducing this legislation. More than likely, it will later be considered possibly as a stand-alone bill but possibly also as an amendment to one of these appropriations bills.

A bill to amend the National Dam Safety Program Act to establish a program to provide grant assistance for the rehabilitation and repair of high hazard potential dams, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing, along with Senator Capito, the High Hazard Potential Small Dam Safety Act. This legislation seeks to provide grant assistance for the rehabilitation and repair of non-Federal high hazard potential dams. High hazard potential dams are those dams where failure is probable to cause loss of human life and endanger population centers and ecosystems, especially in periods of extreme weather and flooding. According to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, ASDSO, the number of high-hazard potential dams increased nationally from 9,281 in 1998 to more than 14,700 in 2013. In testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, on February 10, 2016, the president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, ASCE, Norma Jean Mattei, indicated that the average age of dams in the United States is 52 years, and she called for a dam rehabilitation program to address this growing problem. In Rhode Island, we have dozens of high hazard potential dams in need of rehabilitation, many of which date back to the nineteenth century. Currently, there is no Federal program to assist states with the repair or removal of non-agricultural, non-hydroelectric, non-Federal high hazard potential small dams. Such a program does exist to address dams built by the Department of Agriculture, but this leaves many dams vulnerable and some states without the ability to address the risks posed by small dams whose failure would likely result in the loss of human life. The bill Senator Capito and I are introducing today expands FEMA's existing National Dam Safety Program to allow non-Federal entities to apply for [[Page S2390]] matching grants for the repair and removal of non-Federal, non- agricultural, non-hydroelectric small dams that have been identified by a state dam safety agency as a high hazard potential. The program is non-mandatory, allowing states to determine which, if any, dams they would submit for assistance. The allocation of funds is based on a one- third equal distribution and 2/3 need-based formula, with a 65-35 percent cost share, to ensure the participation of a wide number of states. This legislation builds upon a bipartisan bill introduced in the 110th Congress by our former colleague, Senator Akaka of Hawaii, of which I was a cosponsor. By assisting in the repair or removal of high hazard dams before they fail, the bill makes an investment in future cost savings, not to mention lives and property saved. Estimates show that one dollar of pre-disaster mitigation spending can save between $3-$14 in post- disaster spending. This bipartisan bill, which is supported by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials and the American Society of Civil Engineers, will improve dam safety across the Nation. I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders as well as Senator Capito and our colleagues to pass the High Hazard Potential Small Dam Safety Act. ______ By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Franken, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Coons, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Vitter): S. 2840. A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize COPS grantees to use grant funds for active shooter training, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. CORNYN.. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 2840 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Our Lives by Initiating COPS Expansion Act of 2016'' or the ``POLICE Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED USE OF COPS FUNDS. Section 1701(b) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd(b)) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (16), by striking ``and'' at the end; (2) by redesignating paragraph (17) as paragraph (18); (3) by inserting after paragraph (16) the following: ``(17) to participate in nationally recognized active shooter training programs that offer scenario-based, integrated response courses designed to counter active shooter threats or acts of terrorism against individuals or facilities; and''; and (4) in paragraph (18), as redesignated, by striking ``(16)'' and inserting ``(17)''. ______ By Mr. NELSON (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Warren, Mr. Franken, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Gillibrand): S. 2843. A bill to provide emergency supplemental appropriations to address the Zika crisis; to the Committee on Appropriations. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to announce that Senator Reid of Nevada and I will be introducing legislation that is the President's emergency funding request to respond to the Zika virus. I have been on the floor many times talking about the ravages of the Zika virus. It is up to 91 cases in my State of Florida. Fortunately, none of them originated in the State. It is all because of a mosquito bite or some other means of transmission, such as sexual contact, that has been done outside of Florida. That is particularly true in the warmer climates of the Caribbean, Central America, and Latin America. We know the devastating consequences of someone getting this virus-- not as a virus, because it has the effects of a mild flu, but if a mosquito infects a pregnant woman, the researchers understand that if it is any time during the 9 months of the pregnancy, it has the disastrous consequences of severe deformities. What is the result of that? The result is not only trauma to the family involved, enormous tragedy, but look at what the social cost is going to be. The World Health Organization declares this a public health emergency of international concern. The last time the World Health Organization declared such an emergency was for Ebola. Last week our CDC announced that it is ``scarier than they had initially thought'' and that it could be linked to other birth defects, not just the shrunken head and brain that is so horrendous to see pictures of. This isn't just in Florida; 800 Americans in 40 States and territories have been infected. Of course, my State, with 91 cases, has been hit the hardest, and it has spread across 15 counties. The three most recent cases were in the Miami area, and in Florida it includes five pregnant women. Now we are going into the warmer summer months, and this is when the mosquitos breed all the more. This particular mosquito carries the dengue virus, which has its own drastic consequences. This mosquito is all over Puerto Rico. There is an estimate that 20 percent of the population of Puerto Rico may eventually be infected. If that is the case, you can wonder, out of that 20 percent of the population, how many are pregnant women. In a territory of the United States where American citizens reside, you can start to see the extreme depravity and social cost that will result, all at the same time that Puerto Rico is going through this tremendous financial crisis. Yesterday I spoke at length to Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Finance Committee. I believe he and his staff director are quite sincere about trying to do something about the financial condition of Puerto Rico, but now, on top of that, this additional plague is added. At the end of the day, we have to do whatever we can to help Puerto Rico in its financial crisis but now especially to help curb the spread of this virus. It is also in Haiti. It just so happens that we have a large Haitian American population in Florida. It is particularly running rampant throughout South America, including Brazil. Guess what is going to happen this summer. The Olympics will be in Brazil, and people from all over the world will be going. It is time to address this problem head-on with the administration's request for $1.9 billion in emergency funding. There are rumors that the Appropriations Committee is looking at a figure of $1.1 billion by stripping out the $250 million that would go through CMS because of the Federal Medicaid assistance increase to support Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program. What have I just said? They are already in crisis, their Medicaid funds have already been cut, and now we are not going to give this assistance to a population where 20 percent is going to be infected? The Appropriations Committee shouldn't cut out that $250 million. There is also the rumor that the Appropriations Committee is going to cut out some $589 million of the request that would go back to replenish the Ebola crisis fund; that in order to meet the emergency, the administration took that money--just under $600 million--over to address the Zika crisis until we can get off our duffs here in Congress and appropriate the emergency appropriations. I hope the Appropriations Committee will think twice before they cut out the money for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and replenishing the Ebola fund. That crisis still goes on, but the success of our being able to get on the Ebola crisis from 2 years ago is why we need to receive that added source to stop it. Otherwise, the consequences will be that the Ebola crisis will come back to the United States. This is truly an emergency. I am calling on our colleagues to approve the President's $1.9 billion emergency funding request now, in the immediate future, not later. The cost of inaction would be great and the consequences devastating. We don't want to have to say in the future: I told you so. I am introducing this legislation. More than likely, it will later be considered possibly as a stand-alone bill but possibly also as an amendment to one of these appropriations bills. I urge our colleagues to support this $1.9 billion emergency assistance request. [[Page S2391]] Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.

A bill to amend the National Dam Safety Program Act to establish a program to provide grant assistance for the rehabilitation and repair of high hazard potential dams, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing, along with Senator Capito, the High Hazard Potential Small Dam Safety Act. This legislation seeks to provide grant assistance for the rehabilitation and repair of non-Federal high hazard potential dams. High hazard potential dams are those dams where failure is probable to cause loss of human life and endanger population centers and ecosystems, especially in periods of extreme weather and flooding. According to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, ASDSO, the number of high-hazard potential dams increased nationally from 9,281 in 1998 to more than 14,700 in 2013. In testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, on February 10, 2016, the president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, ASCE, Norma Jean Mattei, indicated that the average age of dams in the United States is 52 years, and she called for a dam rehabilitation program to address this growing problem. In Rhode Island, we have dozens of high hazard potential dams in need of rehabilitation, many of which date back to the nineteenth century. Currently, there is no Federal program to assist states with the repair or removal of non-agricultural, non-hydroelectric, non-Federal high hazard potential small dams. Such a program does exist to address dams built by the Department of Agriculture, but this leaves many dams vulnerable and some states without the ability to address the risks posed by small dams whose failure would likely result in the loss of human life. The bill Senator Capito and I are introducing today expands FEMA's existing National Dam Safety Program to allow non-Federal entities to apply for [[Page S2390]] matching grants for the repair and removal of non-Federal, non- agricultural, non-hydroelectric small dams that have been identified by a state dam safety agency as a high hazard potential. The program is non-mandatory, allowing states to determine which, if any, dams they would submit for assistance. The allocation of funds is based on a one- third equal distribution and 2/3 need-based formula, with a 65-35 percent cost share, to ensure the participation of a wide number of states. This legislation builds upon a bipartisan bill introduced in the 110th Congress by our former colleague, Senator Akaka of Hawaii, of which I was a cosponsor. By assisting in the repair or removal of high hazard dams before they fail, the bill makes an investment in future cost savings, not to mention lives and property saved. Estimates show that one dollar of pre-disaster mitigation spending can save between $3-$14 in post- disaster spending. This bipartisan bill, which is supported by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials and the American Society of Civil Engineers, will improve dam safety across the Nation. I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders as well as Senator Capito and our colleagues to pass the High Hazard Potential Small Dam Safety Act. ______ By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Franken, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Coons, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Vitter): S. 2840. A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize COPS grantees to use grant funds for active shooter training, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. CORNYN.. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 2840 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Our Lives by Initiating COPS Expansion Act of 2016'' or the ``POLICE Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED USE OF COPS FUNDS. Section 1701(b) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd(b)) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (16), by striking ``and'' at the end; (2) by redesignating paragraph (17) as paragraph (18); (3) by inserting after paragraph (16) the following: ``(17) to participate in nationally recognized active shooter training programs that offer scenario-based, integrated response courses designed to counter active shooter threats or acts of terrorism against individuals or facilities; and''; and (4) in paragraph (18), as redesignated, by striking ``(16)'' and inserting ``(17)''. ______ By Mr. NELSON (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Warren, Mr. Franken, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Gillibrand): S. 2843. A bill to provide emergency supplemental appropriations to address the Zika crisis; to the Committee on Appropriations. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to announce that Senator Reid of Nevada and I will be introducing legislation that is the President's emergency funding request to respond to the Zika virus. I have been on the floor many times talking about the ravages of the Zika virus. It is up to 91 cases in my State of Florida. Fortunately, none of them originated in the State. It is all because of a mosquito bite or some other means of transmission, such as sexual contact, that has been done outside of Florida. That is particularly true in the warmer climates of the Caribbean, Central America, and Latin America. We know the devastating consequences of someone getting this virus-- not as a virus, because it has the effects of a mild flu, but if a mosquito infects a pregnant woman, the researchers understand that if it is any time during the 9 months of the pregnancy, it has the disastrous consequences of severe deformities. What is the result of that? The result is not only trauma to the family involved, enormous tragedy, but look at what the social cost is going to be. The World Health Organization declares this a public health emergency of international concern. The last time the World Health Organization declared such an emergency was for Ebola. Last week our CDC announced that it is ``scarier than they had initially thought'' and that it could be linked to other birth defects, not just the shrunken head and brain that is so horrendous to see pictures of. This isn't just in Florida; 800 Americans in 40 States and territories have been infected. Of course, my State, with 91 cases, has been hit the hardest, and it has spread across 15 counties. The three most recent cases were in the Miami area, and in Florida it includes five pregnant women. Now we are going into the warmer summer months, and this is when the mosquitos breed all the more. This particular mosquito carries the dengue virus, which has its own drastic consequences. This mosquito is all over Puerto Rico. There is an estimate that 20 percent of the population of Puerto Rico may eventually be infected. If that is the case, you can wonder, out of that 20 percent of the population, how many are pregnant women. In a territory of the United States where American citizens reside, you can start to see the extreme depravity and social cost that will result, all at the same time that Puerto Rico is going through this tremendous financial crisis. Yesterday I spoke at length to Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Finance Committee. I believe he and his staff director are quite sincere about trying to do something about the financial condition of Puerto Rico, but now, on top of that, this additional plague is added. At the end of the day, we have to do whatever we can to help Puerto Rico in its financial crisis but now especially to help curb the spread of this virus. It is also in Haiti. It just so happens that we have a large Haitian American population in Florida. It is particularly running rampant throughout South America, including Brazil. Guess what is going to happen this summer. The Olympics will be in Brazil, and people from all over the world will be going. It is time to address this problem head-on with the administration's request for $1.9 billion in emergency funding. There are rumors that the Appropriations Committee is looking at a figure of $1.1 billion by stripping out the $250 million that would go through CMS because of the Federal Medicaid assistance increase to support Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program. What have I just said? They are already in crisis, their Medicaid funds have already been cut, and now we are not going to give this assistance to a population where 20 percent is going to be infected? The Appropriations Committee shouldn't cut out that $250 million. There is also the rumor that the Appropriations Committee is going to cut out some $589 million of the request that would go back to replenish the Ebola crisis fund; that in order to meet the emergency, the administration took that money--just under $600 million--over to address the Zika crisis until we can get off our duffs here in Congress and appropriate the emergency appropriations. I hope the Appropriations Committee will think twice before they cut out the money for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and replenishing the Ebola fund. That crisis still goes on, but the success of our being able to get on the Ebola crisis from 2 years ago is why we need to receive that added source to stop it. Otherwise, the consequences will be that the Ebola crisis will come back to the United States. This is truly an emergency. I am calling on our colleagues to approve the President's $1.9 billion emergency funding request now, in the immediate future, not later. The cost of inaction would be great and the consequences devastating. We don't want to have to say in the future: I told you so. I am introducing this legislation. More than likely, it will later be considered possibly as a stand-alone bill but possibly also as an amendment to one of these appropriations bills. I urge our colleagues to support this $1.9 billion emergency assistance request. [[Page S2391]] Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.

to the committee on environment and public works. mr. reed. mr. president, i am pleased to be introducing, along with senator capito, the high hazard potential small dam safety act. this legislation seeks to provide grant assistance for the rehabilitation and repair of non-federal high hazard potential dams. high hazard potential dams are those dams where failure is probable to cause loss of human life and endanger population centers and ecosystems, especially in periods of extreme weather and flooding. according to the association of state dam safety officials, asdso, the number of high-hazard potential dams increased nationally from 9,281 in 1998 to more than 14,700 in 2013. in testimony before the senate committee on environment and public works, on february 10, 2016, the president of the american society of civil engineers, asce, norma jean mattei, indicated that the average age of dams in the united states is 52 years, and she called for a dam rehabilitation program to address this growing problem. in rhode island, we have dozens of high hazard potential dams in need of rehabilitation, many of which date back to the nineteenth century. currently, there is no federal program to assist states with the repair or removal of non-agricultural, non-hydroelectric, non-federal high hazard potential small dams. such a program does exist to address dams built by the department of agriculture, but this leaves many dams vulnerable and some states without the ability to address the risks posed by small dams whose failure would likely result in the loss of human life. the bill senator capito and i are introducing today expands fema's existing national dam safety program to allow non-federal entities to apply for [[page s2390]] matching grants for the repair and removal of non-federal, non- agricultural, non-hydroelectric small dams that have been identified by a state dam safety agency as a high hazard potential. the program is non-mandatory, allowing states to determine which, if any, dams they would submit for assistance. the allocation of funds is based on a one- third equal distribution and 2/3 need-based formula, with a 65-35 percent cost share, to ensure the participation of a wide number of states. this legislation builds upon a bipartisan bill introduced in the 110th congress by our former colleague, senator akaka of hawaii, of which i was a cosponsor. by assisting in the repair or removal of high hazard dams before they fail, the bill makes an investment in future cost savings, not to mention lives and property saved. estimates show that one dollar of pre-disaster mitigation spending can save between $3-$14 in post- disaster spending. this bipartisan bill, which is supported by the association of state dam safety officials and the american society of civil engineers, will improve dam safety across the nation. i look forward to working with these and other stakeholders as well as senator capito and our colleagues to pass the high hazard potential small dam safety act. ______ by mr. cornyn (for himself, mr. leahy, mr. grassley, mr. franken, mr. hatch, mr. coons, mrs. feinstein, and mr. vitter): s. 2840. a bill to amend the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 to authorize cops grantees to use grant funds for active shooter training, and for other purposes; to the committee on the judiciary. mr. cornyn.. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record. there being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: s. 2840 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``protecting our lives by initiating cops expansion act of 2016'' or the ``police act of 2016''. sec. 2. additional authorized use of cops funds. section 1701(b) of title i of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 (42 u.s.c. 3796dd(b)) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (16), by striking ``and'' at the end; (2) by redesignating paragraph (17) as paragraph (18); (3) by inserting after paragraph (16) the following: ``(17) to participate in nationally recognized active shooter training programs that offer scenario-based, integrated response courses designed to counter active shooter threats or acts of terrorism against individuals or facilities; and''; and (4) in paragraph (18), as redesignated, by striking ``(16)'' and inserting ``(17)''. ______ by mr. nelson (for himself, mr. reid, mr. schumer, ms. hirono, ms. warren, mr. franken, mr. durbin, mrs. feinstein, mr. menendez, mr. reed, and mrs. gillibrand): s. 2843. a bill to provide emergency supplemental appropriations to address the zika crisis; to the committee on appropriations. mr. nelson. mr. president, i rise to announce that senator reid of nevada and i will be introducing legislation that is the president's emergency funding request to respond to the zika virus. i have been on the floor many times talking about the ravages of the zika virus. it is up to 91 cases in my state of florida. fortunately, none of them originated in the state. it is all because of a mosquito bite or some other means of transmission, such as sexual contact, that has been done outside of florida. that is particularly true in the warmer climates of the caribbean, central america, and latin america. we know the devastating consequences of someone getting this virus-- not as a virus, because it has the effects of a mild flu, but if a mosquito infects a pregnant woman, the researchers understand that if it is any time during the 9 months of the pregnancy, it has the disastrous consequences of severe deformities. what is the result of that? the result is not only trauma to the family involved, enormous tragedy, but look at what the social cost is going to be. the world health organization declares this a public health emergency of international concern. the last time the world health organization declared such an emergency was for ebola. last week our cdc announced that it is ``scarier than they had initially thought'' and that it could be linked to other birth defects, not just the shrunken head and brain that is so horrendous to see pictures of. this isn't just in florida; 800 americans in 40 states and territories have been infected. of course, my state, with 91 cases, has been hit the hardest, and it has spread across 15 counties. the three most recent cases were in the miami area, and in florida it includes five pregnant women. now we are going into the warmer summer months, and this is when the mosquitos breed all the more. this particular mosquito carries the dengue virus, which has its own drastic consequences. this mosquito is all over puerto rico. there is an estimate that 20 percent of the population of puerto rico may eventually be infected. if that is the case, you can wonder, out of that 20 percent of the population, how many are pregnant women. in a territory of the united states where american citizens reside, you can start to see the extreme depravity and social cost that will result, all at the same time that puerto rico is going through this tremendous financial crisis. yesterday i spoke at length to senator hatch, the chairman of the finance committee. i believe he and his staff director are quite sincere about trying to do something about the financial condition of puerto rico, but now, on top of that, this additional plague is added. at the end of the day, we have to do whatever we can to help puerto rico in its financial crisis but now especially to help curb the spread of this virus. it is also in haiti. it just so happens that we have a large haitian american population in florida. it is particularly running rampant throughout south america, including brazil. guess what is going to happen this summer. the olympics will be in brazil, and people from all over the world will be going. it is time to address this problem head-on with the administration's request for $1.9 billion in emergency funding. there are rumors that the appropriations committee is looking at a figure of $1.1 billion by stripping out the $250 million that would go through cms because of the federal medicaid assistance increase to support puerto rico's medicaid program. what have i just said? they are already in crisis, their medicaid funds have already been cut, and now we are not going to give this assistance to a population where 20 percent is going to be infected? the appropriations committee shouldn't cut out that $250 million. there is also the rumor that the appropriations committee is going to cut out some $589 million of the request that would go back to replenish the ebola crisis fund; that in order to meet the emergency, the administration took that money--just under $600 million--over to address the zika crisis until we can get off our duffs here in congress and appropriate the emergency appropriations. i hope the appropriations committee will think twice before they cut out the money for medicaid in puerto rico and replenishing the ebola fund. that crisis still goes on, but the success of our being able to get on the ebola crisis from 2 years ago is why we need to receive that added source to stop it. otherwise, the consequences will be that the ebola crisis will come back to the united states. this is truly an emergency. i am calling on our colleagues to approve the president's $1.9 billion emergency funding request now, in the immediate future, not later. the cost of inaction would be great and the consequences devastating. we don't want to have to say in the future: i told you so. i am introducing this legislation. more than likely, it will later be considered possibly as a stand-alone bill but possibly also as an amendment to one of these appropriations bills. i urge our colleagues to support this $1.9 billion emergency assistance request. [[page s2391]] mr. nelson. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record. there being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the

A bill to amend the National Dam Safety Program Act to establish a program to provide grant assistance for the rehabilitation and repair of high hazard potential dams, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing, along with Senator Capito, the High Hazard Potential Small Dam Safety Act. This legislation seeks to provide grant assistance for the rehabilitation and repair of non-Federal high hazard potential dams. High hazard potential dams are those dams where failure is probable to cause loss of human life and endanger population centers and ecosystems, especially in periods of extreme weather and flooding. According to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, ASDSO, the number of high-hazard potential dams increased nationally from 9,281 in 1998 to more than 14,700 in 2013. In testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, on February 10, 2016, the president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, ASCE, Norma Jean Mattei, indicated that the average age of dams in the United States is 52 years, and she called for a dam rehabilitation program to address this growing problem. In Rhode Island, we have dozens of high hazard potential dams in need of rehabilitation, many of which date back to the nineteenth century. Currently, there is no Federal program to assist states with the repair or removal of non-agricultural, non-hydroelectric, non-Federal high hazard potential small dams. Such a program does exist to address dams built by the Department of Agriculture, but this leaves many dams vulnerable and some states without the ability to address the risks posed by small dams whose failure would likely result in the loss of human life. The bill Senator Capito and I are introducing today expands FEMA's existing National Dam Safety Program to allow non-Federal entities to apply for [[Page S2390]] matching grants for the repair and removal of non-Federal, non- agricultural, non-hydroelectric small dams that have been identified by a state dam safety agency as a high hazard potential. The program is non-mandatory, allowing states to determine which, if any, dams they would submit for assistance. The allocation of funds is based on a one- third equal distribution and 2/3 need-based formula, with a 65-35 percent cost share, to ensure the participation of a wide number of states. This legislation builds upon a bipartisan bill introduced in the 110th Congress by our former colleague, Senator Akaka of Hawaii, of which I was a cosponsor. By assisting in the repair or removal of high hazard dams before they fail, the bill makes an investment in future cost savings, not to mention lives and property saved. Estimates show that one dollar of pre-disaster mitigation spending can save between $3-$14 in post- disaster spending. This bipartisan bill, which is supported by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials and the American Society of Civil Engineers, will improve dam safety across the Nation. I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders as well as Senator Capito and our colleagues to pass the High Hazard Potential Small Dam Safety Act. ______","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2389-S2390] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. REED (for himself and Mrs. Capito): S. 2835.

Res. 436 Whereas April 25 of each year is recognized internationally as World Malaria Day; Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in many developing countries, despite being preventable and treatable; Whereas fighting malaria is in the national interest of the United States, as reducing the risk of malaria protects members of the Armed Forces and other people of the United States serving overseas in malaria-endemic regions, and reducing malaria deaths helps to lower risks of instability in less developed countries; Whereas the elimination of malaria remains a bipartisan priority of the United States Government; [[Page S2394]] Whereas, on December 14, 2006, President George W. Bush stated at the White House Malaria Summit, ``So we are acting, and we're leading. And with partners across the world, we are helping the people of Africa turn the tide against malaria. The goal of defeating malaria is a challenging goal, yet it can be done. It's not going to require a miracle, it just requires a smart, sustained, focused effort.''; Whereas, on September 27, 2015, President Barack Obama stated at the United Nations General Assembly, ``Billions of our fellow human beings are at risk of dying from diseases that we know how to prevent. Many children are just 1 mosquito bite away from death. And that is a moral outrage. It is a profound injustice. It is literally a matter of life and death, and now the world must act.''; Whereas support for efforts to fight malaria is in the diplomatic and moral interest of the United States, as that support generates goodwill toward the United States and highlights the values of the people of the United States through the work of governmental, nongovernmental, and faith- based organizations of the United States; Whereas efforts to fight malaria are in the long-term economic interest of the United States because those efforts help developing countries-- (1) identify at-risk populations; (2) provide a framework for critical emergency disease treatment; (3) provide better health services; (4) increase local governance needed to address substandard and counterfeit medicines that exacerbate malaria resistance; (5) produce healthier and more productive workforces; (6) advance economic development; and (7) promote stronger trading partners; Whereas, in 2015, malaria transmission occurred in 95 countries and territories; Whereas an estimated 3,200,000,000 people are at risk for malaria, with 214,000,000 active cases, the vast majority of whom are in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 90 percent of malaria deaths in the world; Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to and disproportionately affected by malaria; Whereas malaria greatly affects the health of children, as children under the age of 5 account for an estimated 70 percent of malaria deaths each year; Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal and neonatal health, causing complications during delivery, anemia, and low birth weights, and estimates indicate that malaria infection causes approximately 400,000 cases of severe maternal anemia and between 75,000 and 200,000 infant deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa; Whereas heightened national, regional, and international efforts to prevent and treat malaria during recent years have made significant progress and helped save hundreds of thousands of lives; Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 by the World Health Organization states that, in 2014, approximately 55 percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa slept under an insecticide- treated mosquito net, and household surveys indicated that 90 percent of people used an insecticide-treated mosquito net if such a net was available in the household; Whereas, in 2014, approximately 116,000,000 people were protected by indoor residual spraying; Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 further states that, between 2000 and 2015-- (1) malaria mortality rates decreased by 60 percent around the world; (2) in the African Region of the World Health Organization, malaria mortality rates decreased by 66 percent; and (3) an estimated 6,200,000 malaria deaths were averted globally, primarily as a result of increased interventions; Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 further states that, out of 95 countries and territories with ongoing transmission of malaria in 2015-- (1) 10 countries are classified as being in the pre- elimination phase; (2) 10 countries are classified as being in the elimination phase; and (3) 9 countries are classified as being in the prevention of malaria reintroduction phase of malaria control; Whereas continued national, regional, and international investment in efforts to eliminate malaria, including prevention and treatment efforts, the development of a vaccine to immunize children from the malaria parasite, and advancements in insecticides, are critical in order to-- (1) continue to reduce malaria deaths; (2) prevent backsliding in areas where progress has been made; and (3) equip the United States and the global community with the tools necessary to fight malaria and other global health threats; Whereas the United States Government has played a leading role in the recent progress made toward reducing the global burden of malaria, particularly through the President's Malaria Initiative (referred to in this preamble as the ``PMI'') and the contribution of the United States to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; Whereas an independent, external evaluation, prepared by Boston University, examining 6 objectives of the PMI, found the PMI to be a successful, well-led program that has ``earned and deserves the task of sustaining and expanding the United States Government's response to global malaria control efforts''; Whereas the PMI Strategy 2015-2020 articulates the malaria goal of the United States Government of working with countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and substantially decrease malaria morbidity, towards the long- term goal of elimination;

(6) advance economic development; and (7) promote stronger trading partners; Whereas, in 2015, malaria transmission occurred in 95 countries and territories; Whereas an estimated 3,200,000,000 people are at risk for malaria, with 214,000,000 active cases, the vast majority of whom are in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 90 percent of malaria deaths in the world; Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to and disproportionately affected by malaria; Whereas malaria greatly affects the health of children, as children under the age of 5 account for an estimated 70 percent of malaria deaths each year; Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal and neonatal health, causing complications during delivery, anemia, and low birth weights, and estimates indicate that malaria infection causes approximately 400,000 cases of severe maternal anemia and between 75,000 and 200,000 infant deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa; Whereas heightened national, regional, and international efforts to prevent and treat malaria during recent years have made significant progress and helped save hundreds of thousands of lives; Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 by the World Health Organization states that, in 2014, approximately 55 percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa slept under an insecticide- treated mosquito net, and household surveys indicated that 90 percent of people used an insecticide-treated mosquito net if such a net was available in the household; Whereas, in 2014, approximately 116,000,000 people were protected by indoor residual spraying; Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 further states that, between 2000 and 2015-- (1) malaria mortality rates decreased by 60 percent around the world; (2) in the African Region of the World Health Organization, malaria mortality rates decreased by 66 percent; and (3) an estimated 6,200,000 malaria deaths were averted globally, primarily as a result of increased interventions;

(2) 10 countries are classified as being in the elimination phase; and (3) 9 countries are classified as being in the prevention of malaria reintroduction phase of malaria control; Whereas continued national, regional, and international investment in efforts to eliminate malaria, including prevention and treatment efforts, the development of a vaccine to immunize children from the malaria parasite, and advancements in insecticides, are critical in order to-- (1) continue to reduce malaria deaths;

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution to designate May 21, 2016, as Kids to Parks Day. From the Painted Hills to Crater Lake and from Mt. Hood to the Oregon Caves, nature has given Oregon many wondrous treasures in every corner of my State. As a whole, Oregon boasts some of the most beautiful landscapes, varied ecosystems, and unrivaled outdoor recreation opportunities in the nation. Given Oregon's unmatched scenery, enjoying the outdoors is imbedded in the DNA of Oregonians, and opportunities to get outside and enjoy our treasures brings in visitors from all over the world. Kids to Parks Day builds on Oregon's outdoor culture, inspiring children and families to spend time together, enjoy nature and parks, and recreate on public lands across the country. Over 70,000 people have pledged to participate in this year's Kids to Parks Day, and over 200 cities have proclaimed May 21 as the day in which to celebrate Those who choose to celebrate Kids to Parks Day will find that communities all across the country offer a variety of natural resources and public lands--often with free access--that promote healthy outdoor recreation and empower young people to become stewards of the environment. I am pleased to be joined on this resolution by my colleague from Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch, who has worked with me over the years to promote healthy recreation. This resolution promotes the values of healthy outdoor recreation and environmental stewardship, for kids of all ages, by encouraging them to get outside and visit local parks and public lands. Research shows that outdoor recreation has positive impacts on children's performance in school and their overall health. In addition, when kids have a connection to nature, they are more likely to get involved in efforts to preserve public lands for future generations of young conservationists. This resolution--designating Kids to Parks Day--is about more than just one day of recreation. It is about promoting the year-round use of parks and public lands by kids and their families. While National Parks are the crown jewels of this country's parks system, State and neighborhood parks serve as important year-round conduits to the outdoors, attracting the everyday dog walker, jogger, and birdwatcher. Neighborhood parks are easily accessible, and can broaden the appreciation for nature and the outdoors in young people, while fostering a safe setting for healthy adventure. Local parks and the miles of trails on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land, not to mention the widely-used reservoirs managed by the Army Corps of Engineers, are the backbone that supports recreation and access to public lands all across the country. Kids to Parks Day recognizes the significance of all open spaces and the need to preserve these areas for the health and education of young people. Today, I am pleased to celebrate the importance of our public lands and the importance of recreation. I want to take this time to encourage children and their families to spend time in the outdoors and celebrate Kids to Parks Day on Saturday, May 21, 2016. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2393] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS ______ SENATE RESOLUTION 435--DESIGNATING MAY 21, 2016, AS ``KIDS TO PARKS DAY'' Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Booker, Mr. Heinrich, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Hirono, and Mr. Alexander) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary: S.

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgS2390-2,CREC-2016-04-21,114,Introductory Statement on S. 2843,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2390-S2393] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. NELSON (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Warren, Mr. Franken, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Gillibrand): S. 2843. A bill to provide emergency supplemental appropriations to address the Zika crisis; to the Committee on Appropriations. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to announce that Senator Reid of Nevada and I will be introducing legislation that is the President's emergency funding request to respond to the Zika virus. I have been on the floor many times talking about the ravages of the Zika virus. It is up to 91 cases in my State of Florida. Fortunately, none of them originated in the State. It is all because of a mosquito bite or some other means of transmission, such as sexual contact, that has been done outside of Florida. That is particularly true in the warmer climates of the Caribbean, Central America, and Latin America. We know the devastating consequences of someone getting this virus-- not as a virus, because it has the effects of a mild flu, but if a mosquito infects a pregnant woman, the researchers understand that if it is any time during the 9 months of the pregnancy, it has the disastrous consequences of severe deformities. What is the result of that? The result is not only trauma to the family involved, enormous tragedy, but look at what the social cost is going to be. The World Health Organization declares this a public health emergency of international concern. The last time the World Health Organization declared such an emergency was for Ebola. Last week our CDC announced that it is ``scarier than they had initially thought'' and that it could be linked to other birth defects, not just the shrunken head and brain that is so horrendous to see pictures of. This isn't just in Florida; 800 Americans in 40 States and territories have been infected. Of course, my State, with 91 cases, has been hit the hardest, and it has spread across 15 counties. The three most recent cases were in the Miami area, and in Florida it includes five pregnant women. Now we are going into the warmer summer months, and this is when the mosquitos breed all the more. This particular mosquito carries the dengue virus, which has its own drastic consequences. This mosquito is all over Puerto Rico. There is an estimate that 20 percent of the population of Puerto Rico may eventually be infected. If that is the case, you can wonder, out of that 20 percent of the population, how many are pregnant women. In a territory of the United States where American citizens reside, you can start to see the extreme depravity and social cost that will result, all at the same time that Puerto Rico is going through this tremendous financial crisis. Yesterday I spoke at length to Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Finance Committee. I believe he and his staff director are quite sincere about trying to do something about the financial condition of Puerto Rico, but now, on top of that, this additional plague is added. At the end of the day, we have to do whatever we can to help Puerto Rico in its financial crisis but now especially to help curb the spread of this virus. It is also in Haiti. It just so happens that we have a large Haitian American population in Florida. It is particularly running rampant throughout South America, including Brazil. Guess what is going to happen this summer. The Olympics will be in Brazil, and people from all over the world will be going. It is time to address this problem head-on with the administration's request for $1.9 billion in emergency funding. There are rumors that the Appropriations Committee is looking at a figure of $1.1 billion by stripping out the $250 million that would go through CMS because of the Federal Medicaid assistance increase to support Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program. What have I just said? They are already in crisis, their Medicaid funds have already been cut, and now we are not going to give this assistance to a population where 20 percent is going to be infected? The Appropriations Committee shouldn't cut out that $250 million. There is also the rumor that the Appropriations Committee is going to cut out some $589 million of the request that would go back to replenish the Ebola crisis fund; that in order to meet the emergency, the administration took that money--just under $600 million--over to address the Zika crisis until we can get off our duffs here in Congress and appropriate the emergency appropriations. I hope the Appropriations Committee will think twice before they cut out the money for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and replenishing the Ebola fund. That crisis still goes on, but the success of our being able to get on the Ebola crisis from 2 years ago is why we need to receive that added source to stop it. Otherwise, the consequences will be that the Ebola crisis will come back to the United States. This is truly an emergency. I am calling on our colleagues to approve the President's $1.9 billion emergency funding request now, in the immediate future, not later. The cost of inaction would be great and the consequences devastating. We don't want to have to say in the future: I told you so. I am introducing this legislation. More than likely, it will later be considered possibly as a stand-alone bill but possibly also as an amendment to one of these appropriations bills. I urge our colleagues to support this $1.9 billion emergency assistance request. [[Page S2391]] Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.

A bill to provide emergency supplemental appropriations to address the Zika crisis; to the Committee on Appropriations. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to announce that Senator Reid of Nevada and I will be introducing legislation that is the President's emergency funding request to respond to the Zika virus. I have been on the floor many times talking about the ravages of the Zika virus. It is up to 91 cases in my State of Florida. Fortunately, none of them originated in the State. It is all because of a mosquito bite or some other means of transmission, such as sexual contact, that has been done outside of Florida. That is particularly true in the warmer climates of the Caribbean, Central America, and Latin America. We know the devastating consequences of someone getting this virus-- not as a virus, because it has the effects of a mild flu, but if a mosquito infects a pregnant woman, the researchers understand that if it is any time during the 9 months of the pregnancy, it has the disastrous consequences of severe deformities. What is the result of that? The result is not only trauma to the family involved, enormous tragedy, but look at what the social cost is going to be. The World Health Organization declares this a public health emergency of international concern. The last time the World Health Organization declared such an emergency was for Ebola. Last week our CDC announced that it is ``scarier than they had initially thought'' and that it could be linked to other birth defects, not just the shrunken head and brain that is so horrendous to see pictures of. This isn't just in Florida; 800 Americans in 40 States and territories have been infected. Of course, my State, with 91 cases, has been hit the hardest, and it has spread across 15 counties. The three most recent cases were in the Miami area, and in Florida it includes five pregnant women. Now we are going into the warmer summer months, and this is when the mosquitos breed all the more. This particular mosquito carries the dengue virus, which has its own drastic consequences. This mosquito is all over Puerto Rico. There is an estimate that 20 percent of the population of Puerto Rico may eventually be infected. If that is the case, you can wonder, out of that 20 percent of the population, how many are pregnant women. In a territory of the United States where American citizens reside, you can start to see the extreme depravity and social cost that will result, all at the same time that Puerto Rico is going through this tremendous financial crisis. Yesterday I spoke at length to Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Finance Committee. I believe he and his staff director are quite sincere about trying to do something about the financial condition of Puerto Rico, but now, on top of that, this additional plague is added. At the end of the day, we have to do whatever we can to help Puerto Rico in its financial crisis but now especially to help curb the spread of this virus. It is also in Haiti. It just so happens that we have a large Haitian American population in Florida. It is particularly running rampant throughout South America, including Brazil. Guess what is going to happen this summer. The Olympics will be in Brazil, and people from all over the world will be going. It is time to address this problem head-on with the administration's request for $1.9 billion in emergency funding. There are rumors that the Appropriations Committee is looking at a figure of $1.1 billion by stripping out the $250 million that would go through CMS because of the Federal Medicaid assistance increase to support Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program. What have I just said? They are already in crisis, their Medicaid funds have already been cut, and now we are not going to give this assistance to a population where 20 percent is going to be infected? The Appropriations Committee shouldn't cut out that $250 million. There is also the rumor that the Appropriations Committee is going to cut out some $589 million of the request that would go back to replenish the Ebola crisis fund; that in order to meet the emergency, the administration took that money--just under $600 million--over to address the Zika crisis until we can get off our duffs here in Congress and appropriate the emergency appropriations. I hope the Appropriations Committee will think twice before they cut out the money for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and replenishing the Ebola fund. That crisis still goes on, but the success of our being able to get on the Ebola crisis from 2 years ago is why we need to receive that added source to stop it. Otherwise, the consequences will be that the Ebola crisis will come back to the United States. This is truly an emergency. I am calling on our colleagues to approve the President's $1.9 billion emergency funding request now, in the immediate future, not later. The cost of inaction would be great and the consequences devastating. We don't want to have to say in the future: I told you so. I am introducing this legislation. More than likely, it will later be considered possibly as a stand-alone bill but possibly also as an amendment to one of these appropriations bills. I urge our colleagues to support this $1.9 billion emergency assistance request. [[Page S2391]] Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.

A bill to provide emergency supplemental appropriations to address the Zika crisis; to the Committee on Appropriations. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to announce that Senator Reid of Nevada and I will be introducing legislation that is the President's emergency funding request to respond to the Zika virus. I have been on the floor many times talking about the ravages of the Zika virus. It is up to 91 cases in my State of Florida. Fortunately, none of them originated in the State. It is all because of a mosquito bite or some other means of transmission, such as sexual contact, that has been done outside of Florida. That is particularly true in the warmer climates of the Caribbean, Central America, and Latin America. We know the devastating consequences of someone getting this virus-- not as a virus, because it has the effects of a mild flu, but if a mosquito infects a pregnant woman, the researchers understand that if it is any time during the 9 months of the pregnancy, it has the disastrous consequences of severe deformities. What is the result of that? The result is not only trauma to the family involved, enormous tragedy, but look at what the social cost is going to be. The World Health Organization declares this a public health emergency of international concern. The last time the World Health Organization declared such an emergency was for Ebola. Last week our CDC announced that it is ``scarier than they had initially thought'' and that it could be linked to other birth defects, not just the shrunken head and brain that is so horrendous to see pictures of. This isn't just in Florida; 800 Americans in 40 States and territories have been infected. Of course, my State, with 91 cases, has been hit the hardest, and it has spread across 15 counties. The three most recent cases were in the Miami area, and in Florida it includes five pregnant women. Now we are going into the warmer summer months, and this is when the mosquitos breed all the more. This particular mosquito carries the dengue virus, which has its own drastic consequences. This mosquito is all over Puerto Rico. There is an estimate that 20 percent of the population of Puerto Rico may eventually be infected. If that is the case, you can wonder, out of that 20 percent of the population, how many are pregnant women. In a territory of the United States where American citizens reside, you can start to see the extreme depravity and social cost that will result, all at the same time that Puerto Rico is going through this tremendous financial crisis. Yesterday I spoke at length to Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Finance Committee. I believe he and his staff director are quite sincere about trying to do something about the financial condition of Puerto Rico, but now, on top of that, this additional plague is added. At the end of the day, we have to do whatever we can to help Puerto Rico in its financial crisis but now especially to help curb the spread of this virus. It is also in Haiti. It just so happens that we have a large Haitian American population in Florida. It is particularly running rampant throughout South America, including Brazil. Guess what is going to happen this summer. The Olympics will be in Brazil, and people from all over the world will be going. It is time to address this problem head-on with the administration's request for $1.9 billion in emergency funding. There are rumors that the Appropriations Committee is looking at a figure of $1.1 billion by stripping out the $250 million that would go through CMS because of the Federal Medicaid assistance increase to support Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program. What have I just said? They are already in crisis, their Medicaid funds have already been cut, and now we are not going to give this assistance to a population where 20 percent is going to be infected? The Appropriations Committee shouldn't cut out that $250 million. There is also the rumor that the Appropriations Committee is going to cut out some $589 million of the request that would go back to replenish the Ebola crisis fund; that in order to meet the emergency, the administration took that money--just under $600 million--over to address the Zika crisis until we can get off our duffs here in Congress and appropriate the emergency appropriations. I hope the Appropriations Committee will think twice before they cut out the money for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and replenishing the Ebola fund. That crisis still goes on, but the success of our being able to get on the Ebola crisis from 2 years ago is why we need to receive that added source to stop it. Otherwise, the consequences will be that the Ebola crisis will come back to the United States. This is truly an emergency. I am calling on our colleagues to approve the President's $1.9 billion emergency funding request now, in the immediate future, not later. The cost of inaction would be great and the consequences devastating. We don't want to have to say in the future: I told you so. I am introducing this legislation. More than likely, it will later be considered possibly as a stand-alone bill but possibly also as an amendment to one of these appropriations bills. I urge our colleagues to support this $1.9 billion emergency assistance request. [[Page S2391]] Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows.

the result is not only trauma to the family involved, enormous tragedy, but look at what the social cost is going to be. the world health organization declares this a public health emergency of international concern. the last time the world health organization declared such an emergency was for ebola. last week our cdc announced that it is ``scarier than they had initially thought'' and that it could be linked to other birth defects, not just the shrunken head and brain that is so horrendous to see pictures of. this isn't just in florida; 800 americans in 40 states and territories have been infected. of course, my state, with 91 cases, has been hit the hardest, and it has spread across 15 counties. the three most recent cases were in the miami area, and in florida it includes five pregnant women. now we are going into the warmer summer months, and this is when the mosquitos breed all the more. this particular mosquito carries the dengue virus, which has its own drastic consequences. this mosquito is all over puerto rico. there is an estimate that 20 percent of the population of puerto rico may eventually be infected. if that is the case, you can wonder, out of that 20 percent of the population, how many are pregnant women. in a territory of the united states where american citizens reside, you can start to see the extreme depravity and social cost that will result, all at the same time that puerto rico is going through this tremendous financial crisis. yesterday i spoke at length to senator hatch, the chairman of the finance committee. i believe he and his staff director are quite sincere about trying to do something about the financial condition of puerto rico, but now, on top of that, this additional plague is added. at the end of the day, we have to do whatever we can to help puerto rico in its financial crisis but now especially to help curb the spread of this virus. it is also in haiti. it just so happens that we have a large haitian american population in florida. it is particularly running rampant throughout south america, including brazil. guess what is going to happen this summer. the olympics will be in brazil, and people from all over the world will be going. it is time to address this problem head-on with the administration's request for $1.9 billion in emergency funding. there are rumors that the appropriations committee is looking at a figure of $1.1 billion by stripping out the $250 million that would go through cms because of the federal medicaid assistance increase to support puerto rico's medicaid program. what have i just said? they are already in crisis, their medicaid funds have already been cut, and now we are not going to give this assistance to a population where 20 percent is going to be infected? the appropriations committee shouldn't cut out that $250 million. there is also the rumor that the appropriations committee is going to cut out some $589 million of the request that would go back to replenish the ebola crisis fund; that in order to meet the emergency, the administration took that money--just under $600 million--over to address the zika crisis until we can get off our duffs here in congress and appropriate the emergency appropriations. i hope the appropriations committee will think twice before they cut out the money for medicaid in puerto rico and replenishing the ebola fund. that crisis still goes on, but the success of our being able to get on the ebola crisis from 2 years ago is why we need to receive that added source to stop it. otherwise, the consequences will be that the ebola crisis will come back to the united states. this is truly an emergency. i am calling on our colleagues to approve the president's $1.9 billion emergency funding request now, in the immediate future, not later. the cost of inaction would be great and the consequences devastating. we don't want to have to say in the future: i told you so. i am introducing this legislation. more than likely, it will later be considered possibly as a stand-alone bill but possibly also as an amendment to one of these appropriations bills. i urge our colleagues to support this $1.9 billion emergency assistance request. [[page s2391]] mr. nelson. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record. there being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the

Con. Res. 36 Whereas the annihilation of 6,000,000 Jews during the Holocaust and the murder of millions of others by the Nazi German state constitutes 1 of the most tragic and heinous crimes in human history; Whereas hundreds of thousands of Jews survived persecution by the Nazi regime despite being imprisoned, subjected to slave labor, moved into ghettos, forced to live in hiding or under false identity or curfew, or required to wear the ``yellow star''; Whereas in fear of the oncoming Nazi Einsatzgruppen, or ``Nazi Killing Squads'', and the likelihood of extermination, hundreds of thousands of Jewish Nazi victims fled for their lives; Whereas whatever type of persecution suffered by Jews during the Holocaust, the common thread that binds Holocaust victims is that they were targeted for extermination and they lived with a constant fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones; Whereas Holocaust victims immigrated to the United States from Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and the former Soviet Union between 1933 and the date of adoption of this resolution; Whereas it is estimated that there are at least 100,000 Holocaust victims living in the United States and approximately 500,000 Holocaust victims living around the world, including child survivors of the Holocaust;

whereas holocaust victims immigrated to the united states from europe, the middle east, north africa, and the former soviet union between 1933 and the date of adoption of this resolution; whereas it is estimated that there are at least 100,000 holocaust victims living in the united states and approximately 500,000 holocaust victims living around the world, including child survivors of the holocaust; whereas tens of thousands of holocaust victims are at least 80 years old, and the number of surviving holocaust victims is diminishing; whereas at least 50 percent of holocaust victims alive today will pass away within the next decade, and those living victims are becoming frailer and have increasing health and welfare needs; whereas holocaust victims throughout the world continue to suffer from permanent physical and psychological injuries and disabilities and live with the emotional scars of a systematic genocide against the jewish people; whereas many of the emotional and psychological scars of holocaust victims are exacerbated in the old age of the holocaust victims; whereas the past haunts and overwhelms many aspects of the lives of holocaust victims when their health fails them; whereas holocaust victims suffer particular trauma when their emotional and physical circumstances force them to leave the security of their homes and enter institutional or other group living residential facilities; whereas tens of thousands of holocaust victims live in poverty and cannot afford, and do not receive, sufficient medical care, home care, mental health care, medicine, food, transportation, and other vital life-sustaining services that allow individuals to live their final years with comfort and dignity; whereas holocaust victims often lack family support networks and require social worker-supported case management in order to manage their daily lives and access government- funded services; whereas in response to a letter sent by members of congress to the minister of finance of germany in december 2015 relating to increased funding for holocaust victims, german officials acknowledged that ``recent experience has shown that the care financed by the german government to date is insufficient'' and that ``it is imperative to expand these assistance measures quickly given the advanced age of many of the affected persons''; whereas german chancellor konrad adenauer acknowledged, in 1951, the responsibility of germany to provide moral and financial compensation to holocaust victims worldwide; whereas every successive german chancellor has reaffirmed that acknowledgment, including chancellor angela merkel, who, in 2007, reaffirmed that ``only by fully accepting its enduring responsibility for this most appalling period and for the cruelest crimes in its history, can germany shape the future''; and whereas congress believes it is the moral and historical responsibility of germany to comprehensively, permanently, and urgently provide resources for the medical, mental health, and long-term care needs of all holocaust victims: now therefore, be it resolved by the senate (the house of representatives concurring), that congress-- (1) acknowledges the financial and moral commitment of the federal republic of germany during the 7 decades prior to the date of adoption of this resolution to provide a measure of justice for holocaust victims; (2) supports the goal of ensuring that all holocaust victims in the united states and around the world are able to live with dignity, comfort, and security in their remaining years; (3) applauds the nonprofit organizations and agencies that work tirelessly to honor and assist holocaust victims in the communities of the nonprofit organizations and agencies; (4) acknowledges the ongoing process of negotiations between the federal republic of germany and the conference on jewish material claims against germany (referred to in this resolution as the ``claims conference'') in order to secure funding for holocaust victims and for vital social services provided through nonprofit organizations and agencies around the world; (5) acknowledges that the federal republic of germany and the claims conference have established a new high level working group that will develop proposals for extensive assistance for homecare and other social welfare needs of holocaust victims; (6) urges the working group described in paragraph (5) to recognize the imperative to immediately and fully fund medical, mental health, and long-term care needs of surviving holocaust victims, with full transparency and accountability, to ensure all funds for holocaust victims from the federal republic of germany are administered efficiently, fairly, and without delay; and (7) urges the federal republic of germany to reaffirm its commitment to fulfill its moral responsibility to holocaust victims by-- [[page s2396]] (a) ensuring that each holocaust victim receives all of the prescribed medical care, home care, mental health care, and other vital services necessary to live in dignity; and (b) providing, without delay, additional financial resources to address the unique needs of holocaust victims. ____________________",6858

Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize the 110th anniversary of Pine Castle United Methodist Church in Orlando, Florida, and commend their strong heritage of service within Orange County, Florida. On July 30, 1900, a group of women in the community organized a church community that housed the Methodist, Baptist, and Missionary Alliance congregations under one roof. In December 1906, nineteen congregation members laid the foundation for what would become Pine Castle United Methodist Church. Pine Castle United Methodist Church has served as a beacon of hope in our local community. Many lives have been impacted through the church's ministry, and I am honored to recognize their long history of dedication and service. This is a momentous year for Pine Castle United Methodist Church, and they deserve to be commended for their 110 years of service to our community. It is my pleasure to join Pastor Scott George and the congregation at Pine Castle United Methodist Church in celebrating this historical milestone. I would like to thank them for their many years of faithful ministry to our community and their dedication to Christian leadership.

FILEMON VELA of texas in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Porter Early College High School on their victory in the Texas 5A Boys Soccer State Championship game which was played last Saturday in Georgetown. The win marks the second time the Porter Cowboys have won the state-wide soccer championship, earning the first title in 2006. After a long season marked by hard work and dedication by students, parents, coaches, teachers, support staff and administrators, the team clinched the state championship defeating Frisco Wakeland 10-9 in penalty kicks to secure the 3-2 victory. It is my great pleasure to honor the team members: Alexis Anzures Alexis Armendariz Daniel Briseno Robert Briseno Caleb Castillo Anthony Cuellar Marco Don Juan Omar Estrada Harambe Garcia Oscar Garcia Jaime Gomez Luis Lara Esteban Mata Jose Nava Jose Pardillo Jerry Perez Agustin Pizano Josue Reyna Luis Reyna Mario Rios Diego Rivera Uriel Sepulveda Angel Silva Enrique Soto--Captain Fernando Trigo Ricky Vidal Managers: Franco Gonzalez and Haziel Trevino Coaches: Jose Espitia, Eddie Buentello, Adrian Navarro and Antonio Serrano Video: Maria Esteves Porter Early College High School, located in the heart of Southmost neighborhood, is an important community institution. Countless teachers, police officers, entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors and engineers are Porter alumni, and the school bears the name of a woman who made important contributions to the City of Brownsville. Gladys Porter, daughter of philanthropist Earl C. Sams, who was the first president of the J.C. Penney retail chain, was devoted to South Texas. Ms. Porter was a well-known civic leader in Brownsville and was the driving force behind the Gladys Porter Zoo, which today attracts thousands of visitors annually to the Rio Grande Valley. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the families of these young men. Parents, grandparents, siblings and other family members make great sacrifices to support student athletes during the competitive season and all year long. Porter parents have spent years driving to practices, washing uniforms, cleaning cleats, cheering from the sidelines, and generally making sure these student athletes have everything they need to succeed both on and off the field. The coaches, teachers, and administrators deserve recognition for all they do to provide students with a high quality education that balances academic and athletic achievement. Teachers and coaches serve as role models, providing critical motivation and support for these young athletes. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in congratulating the Porter Cowboys boy's soccer team for their victory in the Texas 5A State Championship. Each of them, their parents, teachers, coaches and support staff make the Rio Grande Valley proud, and I wish them success in all their future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E561] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING PORTER EARLY COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL BOYS SOCCER TEAM ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Father Lawrence W. ``Bill'' Carmody, beloved priest of the Colorado Springs Diocese and tireless warrior for the unborn. He passed away on February 23, at the age of 58 after a long battle with cancer. A Colorado native ordained in 1990, Father Carmody faithfully served the Colorado Springs area for more than 25 years. In 1995 he was named the pastor of Corpus Christi Parish. Later, Father Carmody led the movement to found St. Dominic Catholic Church in Security, where he also served as pastor. St. Dominic's is the largest Catholic church in the Colorado Springs area. Father Carmody was also a devoted leader of the pro-life movement. He led the Diocese's Respect Life Office, dedicated to the promotion of a greater understanding of the Church's teachings to respect life in all its phases. For over a decade, Father Carmody lovingly celebrated mass every week outside a local abortion clinic. In 1994, he introduced the Project Rachel program in Colorado Springs. The Project Rachel program is dedicated to helping those suffering after an abortion. Father Carmody called his work with the Project Rachel program as the ``most profound experience I have as a priest--watching people heal from what they believe is an unforgiveable sin and find God's forgiveness.'' Father Carmody was truly a great man who spent his time on earth defending life and lovingly ministering to those our Heavenly Father entrusted to his care. He touched the lives of many while living out his calling to serve the Colorado Springs community. I pray that his legacy continue to be an inspiration to all of us in the years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E561] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING FATHER LAWRENCE W. ``BILL'' CARMODY ______ HON.

Father Carmody called his work with the Project Rachel program as the ``most profound experience I have as a priest--watching people heal from what they believe is an unforgiveable sin and find God's forgiveness.''

JOSEPH CROWLEY of new york in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to acknowledge Hopey's Day in New York City, which is on April 22, 2016. Hopey's Day was initiated by the Hopey's Heart Foundation, which works to raise awareness of sudden cardiac arrest, particularly among student athletes, and helps to place automated external defibrillators (AEDs) at schools and at community and recreational centers. The driving force behind Hopey's Day has been WNBA New York Liberty center Tina Charles, who founded the Hopey's Heart Foundation in honor of her late aunt, Maureen ``Hopey'' Vaz. As an athlete, Tina recognized that too many promising young athletes lose their lives to sudden cardiac arrest on basketball courts and sports fields before they can attain the same dreams she achieved. Under Tina's leadership, the Hopey's Heart Foundation has provided over 200 AEDs to schools around the U.S. and in other parts of the world. To mark Hopey's Day, the Hopey's Heart Foundation, along with Safe Kids Worldwide, will be holding sports safety clinics at New York City schools, including P.S. 127 in Queens and in P.S. 55 in the Bronx. These clinics will help kids, parents, and coaches understand how they can prevent risks encountered in sports, like sudden cardiac arrest, as well as teach about proper hydration and concussions. Notably, attendees will learn emergency response and how to use an AED. These clinics also mark the beginning of the Hopey's Heart Foundation Build UP NYC program to expand its work across New York City, and I look forward to seeing more schools have the opportunity to present these experiences to their students. I am so proud of the work that Hopey's Heart Foundation, Safe Kids NYC and Safe Kids Queens have done, as well as of the tremendous leadership shown by Tina Charles, a native of East Elmhurst, Queens, where one of the Hopey's Day clinics will take place. Tina has committed herself to giving back to her home community and elsewhere in so many ways. I thank the Hopey's Heart Foundation and Tina Charles for their commitment to protect the hearts of so many children playing sports. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E562] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING HOPEY'S DAY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the Veterans of Foreign Wars Davis-Seamon Post 812 as an exceptional veteran service organization in my district of El Paso, Texas. Post 812 is named in honor of First Lieutenant Hart Davis and First Lieutenant Alexander Rives Seamon, both of whom were killed while serving our country during World War I. The Davis-Seamon Post was founded in 1921 and is the largest Veterans Service Organization in El Paso, with 835 members dedicated to serving veterans, active duty service members, reservists, their families as well as others in the El Paso community. As part of its commitment to serving El Paso veterans after they have transitioned out of the military, the Davis-Seamon Post enlists the help of a service officer that advises veterans on their eligibility for VA benefits. This relationship ensures that our community's veterans receive updates on changes within the VA as well as timely access to the benefits they have earned and deserve. Members of the Post have also organized numerous welcome back and farewell dinners for soldiers and their families, feeding more than 140,000 people since 2001. The Davis-Seamon Post has also taken great pride in preparing and serving Thanksgiving Day meals for service members and their families returning home from Afghanistan. In the spirit of helping others and creating a community of inclusivity within El Paso, the Davis-Seamon Post regularly donates its space to other local veteran service organizations and has partnered with different community groups to address the issue of veteran homelessness in El Paso. The Davis-Seamon Post also furthers its ties to the community by encouraging its membership to invite guests to its events so they may become familiar with its mission and service to veterans and members of the military. I am proud to know that a veterans service organization like the VFW Davis-Seamon Post 812 exists in El Paso. Their support and care for our veterans is longstanding and their efforts will help in continuing to make El Paso and our region a better place to live. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E563] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS DAVIS-SEAMON POST 812 OF EL PASO, TEXAS ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the Veterans of Foreign Wars Davis-Seamon Post 812 as an exceptional veteran service organization in my district of El Paso, Texas. Post 812 is named in honor of First Lieutenant Hart Davis and First Lieutenant Alexander Rives Seamon, both of whom were killed while serving our country during World War I. The Davis-Seamon Post was founded in 1921 and is the largest Veterans Service Organization in El Paso, with 835 members dedicated to serving veterans, active duty service members, reservists, their families as well as others in the El Paso community. As part of its commitment to serving El Paso veterans after they have transitioned out of the military, the Davis-Seamon Post enlists the help of a service officer that advises veterans on their eligibility for VA benefits. This relationship ensures that our community's veterans receive updates on changes within the VA as well as timely access to the benefits they have earned and deserve. Members of the Post have also organized numerous welcome back and farewell dinners for soldiers and their families, feeding more than 140,000 people since 2001.

MIKE THOMPSON of california in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Beringer Vineyards, which today celebrates its first annual Founders Day ceremony, commemorating the vineyard's founding in 1876 and 140 years of continuous operation. The success of Beringer is of particular importance to me, as I worked as a maintenance supervisor at Beringer after returning from serving in Vietnam. Since the winery began operations in 1876 under founders Frederick and Jacob Beringer, it has not missed a harvest or wine vintage, making Beringer California's longest continually operating winery. In another contribution to the history of St. Helena, the founding brothers planted the now-famous tunnel of elm trees along Main Street shortly after Beringer Vineyard's founding. Beringer Vineyards became the first California winery to offer visitors tours in 1934 after the repeal of Prohibition, contributing to the influx of visitors to Napa Valley. The winery was named a State Historical Landmark in 1967, and the Rhine House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. During its long history, Beringer has earned numerous accolades among wine professionals. It is the only winery to win the `Wine of the Year' from Wine Spectator for both a red and a white wine, the 1986 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon and the 1994 Private Reserve Chardonnay. Indeed, Beringer has had more placements on the Wine Spectator's Top 100 list than any other winery in the world. In a further testament to the winery's longevity and quality, from 1988 to March 2016, Beringer earned 450 90 plus scores in premiere wine scoring publications. Mr. Speaker, Beringer Vineyards has been a resolute leader of the California wine industry for 140 years. It is truly a Napa Valley institution, and its success has brought acclaim to Napa Valley growers and winemakers. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor Beringer Vineyards here today. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E564] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING BERINGER VINEYARDS ______ HON.

KAREN BASS of california in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, brave Americans from every walk of life have demonstrated their courage and commitment to freedom by serving in the Armed Forces of the United States of America. Many of those military personnel are parents whose children make significant sacrifices, too. The average child in a military family will move six to nine times during a school career, three times more frequently than non-military families. During deployments, military children face separation and loss, and they face the joys and the challenges of reunification when deployments end. If a parent suffers an injury, the military child must also adapt to the new reality of that parent's limitations. Some military- connected children end up in the foster care system, bringing with them particular needs and circumstances. And if a parent is killed, the child's life is changed forever. In recognition of this, April has been designated as the Month of the Military Child. According to the Department of Defense, 1.88 million children have parents in the active duty or reserve branches of the military, and many more children have parents who are veterans. Los Angeles is home to the highest population of military veterans in California. On Sunday, April 17, Los Angeles Veterans Collaborative--Families & Children Working Group will hold their 3rd annual celebration of this occasion at the Los Angeles Public Library. Organized under the auspices of the USC Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families in my district, their work offers an opportunity for us to applaud these children's strength and resilience, and to honor their unique contributions and sacrifices. I salute military children and all of the parents, family members, friends, professionals and organizations who support them. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E564] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MONTH OF THE MILITARY CHILD ______ HON.

RUBEN HINOJOSA of texas in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a topic very near and dear to my heart: My home of Deep South Texas. [[Page E565]] I was born and raised in the Rio Grande Valley, a region situated along the U.S.-Mexico border in the southernmost tip of Texas, which encompasses Willacy, Cameron, Hidalgo and Starr Counties. Rich in history and culture and built on enduring family bonds. The Rio Grande Valley is home to more than 1.3 million residents. For nearly twenty years, I have had the honor and privilege of representing the fifteenth congressional district of Texas, a dynamic and unique district that stretches from Guadalupe County, southeast from San Antonio all the way down to Deep South Texas along the border with Mexico. I feel extremely fortunate to call a border community my home. As the proud son of Ed-Couch, Texas, I am surprised by news reports that depict the border as violent and ``in crisis.'' Unlike the fear mongers who wish to scapegoat all our problems on immigrants, when I talk about the border, I know what I am talking about. First, our border communities are some of the safest in our nation, providing great quality of life with the low crime rates. In fact, state and federal crime data show that border cities are safer than many larger U.S. cities, with violent crime rates remaining the same or dropping in the last five years. Moreover, the idea that undocumented immigrants are more likely to commit crimes is simply false. A Texas Tribune analysis of incarceration and immigration records found there is little evidence that undocumented immigrants commit crime at higher rates than the general population and they appear to be underrepresented in Texas prisons. As a matter of fact, the U.S.-Mexico border has never been more secure in the history of the United States. In the past ten years, border security funding has tripled and we have doubled the size of the Border Patrol from about 10,000 agents to approximately 20,000 today. Second, our border is not being overrun. We are seeing record low apprehensions at our southern border. Today, a majority of those apprehensions are immigrants from Central America who fear violence in their home countries and their only hope is to seek refuge in the United States. Our great nation is made up of immigrants, many of whom landed on our shores tired, poor and in huddled-masses, yearning to be free. We should not close our borders and turn back on them now. That is not who we are. This brings to mind a quote from the first Mexican-American federal district Judge Reynaldo Garza who was appointed by President Kennedy in 1961 and sat on the bench in Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. When swearing in new citizens, Judge Garza used to say: ``I do not worry that people want to come to the United States, I would worry if people did not want to come because then it would mean we would no longer be the country of freedom and opportunity that we are.'' As a son of immigrants and as former chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I am proud to represent my district along the U.S.- Mexico border with a large population of immigrants, who contribute to the vibrancy of our national economy, job growth and rich culture. Indeed, the stories of our immigrant neighbors, friends, and colleagues are very real, enriching the overall narrative of what it means to be an American. They are Americans and part of our national fabric. I invite all my fellow Americans to come down to the U.S.-Mexico border region to experience firsthand the rich culture and wonderful people who make up our border communities and my home of Deep South Texas. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E564-E565] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF THE U.S.-MEXICO AND U.S.-CANADA BORDER ______ HON.

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgE565-3,CREC-2016-04-21,114,IN HONOR OF GEORGE TANIMURA,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E565-E566] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF GEORGE TANIMURA ______ HON. SAM FARR of california in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay my respects to a great American, George Tanimura, who passed away on April 15, three months short of his 101st birthday. I offer my deepest condolences to George's wife of 72 years, Masaye, and to George's close-knit family: his son Glenn and his daughter Leslie, and their spouses; his grandchildren Chris, Erin, Ryan and Kelly and their spouses, and to his great grandchildren Makenzie, Jaklyn, and Karter, and to his siblings. George lived a remarkable life that spanned the Great Depression, WWII, and the rise of the modern information economy. In that time, George confronted prejudice, helped to rebuild a dislocated Japanese- American community in the Salinas Valley, nurtured a large extended family, and fostered the development of the modern fresh produce industry. George was a farmer's farmer. As one of the founders of the Tanimura & Antle, he helped build one of the nation's largest private lettuce producers. So while you may have never heard of George Tanimura, I can guarantee that every Member of this House has eaten something that George and his family have grown. He has planted and nurtured a legacy that will produce a crop for generations to come. George was born in San Juan Bautista on July 2, 1915. His parents had emigrated from Japan to build a better life in the United States. While attending grammar school in Castroville, George thinned iceberg lettuce on his father's small farm. After his mother died, George, the eldest of 12 siblings, had to leave high school to farm with his father. Then when George was just 16, his father died leaving George with the responsibility for the family and their farm. In the midst of the depression, George became the patriarch of his large family. Under his leadership, the Tanimura children began their own prosperous farming operations. However, just as they were recovering, the U.S. entry into WWII turned the Tanimuras' lives upside down. In 1942, they found themselves imprisoned by our government along with other Americans of Japanese descent in remote internment camps across the desert West. And even though the Tanimuras lost everything, two of his brothers fought with the U.S. Army in Europe. For George, his time in the camp offered him another opportunity to find fortune in the midst of adversity. He met Masaye Yamauchi and they were married on September 21, 1944. When George, Masaye, and their family returned to the Salinas Valley, they resumed lettuce farming. In the late 1950s, the Tanimuras began to grow exclusively for Bud Antle, another legendary Salinas Valley grower. Bud, and his son Bob, had been working closely with the Tanimura family for many years. Finally, in 1982, George and Bob combined over [[Page E566]] 30 years of mutual friendship, respect, and experience to create Tanimura & Antle. The new company combined the Antle's shipping and marketing savvy with the Tanimura's growing expertise. That combination has helped T&A grow into one of the world's premier fresh produce companies. And it forms the basis of T&A's continued success. Throughout his life, George was extremely active in countless community efforts, giving his leadership, commitment and wealth to making the Salinas Valley a better place for all farm families to live. Even though he was a living legend in the farming community and widely respected by all who knew him, it was his deep sense of humility that kept him from claiming any recognition other than his simple refrain, ``it doesn't matter, I'm just a farmer.'' While George Tanimura thought of himself as a humble farmer, his hard work and integrity created one of the pillars of the American agricultural economy. The Budda said, ``in the end only three things matter: how much you loved, how gently you lived, and how gratefully you let go of things not meant for you.'' In the end, George Tanimura will be remembered for his love for his family, how he lived his life and his willingness to encourage and support others in the fresh produce industry. It is a legacy for all of us to remember in these turbulent times. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E565-E566] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF GEORGE TANIMURA ______ HON.

Since their inception, the National Collegiate Honors Council has been dedicated to excellence in education in diverse subject and curriculum areas. They serve over 800 colleges and universities and over 325,000 students across the country. I also want to recognize the Kingsborough Community College, in Southern Brooklyn, for their outstanding dedication to academic enrichment and achievement. Kingsborough Community College serves about 14,000 full and part-time students each year in a wide array of liberal arts and career education courses. Kingsborough Community College provides its students with a high level of education through its associate degree programs that prepare students to transfer to senior colleges or enter directly into a professional career. Kingsborough Community College offers qualifying students the opportunity to challenge themselves in the Honors Program with rigorous coursework, the ability to study with other gifted students and benefit from increased contact with top faculty.

TOM McCLINTOCK of california in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the state and federal park rangers who have served Yosemite National Park over the last 150 years. Specifically, I rise to honor Mr. Galen Clark, the first appointed ``guardian'' (park ranger) of Yosemite in 1866. As the first ranger, Mr. Clark served 22 years while dedicating his life to protect and administer the nation's first great outdoors natural park at Yosemite. Since then, the park has served over 185 million visitors. Set aside by President Abraham Lincoln in 1864 with the express intent ``to be held for public use, resort, and recreation for all time,'' the Yosemite Valley is a national treasure that belongs to the American people in perpetuity. President Lincoln made this land available to the public by understanding and respecting the government's role ``of the people, by the people, and for the people,'' describing the philosophy behind the dedication of Yosemite. Today, the National Park Service administers more than 400 national parks throughout the United States by partnering with communities to preserve historical landmarks and create outdoor recreational places. The California Department of Parks and Recreation manages 280 parks, preserving some of the finest resources found in California. Ranger Clark served honorably as Yosemite's first park ranger, creating a prestigious fraternal order for those who have followed in his footsteps, embodying Thomas Jefferson's words: ``When a man assumes a public trust, he should consider himself as public property.'' Recognition of Mr. Clark's appointment as the first park ranger is a momentous event, offering an opportunity to reflect, highlight, and honor the history and contribution of park staff over the last 150 years. Mr. Speaker, Ranger Clark and all other park rangers who have committed their lives to the preservation of Yosemite National Park as a place of ``public use, resort, and recreation for all time'' deserve to be remembered for their service and dedication for ensuring public access and enjoyment of this extraordinary national treasure. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E566] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF PARK RANGERS AT YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK ______ HON.

MATT CARTWRIGHT of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the City of Scranton, which will celebrate its 150th anniversary on April 23, 2016. Scranton has a long history of significant contributions to the economic, civic, and social development of our nation. The city was the center of America's anthracite coal industry, a major transport hub during the golden era of railroads, and home to the first electric streetcar. In 1778, Isaac Tripp settled the village of Slocum Hollow in the Lackawanna Valley. With the founding of the Lackawanna Steel Company by Seldon and George Scranton in the 1840s, the small agrarian community rapidly transformed into a multicultural, industrial center responsible for producing T-rails, which were used to construct railroads all across the country. In February 1856, Scranton was officially established as a borough. On April 23, 1866, Scranton was incorporated as a city of 35,000 people and was merged with the neighboring communities of Hyde Park and Providence. When Lackawanna County was formed in 1878, Scranton was named as the county seat. Today, Scranton is one of the largest metropolitan areas in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with more than 75,000 citizens residing in the ``Electric City.'' Many of the city's attractions, such as the Steamtown National Historic Site, Everhart Museum, and the Lackawanna Coal Mine Tour, commemorate Scranton's history as an industrial and cultural center. Scranton is home to a thriving, welcoming, diverse community committed to celebrating the ethnic heritage on which the city was built. It hosts one of the nation's largest St. Patrick's Day parades and La Festa Italiana. A hub for higher education, Scranton is also home to five colleges and universities: Marywood University, The University of Scranton, The Commonwealth Medical College, Lackawanna College, and Johnson College. It is an honor to recognize Scranton on its sesquicentennial celebration. I am proud to represent a city so rich in history with so bright a future. May the citizens of Scranton honor their past with pride and look forward with confidence to great things as they celebrate the city's 150th anniversary. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E567] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 50th anniversary of Beach City, in Chambers County, Texas. Located between Trinity Bay and San Jacinto River, Beach City sits about eight miles southeast of Baytown, in western Chambers County. Through the 1800s this area was host to a number of bayside settlements and camps, and many scenes from the struggle for Texas independence. In March 1836, following the fall of the Alamo and massacre at Goliad, Gen. Sam Houston ordered a retreat known as The Runaway Scrape. On the way to join up with the fleeing Texian Army, the famed Twin Sisters cannons passed through present-day Beach City, just in time to provide Gen. Houston with the firepower necessary to defeat the Mexican Army, and secure Texas' independence at the Battle of San Jacinto. By the 1960s, facing possible annexation by nearby Baytown, Beach City residents overwhelmingly voted to incorporate. On April 11, 1966, Beach City's nearly 500 permanent residents officially incorporated. Newly established, Beach City had its first election on May 21, 1966, where the people chose Eloice Jordan to serve as their first mayor. Billy Combs currently serves as the 11th mayor of Beach City, a position he has held since 2010. It is my distinct honor to recognize and celebrate the 50th anniversary of Beach City.

Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4482, the Southwest Border Security Threat Assessment Act of 2016. If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Mark Grabowicz. Sincerely, Keith Hall. Enclosure. H.R. 4482--Southwest Border Security Threat Assessment Act of 2016 H.R. 4482 would require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct an analysis of potential threats and security gaps along the southwest border of the United States. The bill also would require DHS, not later than June 30, 2017, to issue a strategic plan to protect U.S. borders. Based on information from DHS, CBO estimates that conducting analysis and preparing the strategic plan as required by H.R. 4482 would cost about $1 million in 2017; such spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Because enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4482 would not increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2027. H.R. 4482 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Mark Grabowicz. The estimate was approved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E567-E568] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] H.R. 4482, THE ``SOUTHWEST BORDER SECURITY THREAT ASSESSMENT ACT OF 2016'' ______ HON.

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia Courts and Public Defender Service Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments Act. The bill would make a minor change to the authorities of the District of Columbia Courts (D.C. Courts) and the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia (PDS), placing these entities in the same position as their federal counterparts for more effective management and operation. The bill would give the D.C. Courts and PDS the same authority federal agencies and federal courts already have to offer voluntary separation incentive payments, or buyouts, to their employees. The fiscal year 2016 omnibus bill already gives D.C. Courts buyout authority--but my bill would make this authorization permanent, and would extend it to PDS in addition to the courts. Buyouts would allow the D.C. Courts and PDS to respond to their future administrative and budget needs, and would provide the flexibility to extend buyout offers to their employees. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has determined that voluntary separation incentive payments may be made only where statutorily authorized. While federal agencies and federal courts have the statutory authority to offer buyouts, PDS and the D.C. Courts have not been expressly permitted to permanently provide them to their employees. PDS and the D.C. Courts seek the same buyout authority in order to manage their workforce as budget conditions and needs change. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E568] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURTS AND PUBLIC DEFENDER SERVICE VOLUNTARY SEPARATION INCENTIVE PAYMENTS ACT ______ HON.

DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Mr. Bob Myers, CEO of Pillar Technology Group for its innovative vision while creating Des Moines, Iowa's newest technology office space, aptly called ``The Forge''. The Ohio-based technology firm works with large companies to develop unique software for autonomous vehicles and ``The Internet of Things.'' Pillar Technology Group prides itself for being in direct competition to many of California's Silicon Valley firms, stating that Des Moines, Iowa lends itself to a venue which ``constantly pushes us.'' Pillar Technology Group has other ``Forge'' locations in Michigan and Ohio. Des Moines was selected, said CEO Myers, because it is close to several universities, has a good talent pool and is increasingly innovative. Calling Des Moines, Iowa ``the Silicon Prairie,'' Myers revealed they have hired at least 30 employees in Iowa to join their current staff of 200 nationwide. Bouyed by a loan from the Iowa Economic Development Authority Board in 2015, Pillar Technology Group established its foothold in central Iowa. Myers explained that ``The Forge'' is a philosophy, not a place. Upon entering their doors, said Myers, there is an aura of ``no constraints.'' Nothing is impossible. That's the Iowa way. With hard work, determination, innovation and an open mind, anything can be accomplished. Mr. Speaker, I applaud and congratulate Pillar Technology Group and CEO Bob Myers for locating its innovative vision in Iowa. I am proud to represent the Pillar Technology Group and its employees in the United States Congress. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating the firm and wishing Pillar Technology Group's ``The Forge'' nothing but continued success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E568] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO BOB MYERS AND PILLAR TECHNOLOGY GROUP ______ HON.

MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of new mexico in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the 65th anniversary of Bueno Foods, a local company that has become synonymous with our traditional and cherished New Mexican dishes. In 1946, several brothers from the Baca family returned from serving in World War II and they scraped together enough money to buy a small neighborhood grocery store called the Ace Food Store. The small business was successful, until the larger chain grocery stores moved into the area. The Baca brothers wanted to compete and knew they must find innovative ways to keep the business profitable. They added a carry-out component using their mother's delicious home cooked New Mexican food and began manufacturing corn and flour tortillas on a pie crust roller and making tamales and posole for sale. Then they had an idea. Everyone was getting a freezer and Birds Eye frozen vegetables were very popular. They decided to roast green chile over an open flame in the early fall and freeze it so that people could have chile year-round. There was no equipment to flame-roast green chile on a commercial scale, and the brothers had to design and build equipment, and implement the process for large scale production. Bueno Foods was founded in 1951. For over 65 years, Bueno Foods has grown from a small neighborhood grocery store into one of the Southwest's premier producers of New Mexican and Mexican foods, serving restaurants and retail customers throughout the United States. It is still owned and operated by the Baca family, with Jacqueline ``Jackie'' Baca serving as President since 1986. Bueno Foods symbolizes the spirit and determination of true entrepreneurs who turned their idea into a thriving business that preserves and promotes our heritage. I would like to congratulate the Baca family and their employees for 65 years of supplying quality products, providing excellent customer service and creating opportunities to give back to the community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E569] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING BUENO FOODS ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege and honor to welcome the Vice President of the Republic of Zambia, the Honorable Inonge Mutukwa Wina, to my Los Angeles district for a visit. Vice President Wina is the highest ranking woman in Zambian government history, and she brings a delegation of officials to the U.S. with the assistance of Robert Sichinga, Jr., Honorary Consul for Zambia in Los Angeles. A major purpose of Vice President Wina's visit is to raise awareness of the tremendous opportunities for economic investment in her home country. Some of the fastest-growing economies in the world are in Africa. In particular, Mrs. Wina comes to promote the Jubilee Women's Integrated Highway Markets Program as a support for entrepreneurship that will begin to build wealth among rural families. The Jubilee Women's Integrated Highway Markets Program is a three year program to transform makeshift markets along Zambian highways into thriving economic engines, run cooperatively by the women who make up the majority of businesses found in these locations. It aims to create modern, integrated economic hubs, one in each of Zambia's ten provinces. The markets would offer not only sturdy structures, plumbing and solar power, but would also offer literacy and skills training, banking and other services, and child care facilities. Women play an essential role in lifting families out of poverty and promoting a nation's fortunes. Studies show that investing in women's businesses correlates closely with better-fed children who stay longer in school, and women tend to reinvest profits in expanding their business, thereby building wealth for the longer term. I wish Vice President Wina and all of those traveling with her a pleasant, rewarding and successful trip, and I look forward to partnering with her in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E569] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE VISIT OF ZAMBIAN VICE PRESIDENT INONGE WINA ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Ruby and Bruce Bentley of Macedonia, Iowa, on the very special occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary. They celebrated their anniversary on March 19, 2016. The Bentleys are known for their commitment to their family and community. Their marriage blessed them with five children and many grandchildren. The community of Macedonia knows the Bentleys as a close-knit family, living their faith and committed to one another. The entire generation of this union lives within seven miles of each other, calling the Bruce and Ruby homestead, ``Bentley East.'' This marriage is a union of dedication to a strong work ethic with their cattle- feeding business, recognized as Producers of the Year in 2006 and Cattleman's Association Brand Wall operation in 2011. But even working with their 2,000 head of cattle for the past 50 years, the Bentleys are dedicated to volunteerism. Bruce is involved in his grandchildren's school activities, having served on the Carson- Macedonia School Board and active in the Riverside Pride and Booster clubs. Ruby has served on the Pottawattamie County Tourism Committee, Macedonia Development Committee, other civic activities and boards, and was even named Iowan for A Day at the Iowa State Fair. Mr. Speaker, Bruce and Ruby's lifelong commitment to each other and their family truly embodies Iowa values. I commend this great couple on their 50th year together and I wish them many more.

They celebrated their anniversary on March 19, 2016. The Bentleys are known for their commitment to their family and community. Their marriage blessed them with five children and many grandchildren. The community of Macedonia knows the Bentleys as a close-knit family, living their faith and committed to one another. The entire generation of this union lives within seven miles of each other, calling the Bruce and Ruby homestead, ``Bentley East.'' This marriage is a union of dedication to a strong work ethic with their cattle- feeding business, recognized as Producers of the Year in 2006 and Cattleman's Association Brand Wall operation in 2011. But even working with their 2,000 head of cattle for the past 50 years, the Bentleys are dedicated to volunteerism. Bruce is involved in his grandchildren's school activities, having served on the Carson- Macedonia School Board and active in the Riverside Pride and Booster clubs. Ruby has served on the Pottawattamie County Tourism Committee, Macedonia Development Committee, other civic activities and boards, and was even named Iowan for A Day at the Iowa State Fair. Mr. Speaker, Bruce and Ruby's lifelong commitment to each other and their family truly embodies Iowa values. I commend this great couple on their 50th year together and I wish them many more. I know my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives [[Page E570]] will join me in congratulating them on this momentous occasion. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E569-E570] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO RUBY AND BRUCE BENTLEY ______ HON.

TOM EMMER of minnesota in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise Amber Eckstein, who has been selected as the 2015-2016 ACT College and Career Readiness Campaign state exemplar in Minnesota. In order to receive this prestigious honor, an individual must prove their strong effort towards college and career readiness, and Amber certainly embodies these requirements. Education is the key that opens all of life's doors. In the United States today, a college degree has become more necessary than ever before, with the majority of jobs requiring some sort of post-secondary education.

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgE570-5,CREC-2016-04-21,114,HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MARY ANN WASIL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E570-E571] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MARY ANN WASIL ______ HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO of connecticut in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is with the heaviest of hearts that I rise today to take a moment to pay tribute to an incredible woman who I consider one of my personal heroes, Mary Ann Wasil who lost a brilliant battle with breast cancer late last week. Mary Ann possessed a tenacious spirit, an unyielding faith, a heart full of love, and an infectious smile--she was one-of-a-kind and will be deeply missed by all of those fortunate enough to have known and worked with her. For one whose life was cut so short, Mary Ann had an extraordinary story. She was a police officer, an actor, a development officer for her church and its elementary school, the founder of a non-profit organization, a health activist, and, most importantly and above all others, a mother of three. She gave 110 percent to everything that she did, every project she undertook, and every battle she fought. Breast cancer was what took Mary Ann from us, but it is also what one of her lasting legacies was born from. Battling to remission after her first diagnosis with Stage II breast cancer in 2004, Mary Ann took her experience and turned it into, not only a teachable moment, but a successful and much needed breast health initiative, the Get in Touch Foundation. Mary Ann discovered the initial lump in her breast while doing a self-breast examination and her cancer was only diagnosed correctly and quickly because she was so familiar with her body and her breasts. Even with some doctors telling her not to worry, to wait, Mary Ann pushed on because she knew it was more than a simple fluctuation. As Mary Ann waged her war with breast cancer, she looked into the eyes of her two young daughters and knew she wanted to do something to make sure that they, as well as young girls everywhere, were armed with all of the information and tools they would need to be strong and smart in breast health. Thus, the Get in Touch Foundation was born. The Get In Touch Girls Program and Daisy Wheel teaches girls to ``get in touch'' with their bodies through self-examination. Developed by board members and members of the medical community, including focus-groups of girls ages 8 through 18, the interactive Daisy Wheel teaches the importance of and how to do a breast self-examination. The Daisy Wheel is given to girls in grades 9 through 12 when health educators discuss hygiene and the girls' changing bodies. The program has been implemented in more than twenty-six countries across the globe and the Daisy Wheel has been downloaded in more than eighty countries. The impact of this program is as extraordinary as its founder. In 2010 Mary Ann won a contract from Balboa Press to publish her memoir, A Diary of Healing: My Intense and Meaningful Life with Cancer. Throughout its pages you can hear Mary Ann's laughter, feel her outrage, and you will often find yourself crying with her, experiencing the twists and turns of her journey. Mary Ann battled back to remission several times over the last decade, always grateful for the additional time she had with family and [[Page E571]] friends. And though she lost this last battle, her story will continue to be an inspiration. My heart goes out to her children, Betsy, Mary, and Eddy. Just thirteen, twelve, and ten at the time of their mother's diagnosis, they were forced to grow-up remarkably quickly but always in the warmth of Mary Ann's smile and secure in the knowledge of her love for them. I know that, in each their own way, they will carry-on Mary Ann's legacy of love, courage, education, and hope. Over the years, I developed a deep friendship with Mary Ann and I consider myself so fortunate to have known her. She was, quite simply, an extraordinary human being. Activist, author, mentor, friend, and mother--Mary Ann Wasil was a woman whose time with us, though short, left an indelible mark on all our lives. Though we will all miss her tenacity, dedication, and, of course, her smile, family and friends will gather in their brightest, most vividly colored clothes, wearing their fanciest shows and celebrate the life of Mary Ann Wasil and the many gifts she brought to all of our lives. As Mary Ann would say--Hope Lives. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E570-E571] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MARY ANN WASIL ______ HON.

Mrs. Petty was born on a small farm south of Wall Lake, Iowa along with her twin sister, Leola. Life was off to a slow start, weighing in at 2\1/2\ pounds at birth. She tells the story that she was so tiny, a coffee cup would fit over her head. But she survived and prospered in the Iowa countryside. She was later joined by several brothers and sisters. She went on to raise a family of six, which now includes a number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. All of them attest to her wonderful meals as a farm wife, noting that there is nothing much better than her homemade bread. Our world has changed a great deal during the course of Mrs. Petty's life. We have revolutionized air travel and walked on the moon. We have invented the television, cellular phones and the Internet. We have fought in wars overseas, seen the rise and fall of Soviet communism and witnessed the birth of new democracies. Mrs. Petty has lived through seventeen United States Presidents and twenty-four Governors of Iowa. In her lifetime, the population of the United States has more than tripled.

CREC-2016-04-21-pt1-PgE571-2,CREC-2016-04-21,114,IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEHEMIAH COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT FUND,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E571] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEHEMIAH COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT FUND ______ HON. DORIS O. MATSUI of california in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Nehemiah Community Reinvestment Fund as it celebrates the milestone of renovating over 500 properties. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this great organization for its contributions to the Sacramento region. The Nehemiah Community Reinvestment Fund (NCRF) is a nonprofit and federally-certified community development financial institution (CDFI). NCRF provides capital and technical assistance to organizations working to revitalize low-income neighborhoods and provide housing, services, and jobs to underserved people throughout the United States. Through creative, flexible financing and investments, NCRF makes capital available to community- and faith-based nonprofits, as well as mission- based for-profit organizations, that otherwise might be unable to obtain needed capital. NCRF was founded by Nehemiah Corporation of America, which provided the start-up capital that enabled NCRF to begin making loans and investments. In addition to its community development loan fluid, NCRF also developed the Nehemiah Sacramento Valley Fund, a triple bottom-line, real estate equity fund, to bring market-rate capital into low-income neighborhoods in the six county Sacramento region. In 2010, NCRF launched the Neighborhood Restoration Program in response to the foreclosure crisis. The mission of this program is to advance community revitalization by providing homeownership opportunities for low- and moderate-income families. Building on Nehemiah's long history of encouraging and facilitating responsible homeownership, Nehemiah acquires properties located in communities that are affordable to low- and moderate-income homebuyers. Once acquired, each house is renovated to exceed Federal Housing Administration lending standards, and marketed for sale exclusively to first time homebuyers and low- to moderate-income households. In 2012, Nehemiah created Roofs for Troops to benefit the men and women who serve and have served our country. Through Roofs for Troops, financial institutions donate foreclosed properties to NCRF. Properties are renovated to exceed Veterans Administration lending standards and are marketed for sale exclusively to veterans and active duty military. A percentage of properties NCRF receives and renovates are donated 100 percent mortgage free to deserving veteran and active duty military families. In total, the Nehemiah Community Reinvestment Fund has created 500 affordable homeownership opportunities through its Neighborhood Restoration and Roofs for Troops Programs.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Nehemiah Community Reinvestment Fund as it celebrates the milestone of renovating over 500 properties. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this great organization for its contributions to the Sacramento region. The Nehemiah Community Reinvestment Fund (NCRF) is a nonprofit and federally-certified community development financial institution (CDFI). NCRF provides capital and technical assistance to organizations working to revitalize low-income neighborhoods and provide housing, services, and jobs to underserved people throughout the United States. Through creative, flexible financing and investments, NCRF makes capital available to community- and faith-based nonprofits, as well as mission- based for-profit organizations, that otherwise might be unable to obtain needed capital. NCRF was founded by Nehemiah Corporation of America, which provided the start-up capital that enabled NCRF to begin making loans and investments. In addition to its community development loan fluid, NCRF also developed the Nehemiah Sacramento Valley Fund, a triple bottom-line, real estate equity fund, to bring market-rate capital into low-income neighborhoods in the six county Sacramento region. In 2010, NCRF launched the Neighborhood Restoration Program in response to the foreclosure crisis. The mission of this program is to advance community revitalization by providing homeownership opportunities for low- and moderate-income families. Building on Nehemiah's long history of encouraging and facilitating responsible homeownership, Nehemiah acquires properties located in communities that are affordable to low- and moderate-income homebuyers. Once acquired, each house is renovated to exceed Federal Housing Administration lending standards, and marketed for sale exclusively to first time homebuyers and low- to moderate-income households. In 2012, Nehemiah created Roofs for Troops to benefit the men and women who serve and have served our country. Through Roofs for Troops, financial institutions donate foreclosed properties to NCRF. Properties are renovated to exceed Veterans Administration lending standards and are marketed for sale exclusively to veterans and active duty military. A percentage of properties NCRF receives and renovates are donated 100 percent mortgage free to deserving veteran and active duty military families. In total, the Nehemiah Community Reinvestment Fund has created 500 affordable homeownership opportunities through its Neighborhood Restoration and Roofs for Troops Programs. Mr. Speaker, as community members gather to celebrate this significant milestone for the Nehemiah Community Reinvestment Fund, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Fund for its contributions and commitment to the Sacramento region. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E571] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEHEMIAH COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT FUND ______ HON.

DONNA F. EDWARDS of maryland in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to a fallen Maryland firefighter and recognize his colleague who is recovering from severe injuries. As the funeral and interment of this esteemed firefighter occurred yesterday, I want to remember the legacy he leaves behind. Prince George's County firefighter and paramedic (FF/Medic) John Ernest Ulmschneider was responding to a ``check on welfare'' call that took a turn for the worse. Known as ``Skillet,'' this brave firefighter died tragically in the line of duty on Friday, April 15, as a result of a shooting in Temple Hills, Maryland. Line-of-duty deaths are always difficult to bear. A firefighter or another first responder leaves their home, their station, or their vehicle to do their job of public service, and their loved one, coworker, or partner expects to see them return. My heart breaks for John's loved ones and for the tight-knit community that is the Prince George's County Fire and EMS Department. The details of FF/Medic Ulmschneider's death are heartbreaking. He, fellow firefighter Kevin Swain of the Morningside Volunteer Fire Department, and other first responders arrived at a residence after a relative had contacted them worried about the health of a family member. They knocked on the door a few times and announced themselves without receiving a response. With the concern of a potential health emergency in mind, they tried to enter the home by breaking down the door. It was a fateful decision. As the firefighters entered the home, the person inside fired a weapon, hitting FF/Medic Ulmschneider and FF Swain. Both firefighters were severely injured, FF/Medic Ulmschneider fatally, despite the rapid and capable care they received. On behalf of the citizens of Maryland's Fourth Congressional District, I would like to recognize the paramedics and the doctors and nurses for their compassionate care and treatment of these firefighters. I would like to remember the legacy FF/Medic Ulmschneider leaves behind. He was born in Baltimore and graduated from Surrattsville High School in Clinton, Maryland in 1997. Friends called him ``Skillet'' because his head was as tough as a cast iron skillet. FF/Medic Ulmschneider had been a member of the Prince George's County Fire Department for 13 years. He was married to Dawn and a proud and doting father to Abigail. One colleague of his remembers him as a particularly caring person who went the extra mile and on calls would make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for those patients who had low- blood sugar or were simply panicked. Another coworker recalled that FF/ Medic Ulmschneider had two speeds, ``fast and faster.'' Mr. Speaker, I want to send my appreciation to these individual firefighters and all their colleagues for their relentless dedication to public service. Prince George's County Fire/EMS Department and firefighters across this country are committed every day to keep our communities safe by putting their own lives at risk [[Page E572]] during times of our greatest need. They each have made the ultimate contribution to our communities--the contribution of personal sacrifice to ensure our safety and well-being. These men and women rightfully are our heroes. As a dedicated firefighter, husband, father, and human being, Firefighter and Paramedic John Ulmschneider deserves all of the honor and praise this Chamber can bestow upon him. On behalf of the 4th Congressional District and this House, I extend my sincerest gratitude and condolences to his wife Dawn and daughter Abigail; Cheryl Ulmschneider, his mother; his entire family; friends; Prince George's County Fire Chief Marc Bashoor; the entire Department; and the Prince George's County Professional Fire Fighters & Paramedics Association International Association of Fire Fighters Local 1619. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E571-E572] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN ULMSCHNEIDER ______ HON.

DAN NEWHOUSE of washington in the house of representatives Thursday, April 21, 2016 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce my legislation, the Port of Benton Restriction Release Act of 2016. This legislation will lift the conveyance restrictions on a 71.5 acre parcel of land that was deeded to the Port of Benton (Port) in 1996 by the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD). The Port acquired this parcel of land as part of an effort to transfer excess and unneeded land from the ``Former 3000 Area'' of the Hanford nuclear reservation, located in the Tri-Cities region of Central Washington, back to the local communities. Recently, the Port has explored economic development opportunities on this parcel, however the existing conveyance restrictions have inhibited their ability to develop the land for the economic benefit of the Tri-Cities region. In recent years, there has been an increase in economic activity near this property, including over $70 million in investments, the creation of the Manhattan Project National Historic Park in 2014, and the transfer of 1,641 acres of Hanford land back to the local communities for further economic and industrial development. The Port of Benton has targeted uses for this land that include clean energy manufacturing, bio products, solar array, and industrial operations, which could yield investments of $1 billion for the local communities and the creation of 1,500 jobs for the region. However, the conveyance restrictions on this property have inhibited the Port's ability to attract private and small businesses to make investments in the Former Hanford 3000 Area. These restrictions require that all sub-leases over five years on the property be submitted to MARAD for approval. Additionally, the Port is required to submit annual reports to MARAD for the parcel. This important legislation will release all remaining federal deed restrictions on the 71.5 acre property, which will allow the Port of Benton and the surrounding communities to continue their hard work to create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and retain a skilled workforce in the area, and this parcel of land is a critical component of this effort. For these reasons I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation, which will have a positive and lasting impact on the economic viability and competitiveness of the Tri-Cities region. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E572] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE PORT OF BENTON RESTRICTION RELEASE ACT OF 2016 ______ HON.

Recently, the Port has explored economic development opportunities on this parcel, however the existing conveyance restrictions have inhibited their ability to develop the land for the economic benefit of the Tri-Cities region. In recent years, there has been an increase in economic activity near this property, including over $70 million in investments, the creation of the Manhattan Project National Historic Park in 2014, and the transfer of 1,641 acres of Hanford land back to the local communities for further economic and industrial development. The Port of Benton has targeted uses for this land that include clean energy manufacturing, bio products, solar array, and industrial operations, which could yield investments of $1 billion for the local communities and the creation of 1,500 jobs for the region. However, the conveyance restrictions on this property have inhibited the Port's ability to attract private and small businesses to make investments in the Former Hanford 3000 Area. These restrictions require that all sub-leases over five years on the property be submitted to MARAD for approval. Additionally, the Port is required to submit annual reports to MARAD for the parcel. This important legislation will release all remaining federal deed restrictions on the 71.5 acre property, which will allow the Port of Benton and the surrounding communities to continue their hard work to create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and retain a skilled workforce in the area, and this parcel of land is a critical component of this effort. For these reasons I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation, which will have a positive and lasting impact on the economic viability and competitiveness of the Tri-Cities region. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 62 (Thursday, April 21, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E572] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE PORT OF BENTON RESTRICTION RELEASE ACT OF 2016 ______ HON.

In her ``spare time'' she volunteered many late afternoons calling shut-ins for the Major Hospital Foundation. Her philanthropic spirit and volunteerism didn't go unnoticed. In 2013, Governor Mike Pence awarded her a Distinguished Hoosier Award, which is one of the highest honors given by the State of Indiana. Judy also received two awards from the Shelby County Chamber of Commerce, including Citizen of the Year in 2000 and the Athena Award in 2014. Judy Runnebohm was also my friend. And, there is no better friend than Judy. She will always be remembered as loyal, honest and a fierce advocate for those she believed in. I will never forget her support and belief in me. Judy will certainly be missed by her family and her community. I will always be grateful for the encouragement and support that Judy and her husband Nick have given me throughout my career. And, I know the city of Shelbyville and the State of Indiana will always be grateful for their dedication. Today, it is my privilege to honor the life of Judy Runnebohm.

Born on September 27, 1936, to Thomas and Nell ``Morris'' Jenkins, Judy lived a long, full life dedicated to her family and her community. As the Good Book says in Acts 20:35, ``it is more blessed to give than to receive.'' And, Judy truly lived this scripture throughout her life. Everyone who knew her, knew of her love [[Page E573]] for Shelbyville and her desire to serve. Judy was a member of St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church, where she was an energetic contributor in the St. Vincent Altar Society. She served on the Board of Directors of SCUFFY, Shelby County Welfare, and Girls, Inc., and also served as secretary of the Shelby County Republican Central Committee. In her ``spare time'' she volunteered many late afternoons calling shut-ins for the Major Hospital Foundation. Her philanthropic spirit and volunteerism didn't go unnoticed. In 2013, Governor Mike Pence awarded her a Distinguished Hoosier Award, which is one of the highest honors given by the State of Indiana. Judy also received two awards from the Shelby County Chamber of Commerce, including Citizen of the Year in 2000 and the Athena Award in 2014. Judy Runnebohm was also my friend. And, there is no better friend than Judy. She will always be remembered as loyal, honest and a fierce advocate for those she believed in. I will never forget her support and belief in me. Judy will certainly be missed by her family and her community. I will always be grateful for the encouragement and support that Judy and her husband Nick have given me throughout my career. And, I know the city of Shelbyville and the State of Indiana will always be grateful for their dedication. Today, it is my privilege to honor the life of Judy Runnebohm. My thoughts and prayers go out to Judy's family, and may God comfort those she left behind with His peace and strength. ____________________",package_114_168.csv,2328,2328,2397,"[congressional record volume 162, number 62 (thursday, april 21, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e572-e573] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] tribute to julia c. ``judy'' runnebohm ______ hon. luke messer of indiana in the house of representatives thursday, april 21, 2016 mr. messer. mr. speaker, i rise today to pay tribute to the life of my good friend julia c. ``judy'' runnebohm of shelbyville, indiana. born on september 27, 1936, to thomas and nell ``morris'' jenkins, judy lived a long, full life dedicated to her family and her community. as the good book says in acts 20:35, ``it is more blessed to give than to receive.'' and, judy truly lived this scripture throughout her life. everyone who knew her, knew of her love [[page e573]] for shelbyville and her desire to serve. judy was a member of st. vincent de paul catholic church, where she was an energetic contributor in the st. vincent altar society. she served on the board of directors of scuffy, shelby county welfare, and girls, inc., and also served as secretary of the shelby county republican central committee. in her ``spare time'' she volunteered many late afternoons calling shut-ins for the major hospital foundation. her philanthropic spirit and volunteerism didn't go unnoticed. in 2013, governor mike pence awarded her a distinguished hoosier award, which is one of the highest honors given by the state of indiana. judy also received two awards from the shelby county chamber of commerce, including citizen of the year in 2000 and the athena award in 2014. judy runnebohm was also my friend. and, there is no better friend than judy. she will always be remembered as loyal, honest and a fierce advocate for those she believed in. i will never forget her support and belief in me. judy will certainly be missed by her family and her community. i will always be grateful for the encouragement and support that judy and her husband nick have given me throughout my career. and, i know the city of shelbyville and the state of indiana will always be grateful for their dedication. today, it is my privilege to honor the life of judy runnebohm. my thoughts and prayers go out to judy's family, and may god comfort those she left behind with his peace and strength. ____________________",2328
