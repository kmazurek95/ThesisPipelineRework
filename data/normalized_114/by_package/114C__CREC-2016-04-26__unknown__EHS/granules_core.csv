The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today is primary day in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast States, the so-called Acela Primary, the five States all served by Amtrak. Fortunately, we are going to get a break, briefly, from a primary season that is truly cringe-worthy. But for hundreds of people who were privileged to watch high school students from across America participate in the We the People constitutional competition, there is hope. These teenage scholars, most not old enough to vote or to drive, compete in a contest demonstrating their knowledge of the Constitution and democratic principles as well as their ability to think on their feet. At a time when civics education doesn't appear to be a priority for most of American education, this shows the appetite and the capacity to fill that gap. I have more than a little hometown pride in this undertaking. The Classroom Law Project has been a priority of my family for years and continues to be so. For the last 4 years, two public high schools in Portland, Oregon, have alternated the National Championship, with Lincoln High School finishing first in 2012 and 2014 and Grant High School in Portland winning the national trophy in 2013 and 2015. This year Oregon was able to send both teams to the national finals, and the pattern continued, as Lincoln won its third trophy in 5 years and Grant, given an opportunity to compete, finished third, an unprecedented accomplishment for one town's high schools. This amazing success speaks to the dedication of the young scholars and the amazing support of their families that was evident in the competition, the finals of which were held here in our Nation's Capital. Both teams have a core of volunteer coaches who are lawyers and judges, citizens who focus on these kids and civics. They care deeply. Having watched one of these young scholars several years ago in our household, I can testify to the intensity, the depth, and the passion for the Constitution and for our government. Time doesn't permit me to recognize all these outstanding young people and their mentors, the team that brought them here, but I must acknowledge the presence and advocacy of Peyton Chapman, the principal of Lincoln High School, their main coach, Steve Griffith, representative of all these amazing adults who invest so much in the young people, and Instructor George Ten Eych, because all of these programs rely on a dedicated professional in the classroom to make it happen. I had an opportunity on the floor of the House to meet with both of these teams late last week. Listening to their comments and questions, I celebrated their insights and hard work, their commitment, even as I wish we could have all of them on the floor of this House to elevate the discussion and deliberation, and I think they would add, frankly, to the decisionmaking. But until their time will come--and it can't come soon enough--in the meantime, we celebrate five consecutive National Championships for two public high schools in Portland, Oregon. Congratulations, Lincoln Cardinals, on your championship, and Grant High School, finishing third. Together, you have dominated this elite competition for 5 consecutive years. Congratulations. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Page H1947] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATIONS TO LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL AND GRANT HIGH SCHOOL CONSTITUTIONAL COMPETITION PARTICIPANTS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, so far this House of Representatives has done nothing to help the people of my hometown of Flint, Michigan. I left Flint this morning, and I left behind a city of 100,000 people who for 2 years now have not been able to drink the water coming out of their tap. It is a disaster, it is a public health crisis, and it demands a response not just from the State government, which clearly is principally responsible for what happened. The people of my hometown are American citizens and have a right to have their national government, the Federal Government, step in and help them in the moment of their greatest need. This is the job of the United States Congress. We have legislation that would provide relief to the people of Flint rather than arguing over blame. That will come in time. There has been plenty of time devoted to that subject. The legislation that I offer would have the Federal Government and the State government equally share in the cost of putting this community back together and getting the people in Flint, Michigan, something that every American ought to be able to get up in the morning and take for granted, and that is that the water they drink is clean, safe, and will not make them sick.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4096) to amend the Volcker Rule to permit certain investment advisers to share a similar name with a private equity fund, subject to certain restrictions, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4096 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Investor Clarity and Bank Parity Act''. SEC. 2. NAMING RESTRICTIONS. Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1851) is amended-- (1) in subsection (d)(1)(G)(vi), by inserting before the semicolon the following: ``, except that the hedge fund or private equity fund may share the same name or a variation of the same name as a banking entity that is an investment adviser to the hedge fund or private equity find, if-- ``(I) such investment adviser is not an insured depository institution, a company that controls an insured depository institution, or a company that is treated as a bank holding company for purposes of section 8 of the International Banking Act of 1978; ``(II) such investment adviser does not share the same name or a variation of the same name as an insured depository institution, any company that controls an insured depository institution, or any company that is treated as a bank holding company for purposes of section 8 of the International Banking Act of 1978; and ``(III) such name does not contain the word `bank' ''; and (2) in subsection (h)(5)(C), by inserting before the period the following: ``, except as permitted under subsection (d)(1)(G)(vi)''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. General Leave Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. GARRETT. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4096, the Investor Clarity and Bank Parity Act. I want to thank the primary sponsors of the legislation--the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers)--for their work in bringing this very technical, yet needed, legislation to the floor of the House today. Mr. Speaker, during this time of divided government, it may come as a surprise to some that the Committee on Financial Services has generated a significant amount of bipartisan legislation since the beginning of 2015. In fact, this Congress our committee has approved over 70 bills, with the vast majority of these receiving bipartisan support, and in many cases unanimous support. I am pleased that we are able to bring to the floor today a number of bills that received the backing of both Republicans and Democrats out of our committee. One of these bills is the Investor Clarity and Bank Parity Act, which passed out of the committee by a voice vote. What does that bill do? Well, this bill corrects a statutory error made in section 619 of Dodd-Frank, more commonly known as the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule limited the ability of bank holding companies or their affiliates to invest in hedge funds or private equity funds, collectively known as covered funds. Now, we had a number of debates in our committee as to the general wisdom of the Volcker Rule and whether it actually reduces systemic risk and protects taxpayers or not. I think one thing we can all agree on is that so long as section 619 is the law of the land, Congress should do what it can to limit any negative and unintended consequences of the Volcker Rule. Because of the way that Dodd-Frank was drafted, a bank or one of its affiliates was prohibited from sharing its name with a covered fund that it was invested in. By disallowing a covered fund to share a name with the sponsoring entity, this provision of the Volcker Rule could actually lead to more and widespread investor confusion about who is actually managing the assets of that particular fund. As Jeffrey Plunkett of Natixis Global Asset Management told our subcommittee at a hearing back in February, he said: ``We believe that compliance with the name-sharing prohibition of the Volcker Rule . . . risks confusion among investors and burdens firms that are affiliated with banks, leading to a lack of transparency for clients.'' So the fix envisioned here today in H.R. 4096 is really a simple one. It allows a covered fund to share its name with a sponsoring entity in order to provide clarity and transparency to the investor. I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4096. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I also rise to support H.R. 4096 for the exact reasons that Mr. Garrett just pointed out. I would like to be as clear as I can. I am a strong proponent and supporter of the Volcker Rule, and I would not support anything that would undermine that rule. That is not what this does. This is simply a clarification of an item that was never intended. Even as a supporter of that rule, this is not the outcome we intended. It is simply to clarify naming abilities by certain entities. I want to be also clear that nothing in this provision would allow something like the Bank of America Fund. You still cannot name it after a bank. These are subsidiaries of some banks. In this particular case, Natixis happens to be located in my district. They are the ones who brought this issue to my attention. They also happen to be affiliated with Loomis Sayles. Loomis Sayles is not a bank, but it is an affiliate of a bank. Therefore, Loomis Sayles would not be allowed to say this is a Loomis Sayles item. They have to call it some funny name, ABCD Fund or whatever it might be. That was never the intention of the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule was to make sure that the finances of this country and this world are as stable as possible so that people couldn't have conflicts of interest and on and on and on. This is a technical amendment, something that I strongly support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as the gentleman has yielded back, has no other speakers, I don't believe that we have any other speakers on this side of the aisle. I will close by saying thank you to the gentleman for working with us on this and a bunch of other legislation I also hope to bring to the floor sooner rather than later. I encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to support this bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4096. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. [[Page H1950]] Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

there was no objection. mr. garrett. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 4096, the investor clarity and bank parity act. i want to thank the primary sponsors of the legislation--the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. capuano) and the gentleman from ohio (mr. stivers)--for their work in bringing this very technical, yet needed, legislation to the floor of the house today. mr. speaker, during this time of divided government, it may come as a surprise to some that the committee on financial services has generated a significant amount of bipartisan legislation since the beginning of 2015. in fact, this congress our committee has approved over 70 bills, with the vast majority of these receiving bipartisan support, and in many cases unanimous support. i am pleased that we are able to bring to the floor today a number of bills that received the backing of both republicans and democrats out of our committee. one of these bills is the investor clarity and bank parity act, which passed out of the committee by a voice vote. what does that bill do? well, this bill corrects a statutory error made in section 619 of dodd-frank, more commonly known as the volcker rule. the volcker rule limited the ability of bank holding companies or their affiliates to invest in hedge funds or private equity funds, collectively known as covered funds. now, we had a number of debates in our committee as to the general wisdom of the volcker rule and whether it actually reduces systemic risk and protects taxpayers or not. i think one thing we can all agree on is that so long as section 619 is the law of the land, congress should do what it can to limit any negative and unintended consequences of the volcker rule. because of the way that dodd-frank was drafted, a bank or one of its affiliates was prohibited from sharing its name with a covered fund that it was invested in. by disallowing a covered fund to share a name with the sponsoring entity, this provision of the volcker rule could actually lead to more and widespread investor confusion about who is actually managing the assets of that particular fund. as jeffrey plunkett of natixis global asset management told our subcommittee at a hearing back in february, he said: ``we believe that compliance with the name-sharing prohibition of the volcker rule . . . risks confusion among investors and burdens firms that are affiliated with banks, leading to a lack of transparency for clients.'' so the fix envisioned here today in h.r. 4096 is really a simple one. it allows a covered fund to share its name with a sponsoring entity in order to provide clarity and transparency to the investor. i urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on h.r. 4096. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. capuano. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i also rise to support h.r. 4096 for the exact reasons that mr. garrett just pointed out. i would like to be as clear as i can. i am a strong proponent and supporter of the volcker rule, and i would not support anything that would undermine that rule. that is not what this does. this is simply a clarification of an item that was never intended. even as a supporter of that rule, this is not the outcome we intended. it is simply to clarify naming abilities by certain entities. i want to be also clear that nothing in this provision would allow something like the bank of america fund. you still cannot name it after a bank. these are subsidiaries of some banks. in this particular case, natixis happens to be located in my district. they are the ones who brought this issue to my attention. they also happen to be affiliated with loomis sayles. loomis sayles is not a bank, but it is an affiliate of a bank. therefore, loomis sayles would not be allowed to say this is a loomis sayles item. they have to call it some funny name, abcd fund or whatever it might be. that was never the intention of the volcker rule. the volcker rule was to make sure that the finances of this country and this world are as stable as possible so that people couldn't have conflicts of interest and on and on and on. this is a technical amendment, something that i strongly support. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. garrett. mr. speaker, inasmuch as the gentleman has yielded back, has no other speakers, i don't believe that we have any other speakers on this side of the aisle. i will close by saying thank you to the gentleman for working with us on this and a bunch of other legislation i also hope to bring to the floor sooner rather than later. i encourage members on both sides of the aisle to support this bipartisan piece of legislation. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from new jersey (mr. garrett) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 4096. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

General Leave Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any other extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5019, the Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 2016. I want to thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who will be speaking in a little bit, for his diligent work on this piece of legislation, as well as for his valued work and his input that he has brought all [[Page H1951]] year long to the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises. Mr. Speaker, one of the most positive developments in our economy over the last several decades is what has been dubbed the ``democratization'' of our capital markets. Because of the advances in technology and market competition, more Americans than ever have the ability to take control of their own investments and have access to products that used to be reserved for the rich and the professionals. The $200 trade has now become the $7 trade, and many investment funds have become more cost-effective over the years as well. One of these products is the exchange-traded fund or the ETF. What are ETFs? Well, ETFs are securities made up of a basket of stocks or bonds and which trade over an exchange like an individual stock. Because of their diversity and cost-effectiveness, they have become increasingly popular with investors. In fact, ETFs now hold roughly $2 trillion in assets, and some 5.7 million households hold ETFs as part of their investment portfolio. That being said, unfortunately, due to a longstanding technicality in securities law, there is a dearth of research on ETFs' availability to investors, depriving them of valuable information they need to make their informed decisions. The SEC, in the past, has provided safe harbors under securities law for brokers that provide research reports for listed stocks or corporate debt. Despite this and despite broad public support, the SEC has not provided a similar safe harbor for ETF research reports. Because of this, brokers are hesitant to publish reports out of fear for legal action either from the SEC or another private party. So we have this today, the Fair Access to Investment Research Act, which would correct this anomaly by providing a safe harbor for ETFs similar to the ones that currently exist for equities or corporate debt. This is a simple, yet much-needed, piece of legislation to help investors, particularly your mom-and-pop type investors, to understand more about the products that they are putting their hard-earned money into. Again, I thank Mr. Hill not only for his work on this legislation but, truly, for all the expertise and advice that he has brought to the committee this session. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Carney), the primary Democratic sponsor of this bill. Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) for yielding me this time. I would also like to thank all those who have worked hard to improve this bill. I would like to recognize and thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) for introducing this legislation. I appreciate his continued willingness to work with me on this important issue and to fine-tune this bill to address concerns that we have heard, particularly from Members on this side of the aisle. The FAIR Act has a very simple purpose, to provide investors better access to research on exchange-traded funds and other similar products. ETFs are one of the fastest-growing investment vehicles in the market. Net assets in ETFs have grown from $102 billion in 2002 to $1.8 trillion in 2014. The number of ETFs on the market has increased 23 percent over the same period of time, but compared to other asset classes, there is limited research about them available. As interest in ETFs continues to grow, we need to make sure that investors have access to reliable information on these funds and on their underlying investments. The SEC has been looking at expanding a safe harbor for ETF research for over 15 years, and every time this issue has come up before the SEC, it has received favorable feedback. In fact, during the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises hearing, there was unanimous agreement among the witnesses--which is not easy to come by in our subcommittee--that the SEC should promulgate a rule providing a safe harbor for ETF research. Since this legislation was originally introduced, a lot has gone into improving it. We have worked very closely with Ranking Member Waters, the SEC, and FINRA to ensure this legislation does what it is intended to do. We have taken their suggestions to improve numerous provisions of the bill, and I want to thank Mr. Hill again for his flexibility in doing that. This new version reflects a year of collaboration among Democrats, Republicans, and the regulators. The finished product is a clarified, more effective version of the original bill. I am proud to say I believe that we have arrived at an agreement that works for everyone. Again, I would like to thank Mr. Hill for his leadership on this issue. I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the sponsor of this legislation. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises. I appreciate greatly the kind comments, sponsorship, and good work of my friend, the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Carney). Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 5019, the FAIR Act, Fair Access to Investment Research Act. This bill is similar to a bill that I introduced with Mr. Carney that passed the House as a part of H.R. 1675 and passed our committee by a strong bipartisan vote. {time} 1515 As my friend from Delaware said, we have worked diligently to improve this legislation and we have worked carefully with our colleagues in the minority to make sure that this bill fully represents the bipartisan consensus on the intent of the FAIR Act. This bill is very simple: it allows broker-dealers involved in a distribution to issue research reports on the rapidly growing medium of the exchange-traded funds, or the ETF, market. Since I started my most recent investment firm in the late 1990s, I have personally seen the ETF market grow from about 100 funds and $100 billion in assets to over 1,400 funds and nearly $2 trillion in assets. And some reports predict an additional $1 trillion might shift into ETFs should the Department of Labor's recent fiduciary rule actually go into effect. Further, today's ETFs frequently are more complicated and require more analysis on the part of investors. Yet despite their rapid appreciation and growth in popularity and increasing importance to retail investors, most broker-dealers do not publish research on ETFs due to anomalies in the securities laws and regulations that Mr. Garrett so ably discussed. Throughout this process, there has been essentially universal support for increasing investor knowledge and access to information on ETFs-- that a safe harbor in this regard simply makes good sense. As Mr. Carney said, this issue is not unfamiliar to the Commission, as it has been raised both to the SEC and by the SEC several times over the past 17 years, most recently in 2004. As a part of its Securities Offering Reform proposal, the Commission requested comment on whether ``reliance on proposed rule 139 should be permitted if the issuer is an open-end management investment company or other investment company.'' The comments were universally supported, but the rule was never adopted. Given the importance of ETFs to today's market, steps to facilitate research and allow investors access to this useful information is long overdue. The FAIR Act directs the SEC to provide a safe harbor for research reports that cover ETFs so that these reports are not considered ``offers'' under section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. This mirrors other research safe harbors implemented by the SEC for other categories. The bill also helps the SEC organize, in my view, its ``50 front burners'' and holds it accountable to follow Congress' direction by requiring the Commission to finalize rules within 180 days or an interim safe harbor will take effect until the rule is proposed and finalized. With close to 6 million U.S. households holding ETFs, investors need access to this research to be [[Page H1952]] better informed and make better long-term investment decisions. Again, I would like to thank the chairman, Mr. Carney; Mrs. Maloney, the ranking member; and all of the staff on both the majority and minority side for working to develop this commonsense proposal to provide more information to American investors. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, having no further speakers at this time and appreciating the fact that this prioritizes the 50 front burners at the SEC, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5019. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1950-H1952] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAIR ACCESS TO INVESTMENT RESEARCH ACT OF 2016 Mr. GARRETT.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. General Leave Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any other extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5019, the Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 2016. I want to thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who will be speaking in a little bit, for his diligent work on this piece of legislation, as well as for his valued work and his input that he has brought all [[Page H1951]] year long to the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises. Mr. Speaker, one of the most positive developments in our economy over the last several decades is what has been dubbed the ``democratization'' of our capital markets. Because of the advances in technology and market competition, more Americans than ever have the ability to take control of their own investments and have access to products that used to be reserved for the rich and the professionals. The $200 trade has now become the $7 trade, and many investment funds have become more cost-effective over the years as well. One of these products is the exchange-traded fund or the ETF. What are ETFs? Well, ETFs are securities made up of a basket of stocks or bonds and which trade over an exchange like an individual stock. Because of their diversity and cost-effectiveness, they have become increasingly popular with investors. In fact, ETFs now hold roughly $2 trillion in assets, and some 5.7 million households hold ETFs as part of their investment portfolio. That being said, unfortunately, due to a longstanding technicality in securities law, there is a dearth of research on ETFs' availability to investors, depriving them of valuable information they need to make their informed decisions. The SEC, in the past, has provided safe harbors under securities law for brokers that provide research reports for listed stocks or corporate debt. Despite this and despite broad public support, the SEC has not provided a similar safe harbor for ETF research reports. Because of this, brokers are hesitant to publish reports out of fear for legal action either from the SEC or another private party. So we have this today, the Fair Access to Investment Research Act, which would correct this anomaly by providing a safe harbor for ETFs similar to the ones that currently exist for equities or corporate debt. This is a simple, yet much-needed, piece of legislation to help investors, particularly your mom-and-pop type investors, to understand more about the products that they are putting their hard-earned money into. Again, I thank Mr. Hill not only for his work on this legislation but, truly, for all the expertise and advice that he has brought to the committee this session. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Carney), the primary Democratic sponsor of this bill. Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) for yielding me this time. I would also like to thank all those who have worked hard to improve this bill. I would like to recognize and thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) for introducing this legislation. I appreciate his continued willingness to work with me on this important issue and to fine-tune this bill to address concerns that we have heard, particularly from Members on this side of the aisle. The FAIR Act has a very simple purpose, to provide investors better access to research on exchange-traded funds and other similar products. ETFs are one of the fastest-growing investment vehicles in the market. Net assets in ETFs have grown from $102 billion in 2002 to $1.8 trillion in 2014. The number of ETFs on the market has increased 23 percent over the same period of time, but compared to other asset classes, there is limited research about them available. As interest in ETFs continues to grow, we need to make sure that investors have access to reliable information on these funds and on their underlying investments. The SEC has been looking at expanding a safe harbor for ETF research for over 15 years, and every time this issue has come up before the SEC, it has received favorable feedback. In fact, during the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises hearing, there was unanimous agreement among the witnesses--which is not easy to come by in our subcommittee--that the SEC should promulgate a rule providing a safe harbor for ETF research. Since this legislation was originally introduced, a lot has gone into improving it. We have worked very closely with Ranking Member Waters, the SEC, and FINRA to ensure this legislation does what it is intended to do. We have taken their suggestions to improve numerous provisions of the bill, and I want to thank Mr. Hill again for his flexibility in doing that. This new version reflects a year of collaboration among Democrats, Republicans, and the regulators. The finished product is a clarified, more effective version of the original bill. I am proud to say I believe that we have arrived at an agreement that works for everyone. Again, I would like to thank Mr. Hill for his leadership on this issue. I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the sponsor of this legislation. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises. I appreciate greatly the kind comments, sponsorship, and good work of my friend, the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Carney). Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 5019, the FAIR Act, Fair Access to Investment Research Act. This bill is similar to a bill that I introduced with Mr. Carney that passed the House as a part of H.R. 1675 and passed our committee by a strong bipartisan vote. {time} 1515 As my friend from Delaware said, we have worked diligently to improve this legislation and we have worked carefully with our colleagues in the minority to make sure that this bill fully represents the bipartisan consensus on the intent of the FAIR Act. This bill is very simple: it allows broker-dealers involved in a distribution to issue research reports on the rapidly growing medium of the exchange-traded funds, or the ETF, market. Since I started my most recent investment firm in the late 1990s, I have personally seen the ETF market grow from about 100 funds and $100 billion in assets to over 1,400 funds and nearly $2 trillion in assets. And some reports predict an additional $1 trillion might shift into ETFs should the Department of Labor's recent fiduciary rule actually go into effect. Further, today's ETFs frequently are more complicated and require more analysis on the part of investors. Yet despite their rapid appreciation and growth in popularity and increasing importance to retail investors, most broker-dealers do not publish research on ETFs due to anomalies in the securities laws and regulations that Mr. Garrett so ably discussed. Throughout this process, there has been essentially universal support for increasing investor knowledge and access to information on ETFs-- that a safe harbor in this regard simply makes good sense. As Mr. Carney said, this issue is not unfamiliar to the Commission, as it has been raised both to the SEC and by the SEC several times over the past 17 years, most recently in 2004. As a part of its Securities Offering Reform proposal, the Commission requested comment on whether ``reliance on proposed rule 139 should be permitted if the issuer is an open-end management investment company or other investment company.'' The comments were universally supported, but the rule was never adopted. Given the importance of ETFs to today's market, steps to facilitate research and allow investors access to this useful information is long overdue. The FAIR Act directs the SEC to provide a safe harbor for research reports that cover ETFs so that these reports are not considered ``offers'' under section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. This mirrors other research safe harbors implemented by the SEC for other categories. The bill also helps the SEC organize, in my view, its ``50 front burners'' and holds it accountable to follow Congress' direction by requiring the Commission to finalize rules within 180 days or an interim safe harbor will take effect until the rule is proposed and finalized. With close to 6 million U.S. households holding ETFs, investors need access to this research to be [[Page H1952]] better informed and make better long-term investment decisions. Again, I would like to thank the chairman, Mr. Carney; Mrs. Maloney, the ranking member; and all of the staff on both the majority and minority side for working to develop this commonsense proposal to provide more information to American investors. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, having no further speakers at this time and appreciating the fact that this prioritizes the 50 front burners at the SEC, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5019. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1950-H1952] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAIR ACCESS TO INVESTMENT RESEARCH ACT OF 2016 Mr. GARRETT.

to the rule, the gentleman from new jersey (mr. garrett) and the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. capuano) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from new jersey. general leave mr. garrett. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any other extraneous material on this bill. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new jersey? there was no objection. mr. garrett. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 5019, the fair access to investment research act of 2016. i want to thank the gentleman from arkansas (mr. hill), who will be speaking in a little bit, for his diligent work on this piece of legislation, as well as for his valued work and his input that he has brought all [[page h1951]] year long to the subcommittee on capital markets and government sponsored enterprises. mr. speaker, one of the most positive developments in our economy over the last several decades is what has been dubbed the ``democratization'' of our capital markets. because of the advances in technology and market competition, more americans than ever have the ability to take control of their own investments and have access to products that used to be reserved for the rich and the professionals. the $200 trade has now become the $7 trade, and many investment funds have become more cost-effective over the years as well. one of these products is the exchange-traded fund or the etf. what are etfs? well, etfs are securities made up of a basket of stocks or bonds and which trade over an exchange like an individual stock. because of their diversity and cost-effectiveness, they have become increasingly popular with investors. in fact, etfs now hold roughly $2 trillion in assets, and some 5.7 million households hold etfs as part of their investment portfolio. that being said, unfortunately, due to a longstanding technicality in securities law, there is a dearth of research on etfs' availability to investors, depriving them of valuable information they need to make their informed decisions. the sec, in the past, has provided safe harbors under securities law for brokers that provide research reports for listed stocks or corporate debt. despite this and despite broad public support, the sec has not provided a similar safe harbor for etf research reports. because of this, brokers are hesitant to publish reports out of fear for legal action either from the sec or another private party. so we have this today, the fair access to investment research act, which would correct this anomaly by providing a safe harbor for etfs similar to the ones that currently exist for equities or corporate debt. this is a simple, yet much-needed, piece of legislation to help investors, particularly your mom-and-pop type investors, to understand more about the products that they are putting their hard-earned money into. again, i thank mr. hill not only for his work on this legislation but, truly, for all the expertise and advice that he has brought to the committee this session. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. capuano. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from delaware (mr. carney), the primary democratic sponsor of this bill. mr. carney. mr. speaker, first i want to thank the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. capuano) for yielding me this time. i would also like to thank all those who have worked hard to improve this bill. i would like to recognize and thank the gentleman from arkansas (mr. hill) for introducing this legislation. i appreciate his continued willingness to work with me on this important issue and to fine-tune this bill to address concerns that we have heard, particularly from members on this side of the aisle. the fair act has a very simple purpose, to provide investors better access to research on exchange-traded funds and other similar products. etfs are one of the fastest-growing investment vehicles in the market. net assets in etfs have grown from $102 billion in 2002 to $1.8 trillion in 2014. the number of etfs on the market has increased 23 percent over the same period of time, but compared to other asset classes, there is limited research about them available. as interest in etfs continues to grow, we need to make sure that investors have access to reliable information on these funds and on their underlying investments. the sec has been looking at expanding a safe harbor for etf research for over 15 years, and every time this issue has come up before the sec, it has received favorable feedback. in fact, during the subcommittee on capital markets and government sponsored enterprises hearing, there was unanimous agreement among the witnesses--which is not easy to come by in our subcommittee--that the sec should promulgate a rule providing a safe harbor for etf research. since this legislation was originally introduced, a lot has gone into improving it. we have worked very closely with ranking member waters, the sec, and finra to ensure this legislation does what it is intended to do. we have taken their suggestions to improve numerous provisions of the bill, and i want to thank mr. hill again for his flexibility in doing that. this new version reflects a year of collaboration among democrats, republicans, and the regulators. the finished product is a clarified, more effective version of the original bill. i am proud to say i believe that we have arrived at an agreement that works for everyone. again, i would like to thank mr. hill for his leadership on this issue. i urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation. mr. garrett. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from arkansas (mr. hill), the sponsor of this legislation. mr. hill. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from new jersey for his leadership of the subcommittee on capital markets and government sponsored enterprises. i appreciate greatly the kind comments, sponsorship, and good work of my friend, the gentleman from delaware (mr. carney). mr. speaker, today i rise in support of h.r. 5019, the fair act, fair access to investment research act. this bill is similar to a bill that i introduced with mr. carney that passed the house as a part of h.r. 1675 and passed our committee by a strong bipartisan vote. {time} 1515 as my friend from delaware said, we have worked diligently to improve this legislation and we have worked carefully with our colleagues in the minority to make sure that this bill fully represents the bipartisan consensus on the intent of the fair act. this bill is very simple: it allows broker-dealers involved in a distribution to issue research reports on the rapidly growing medium of the exchange-traded funds, or the etf, market. since i started my most recent investment firm in the late 1990s, i have personally seen the etf market grow from about 100 funds and $100 billion in assets to over 1,400 funds and nearly $2 trillion in assets. and some reports predict an additional $1 trillion might shift into etfs should the department of labor's recent fiduciary rule actually go into effect. further, today's etfs frequently are more complicated and require more analysis on the part of investors. yet despite their rapid appreciation and growth in popularity and increasing importance to retail investors, most broker-dealers do not publish research on etfs due to anomalies in the securities laws and regulations that mr. garrett so ably discussed. throughout this process, there has been essentially universal support for increasing investor knowledge and access to information on etfs-- that a safe harbor in this regard simply makes good sense. as mr. carney said, this issue is not unfamiliar to the commission, as it has been raised both to the sec and by the sec several times over the past 17 years, most recently in 2004. as a part of its securities offering reform proposal, the commission requested comment on whether ``reliance on proposed rule 139 should be permitted if the issuer is an open-end management investment company or other investment company.'' the comments were universally supported, but the rule was never adopted. given the importance of etfs to today's market, steps to facilitate research and allow investors access to this useful information is long overdue. the fair act directs the sec to provide a safe harbor for research reports that cover etfs so that these reports are not considered ``offers'' under section 5 of the securities act of 1933. this mirrors other research safe harbors implemented by the sec for other categories. the bill also helps the sec organize, in my view, its ``50 front burners'' and holds it accountable to follow congress' direction by requiring the commission to finalize rules within 180 days or an interim safe harbor will take effect until the rule is proposed and finalized. with close to 6 million u.s. households holding etfs, investors need access to this research to be [[page h1952]] better informed and make better long-term investment decisions. again, i would like to thank the chairman, mr. carney; mrs. maloney, the ranking member; and all of the staff on both the majority and minority side for working to develop this commonsense proposal to provide more information to american investors. i encourage all of my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. mr. capuano. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. garrett. mr. speaker, having no further speakers at this time and appreciating the fact that this prioritizes the 50 front burners at the sec, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from new jersey (mr. garrett) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 5019. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. garrett. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",19404

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Providing American homeowners and businessowners more affordable consumer options in the flood insurance marketplace has been one of my top priorities since I was elected to Congress to represent central Florida and the Tampa Bay region in our Nation's Capital. Private competition in this market will lead to greater innovation and more affordable and comprehensive policies for consumers. We have seen numerous floods devastating communities across the country in recent years, most recently in Houston, and last August in my very own congressional district. Every State and every congressional district is at risk for flooding. With hurricane season just a few weeks away from beginning, it is time for Congress to take action to benefit and better protect consumers. Unfortunately, regulatory barriers and the bias of regulators favoring National Flood Insurance Program policies have prevented the development of a private flood insurance marketplace. This was not the intention of the Biggert-Waters Act. Rather, it was an unintended consequence. With that in mind, I worked with my colleague from across the aisle, Representative Patrick Murphy, to introduce H.R. 2901, the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act. This bipartisan legislation will remove the unnecessary regulatory barriers and require Federal agencies to accept private flood insurance that complies with the laws and regulations of the State of an insured property. Under current law, consumers are limited to the coverage options provided by the NFIP. For example, an NFIP policy only covers up to $250,000 of damages related to a residential home. In addition, an NFIP policy does not cover a homeowner's living expenses, such as temporary housing, if they are displaced as a result of a flood. In the case of a business, an NFIP policy does not provide coverage for the financial losses suffered by businesses as a result of a flood. While the NFIP is limited in what their policies can cover, the private sector is not. The private sector will provide more incentives for property owners to invest in mitigation and resiliency. Ultimately, this increased emphasis on mitigation will benefit homeowners and taxpayers alike. Studies have shown that, for every $1 of investment in mitigation, communities see a savings of up to $4 in government-funded disaster relief. I want to take a moment and thank Chairman Hensarling and my subcommittee chair, Blaine Luetkemeyer, for their support of this legislation and their leadership on this important issue. I also want to thank the ranking member, Maxine Waters, for working with my staff and me through this entire process. This legislation is supported by a number of stakeholders, from the Realtors, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, to a broad coalition of taxpayer advocates, environmental groups, housing organizations, and mitigation advocates. On March 2, 2016, the legislation passed out of the House Financial Services Committee by a vote of 53-0. With such strong bipartisan support, I am encouraged Congress is taking such an important step on behalf of consumers not only in Florida, but across the country. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in passing this commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will encourage the expansion of a well-regulated, more affordable private flood insurance option for homeowners. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, H.R. 2901, and I want to congratulate Mr. Ross and Mr. Murphy for coming up with a piece of bipartisan legislation. I want to be clear that the issues surrounding flood insurance are difficult and complicated, and there are differences of opinion as to how much of a role private insurance can play. This bill threads that needle. This bill says we all agree that there is more role for private insurance and we should remove any barriers that might be there so that people can be better served and have better competition. I think this bill does a pretty good job doing that. I don't think private insurance is ever going to--I am not sure that is possible, but it is a different debate--take the place of national flood insurance. And we are working on that. Mr. Ross has been a great leader on that, as has Mr. Murphy. I want to thank them and congratulate them, and I look forward to working with them further to do more as we move forward. This particular bill is one good step in the right direction, and I want to congratulate the two authors and thank them for their leadership. I look forward to supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce). Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation, the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act. Since its inception back in 1968, the National Flood Insurance Program was never intended to cover policies that the private sector was able and willing to underwrite. In fact, one stated goal for the program was ``the Federal Government would create an opportunity for private industry to obtain . . . experience in operating a flood insurance program . . . and that sometime in the future, the program could become an all-private program.'' Nearly 50 years have passed and, to no one's surprise, private sector flood insurance risk modeling and analytics have dramatically improved. While this House may not be ready to take up complete privatization, it is time to provide a role for the private market to underwrite primary flood insurance policies. Passage of this bipartisan bill means more consumer choice, more market competition, and more product information. Consumers, for the first time, will be able to shop for a flood policy that fits their particular needs. This bill also has the added benefit of decreasing the aggregate flood insurance exposure to the Federal Government and decreasing the potential for a future taxpayer-backed bailout, which is very, very important. So I commend both gentlemen for their work on this important issue, and [[Page H1954]] I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), my good friend. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding time to me. You might wonder: Why is someone from New Mexico even speaking about flood insurance problems? We get about 9 inches of rain a year in my district. Also, it is the high desert. They call it that because we begin at around 3,500 feet of elevation and work up from there. The way the National Flood Insurance Program has worked out in the past is that people are required, because they happen to be in a flood plain--and we are not dealing with whether or not they should be in a flood plain; we are dealing with the fact that they get no competitive bids--to only get the one government-size bid. And that is never very functional. So the most egregious circumstance that exists is one that one of my constituents mentioned. He said: I live at the top of a 7,000-foot mountain. The water is down here at about 4,000 feet, 3,000 feet below me, and I have to buy flood insurance. Well, the fact that he has to buy flood insurance is egregious enough, but the fact that he has to live and pay premiums based on the actuary standards that might exist in Florida is the egregious part. What it does is keeps houses from selling and people from being able to buy houses in New Mexico because they have been defined as being in a flood plain. {time} 1530 If the market were out there, there would be companies that say: Wait. That guy is never going to flood. I can charge him a minute amount and still make money on his policy. Yet, nothing like that exists. So we find ourselves paying to the same standards as the people in Florida pay when we get 9 inches of rain a year. So I really appreciate the gentleman's attempt to bring some competition into the workplace. I appreciate Mr. Capuano's support of the bill, Mr. Murphy's underlying co-sponsorship. I am here to support heartily H.R. 2901, the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, you learn something new every day. I am one of those people. I never expected a guy from New Mexico to be speaking on the flood insurance bill. I thank Mr. Pearce for educating me even further. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) for his efforts and leadership in this regard. Look, this isn't the be-all-to-end-all, but it is the best first step that we can have as a Congress to make sure that we give our consumers affordable options in flood insurance. As we address the reauthorization of the Biggert-Waters Act next year, this will provide a bridge for bringing the private sector back into the market to show that they are willing to assume some of this risk to the benefit of the consumers. There are quite a few groups out there that support this particular legislation. To name a few, that includes the Reinsurance Association of America, National Multifamily Housing Council, National Apartment Association, National Taxpayers Union, American Insurance Association, National Association of Realtors, Mortgage Bankers Association, and R Street. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us and overwhelmingly pass this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hill). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2901, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1952-H1954] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FLOOD INSURANCE MARKET PARITY AND MODERNIZATION ACT Mr. ROSS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Providing American homeowners and businessowners more affordable consumer options in the flood insurance marketplace has been one of my top priorities since I was elected to Congress to represent central Florida and the Tampa Bay region in our Nation's Capital. Private competition in this market will lead to greater innovation and more affordable and comprehensive policies for consumers. We have seen numerous floods devastating communities across the country in recent years, most recently in Houston, and last August in my very own congressional district. Every State and every congressional district is at risk for flooding. With hurricane season just a few weeks away from beginning, it is time for Congress to take action to benefit and better protect consumers. Unfortunately, regulatory barriers and the bias of regulators favoring National Flood Insurance Program policies have prevented the development of a private flood insurance marketplace. This was not the intention of the Biggert-Waters Act. Rather, it was an unintended consequence. With that in mind, I worked with my colleague from across the aisle, Representative Patrick Murphy, to introduce H.R. 2901, the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act. This bipartisan legislation will remove the unnecessary regulatory barriers and require Federal agencies to accept private flood insurance that complies with the laws and regulations of the State of an insured property. Under current law, consumers are limited to the coverage options provided by the NFIP. For example, an NFIP policy only covers up to $250,000 of damages related to a residential home. In addition, an NFIP policy does not cover a homeowner's living expenses, such as temporary housing, if they are displaced as a result of a flood. In the case of a business, an NFIP policy does not provide coverage for the financial losses suffered by businesses as a result of a flood. While the NFIP is limited in what their policies can cover, the private sector is not. The private sector will provide more incentives for property owners to invest in mitigation and resiliency. Ultimately, this increased emphasis on mitigation will benefit homeowners and taxpayers alike. Studies have shown that, for every $1 of investment in mitigation, communities see a savings of up to $4 in government-funded disaster relief. I want to take a moment and thank Chairman Hensarling and my subcommittee chair, Blaine Luetkemeyer, for their support of this legislation and their leadership on this important issue. I also want to thank the ranking member, Maxine Waters, for working with my staff and me through this entire process. This legislation is supported by a number of stakeholders, from the Realtors, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, to a broad coalition of taxpayer advocates, environmental groups, housing organizations, and mitigation advocates. On March 2, 2016, the legislation passed out of the House Financial Services Committee by a vote of 53-0. With such strong bipartisan support, I am encouraged Congress is taking such an important step on behalf of consumers not only in Florida, but across the country. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in passing this commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will encourage the expansion of a well-regulated, more affordable private flood insurance option for homeowners. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, H.R. 2901, and I want to congratulate Mr. Ross and Mr. Murphy for coming up with a piece of bipartisan legislation. I want to be clear that the issues surrounding flood insurance are difficult and complicated, and there are differences of opinion as to how much of a role private insurance can play. This bill threads that needle. This bill says we all agree that there is more role for private insurance and we should remove any barriers that might be there so that people can be better served and have better competition. I think this bill does a pretty good job doing that. I don't think private insurance is ever going to--I am not sure that is possible, but it is a different debate--take the place of national flood insurance. And we are working on that. Mr. Ross has been a great leader on that, as has Mr. Murphy. I want to thank them and congratulate them, and I look forward to working with them further to do more as we move forward. This particular bill is one good step in the right direction, and I want to congratulate the two authors and thank them for their leadership. I look forward to supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce). Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation, the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act. Since its inception back in 1968, the National Flood Insurance Program was never intended to cover policies that the private sector was able and willing to underwrite.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Providing American homeowners and businessowners more affordable consumer options in the flood insurance marketplace has been one of my top priorities since I was elected to Congress to represent central Florida and the Tampa Bay region in our Nation's Capital. Private competition in this market will lead to greater innovation and more affordable and comprehensive policies for consumers. We have seen numerous floods devastating communities across the country in recent years, most recently in Houston, and last August in my very own congressional district. Every State and every congressional district is at risk for flooding. With hurricane season just a few weeks away from beginning, it is time for Congress to take action to benefit and better protect consumers. Unfortunately, regulatory barriers and the bias of regulators favoring National Flood Insurance Program policies have prevented the development of a private flood insurance marketplace. This was not the intention of the Biggert-Waters Act. Rather, it was an unintended consequence. With that in mind, I worked with my colleague from across the aisle, Representative Patrick Murphy, to introduce H.R. 2901, the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act. This bipartisan legislation will remove the unnecessary regulatory barriers and require Federal agencies to accept private flood insurance that complies with the laws and regulations of the State of an insured property. Under current law, consumers are limited to the coverage options provided by the NFIP. For example, an NFIP policy only covers up to $250,000 of damages related to a residential home. In addition, an NFIP policy does not cover a homeowner's living expenses, such as temporary housing, if they are displaced as a result of a flood. In the case of a business, an NFIP policy does not provide coverage for the financial losses suffered by businesses as a result of a flood. While the NFIP is limited in what their policies can cover, the private sector is not. The private sector will provide more incentives for property owners to invest in mitigation and resiliency. Ultimately, this increased emphasis on mitigation will benefit homeowners and taxpayers alike. Studies have shown that, for every $1 of investment in mitigation, communities see a savings of up to $4 in government-funded disaster relief. I want to take a moment and thank Chairman Hensarling and my subcommittee chair, Blaine Luetkemeyer, for their support of this legislation and their leadership on this important issue. I also want to thank the ranking member, Maxine Waters, for working with my staff and me through this entire process. This legislation is supported by a number of stakeholders, from the Realtors, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, to a broad coalition of taxpayer advocates, environmental groups, housing organizations, and mitigation advocates. On March 2, 2016, the legislation passed out of the House Financial Services Committee by a vote of 53-0. With such strong bipartisan support, I am encouraged Congress is taking such an important step on behalf of consumers not only in Florida, but across the country. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in passing this commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will encourage the expansion of a well-regulated, more affordable private flood insurance option for homeowners. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, H.R. 2901, and I want to congratulate Mr. Ross and Mr. Murphy for coming up with a piece of bipartisan legislation. I want to be clear that the issues surrounding flood insurance are difficult and complicated, and there are differences of opinion as to how much of a role private insurance can play. This bill threads that needle. This bill says we all agree that there is more role for private insurance and we should remove any barriers that might be there so that people can be better served and have better competition. I think this bill does a pretty good job doing that. I don't think private insurance is ever going to--I am not sure that is possible, but it is a different debate--take the place of national flood insurance. And we are working on that. Mr. Ross has been a great leader on that, as has Mr. Murphy. I want to thank them and congratulate them, and I look forward to working with them further to do more as we move forward. This particular bill is one good step in the right direction, and I want to congratulate the two authors and thank them for their leadership. I look forward to supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce). Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation, the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act. Since its inception back in 1968, the National Flood Insurance Program was never intended to cover policies that the private sector was able and willing to underwrite. In fact, one stated goal for the program was ``the Federal Government would create an opportunity for private industry to obtain . . . experience in operating a flood insurance program . . . and that sometime in the future, the program could become an all-private program.'' Nearly 50 years have passed and, to no one's surprise, private sector flood insurance risk modeling and analytics have dramatically improved. While this House may not be ready to take up complete privatization, it is time to provide a role for the private market to underwrite primary flood insurance policies. Passage of this bipartisan bill means more consumer choice, more market competition, and more product information. Consumers, for the first time, will be able to shop for a flood policy that fits their particular needs. This bill also has the added benefit of decreasing the aggregate flood insurance exposure to the Federal Government and decreasing the potential for a future taxpayer-backed bailout, which is very, very important. So I commend both gentlemen for their work on this important issue, and [[Page H1954]] I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), my good friend. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding time to me. You might wonder: Why is someone from New Mexico even speaking about flood insurance problems? We get about 9 inches of rain a year in my district. Also, it is the high desert. They call it that because we begin at around 3,500 feet of elevation and work up from there. The way the National Flood Insurance Program has worked out in the past is that people are required, because they happen to be in a flood plain--and we are not dealing with whether or not they should be in a flood plain; we are dealing with the fact that they get no competitive bids--to only get the one government-size bid. And that is never very functional. So the most egregious circumstance that exists is one that one of my constituents mentioned. He said: I live at the top of a 7,000-foot mountain. The water is down here at about 4,000 feet, 3,000 feet below me, and I have to buy flood insurance. Well, the fact that he has to buy flood insurance is egregious enough, but the fact that he has to live and pay premiums based on the actuary standards that might exist in Florida is the egregious part. What it does is keeps houses from selling and people from being able to buy houses in New Mexico because they have been defined as being in a flood plain. {time} 1530 If the market were out there, there would be companies that say: Wait. That guy is never going to flood. I can charge him a minute amount and still make money on his policy. Yet, nothing like that exists. So we find ourselves paying to the same standards as the people in Florida pay when we get 9 inches of rain a year. So I really appreciate the gentleman's attempt to bring some competition into the workplace. I appreciate Mr. Capuano's support of the bill, Mr. Murphy's underlying co-sponsorship. I am here to support heartily H.R. 2901, the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, you learn something new every day. I am one of those people. I never expected a guy from New Mexico to be speaking on the flood insurance bill. I thank Mr. Pearce for educating me even further. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) for his efforts and leadership in this regard. Look, this isn't the be-all-to-end-all, but it is the best first step that we can have as a Congress to make sure that we give our consumers affordable options in flood insurance. As we address the reauthorization of the Biggert-Waters Act next year, this will provide a bridge for bringing the private sector back into the market to show that they are willing to assume some of this risk to the benefit of the consumers. There are quite a few groups out there that support this particular legislation. To name a few, that includes the Reinsurance Association of America, National Multifamily Housing Council, National Apartment Association, National Taxpayers Union, American Insurance Association, National Association of Realtors, Mortgage Bankers Association, and R Street. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us and overwhelmingly pass this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hill). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2901, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,22087,22087,22155,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [house] [pages h1952-h1954] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] flood insurance market parity and modernization act mr. ross. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 2901) to amend the flood disaster protection act of 1973 to require that certain buildings and personal property be covered by flood insurance, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 2901 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``flood insurance market parity and modernization act''. sec. 2. private flood insurance.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 223, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to bring up H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016, introduced by my Ohio colleague, Congressman Dave Joyce, on the floor today. The Great Lakes are an important resource for the United States. More than 30 million people live in the Great Lakes region, and the lakes help support over $200 billion a year in economic activity. The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force of Federal agencies was created in 2004 by executive order to help ensure coordination between the Federal, State, and private parties protecting and restoring the Great Lakes. In 2010, the task force released an action plan as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to accelerate efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes. Under the Initiative, the Environmental Protection Agency collaborates with other Federal partners, including the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, to select the best combination of projects and activities for Great Lakes protection and restoration. In September of 2014, the Federal agencies released an updated Action Plan II, which summarizes the actions that the Federal agencies plan to implement during fiscal years 2015 through 2019. The Action Plan aims to strategically target the biggest threats to the Great Lakes ecosystem and to accelerate progress toward long-term goals. H.R. 223 will formally authorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative for 5 years and modifies the program based on recommendations that the Committee received from stakeholders, hearings, and the GAO reports on EPA's activities during multiple years of oversight. The bill is a positive step forward for the Great Lakes region and the United States as a whole as we continue to prioritize protection and restoration of one of our Nation's most valuable resources. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016. This bill extends the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program which has had bipartisan support among the Great Lakes delegation for 5 years. I want to thank my colleagues, Representatives David Joyce, Dan Lipinski, and Rick Nolan, for their hard work and effort to extend the authorization of appropriations for this program through fiscal year 2021. These and other members of the Midwest delegation worked diligently to get this legislation to the floor for consideration. I want to thank them all for a job well done. It accelerates efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes, the largest system of surface freshwater in the world. Through unprecedented Federal agency coordination and the development of partnerships with the Great Lakes States and local communities, the initiative has already funded more than 2,000 projects to improve water quality, protect and restore native habitats, and prevent and control invasive species in the Great Lakes. Mr. Speaker, legislation similar to this bill was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. However, that authorization was only for 1 fiscal year. This legislation provides for a full 5-year reauthorization. That timeline is necessary to allow many longer term projects to be planned, capitalized, and completed. Further, this bill will allow States and local communities to coordinate their efforts to combat harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes for the first time. The harmful algal blooms that shut down the drinking water system in Toledo, Ohio, for 3 days in 2014 and that re-emerged in 2015 are still fresh in our memories. For this reason, I am pleased that this legislation includes the text of H.R. 1923, sponsored by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), to require EPA to appoint a Federal coordinator to work with the Federal agencies, the States, the tribes, and other stakeholders to address the recurring challenges of algal blooms in the Great Lakes. This coordinator will ensure that GLRI funds are utilized in the most efficient and effective way to reduce nutrients finding their way into the lakes. Lastly, this bill includes a savings clause to clarify that the GLRI authorization does not expand the regulatory authority of EPA related to restoration of the Great Lakes. I did not advocate for this provision. However, let's make it clear here today on the floor that this language should not be interpreted as preventing EPA or other Federal agencies from continuing to utilize their existing authorities to address ongoing water quality challenges facing the lakes. Accordingly, this bill should help ensure that the Federal departments are able to fund work using all the existing tools in the toolbox that cause harmful algal blooms and other pollution and prevent Asian carp from invading the lakes, which would be a disaster, and clean up areas of concern and other high-priority threats. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 223. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Ohio [[Page H1956]] (Mr. Joyce), who has been a strong advocate for the protection of the Great Lakes and a sponsor of the bill. Mr. JOYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016. First, I want to thank my good friend, Bob Gibbs of Ohio, for helping me to shepherd this legislation through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I also want to thank Chairman Shuster for lending a hand and providing guidance on this. Now, I know I may sound like a broken record, but one of the greatest natural resources and economic powerhouses we have in the United States and the world, for that matter, is the Great Lakes. I think the resource is incredibly important because, in the future, freshwater is going to be the new gold. And, if you believe that like I do, you understand why the Great Lakes are so important. Let me give you a few quick facts about this treasure. The Great Lakes contains one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water. The Great Lakes contain about 85 percent of the fresh surface water in North America. In the U.S., the Great Lakes account for 95 percent of the fresh surface water. That is a lot of fresh water. If you took the water and spread it evenly across the Continental United States, the Great Lakes would submerge our country under 9\1/2\ feet of water. These lakes provide more than 35 million people with their drinking water. These Great Lakes support more than 3,500 species of plants and animals. Studies have shown that more than 1\1/2\ million jobs are connected to the five lakes, and they generate $62 billion in wages. Now, I know I have uttered those facts around the Capitol like a broken record since I got here, as have others, but these are powerful in telling our story. An investment in protecting this national treasure is a small down payment in protecting the drinking water for millions of people. This legislation will continue to make sure that we look at these Great Lakes as a national treasure and coordinate our investment in protecting them. Please stand with me today in sending a message to protect and preserve our Great Lakes. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan). Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I also thank my colleagues from Ohio. This has been one of the true bipartisan issues that we have dealt with. So I would like to thank Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Joyce, Ms. Kaptur, Marcia Fudge, Jim Renacci, also, Pete Visclosky, and Chris Collins. As you just heard from Mr. Joyce, the Great Lakes are a huge issue. But, also, for us, Lake Erie is a huge issue. My legislation was put into this bill to require the EPA to appoint a coordinator to address the issue of harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes. We have so many groups that are interested, but we need the EPA to help coordinate. Our friends helped get this language into this bill, and I am deeply grateful for that. These harmful algal blooms affect over half a million Ohioans. It did in 2014. Lake Erie provides clean drinking water for approximately 3 million Ohioans, many of them up and around the Cleveland and Toledo areas. In August 2014, we had an environmental disaster caused by a harmful algal bloom that left nearly 500,000 residents of Toledo and the western basin without safe drinking water for 3 days. Lake Erie's tourist industry generates $12.9 billion in visitor spending, including 119,000 jobs, and contributes $1.7 billion in Federal, State, and local taxes. This crisis just continues to build, and it is critical that we start working together to come up with a plan to stem the growing tide. The Great Lakes' abundance of fresh water is a vital resource and a strategic advantage, and it is critical that we do everything in our power to combat the threats to the Great Lakes that threaten the health and well-being of Ohio and other States surrounding the Great Lakes. So we must do everything we can. This language helps to make that happen. This language will ensure that there is a coordinator at the EPA to work with the appropriate Federal, State, local, tribal, and foreign governments to address this critical issue affecting the State of Ohio. As we see the changes in our economy and as we see what is happening out west, we are reminded every single day how critical and how lucky we are, those of us who live in the Great Lakes region, to be able to access this fresh water. So, again, I thank my friends from Ohio. I thank Mr. Shuster from this committee, Mr. DeFazio, and others who helped make this happen and for including this language in the bill. Hon. Tim Ryan, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Congressman Ryan: We write in support of H.R. 1923, your bill requiring the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to appoint a Great Lakes Harmful Algal Bloom Coordinator, which is now part of H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2015. Thank you for your leadership and for being a champion for our Great Lakes, particularly Lake Erie. Currently there are many efforts underway to reduce the number of harmful algal blooms throughout the Great Lakes, such as in Lake Erie, Saginaw and Green Bays, and Fox River. These efforts, however, are not always coordinated to leverage resources and share vital information. Appointing a coordinator ensures resources are used effectively and efficiently and that federal, state, and local agencies, tribal governments, universities and non-governmental organizations are working collaboratively to reduce phosphorus flowing into the Great Lakes. The first step is a coordinator to ensure everyone is working together to address these complex issues. A coordinator could not come quickly enough. Lake Erie is the canary in the coal mine of what is to come for freshwater bodies if the nation does not solve this problem. In 2015, Lake Erie experienced a HAB that stretched from Michigan to well past Cleveland and was the biggest bloom on record. In 2014 and 2013, residents in the Toledo area and Carroll Township, respectively, went without tap water because of the toxins produced by these blooms. As you know, over 30 million people rely on the Great Lakes for their drinking water. We must take action now because the longer we wait, the more serious and expensive this problem becomes. Please let Kristy Meyer with the Ohio Environmental Council know how we can be helpful in seeing this vital piece of legislation become law.

[[Page H1957]] Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller), who has fought for years to protect the Great Lakes. Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the chairman for yielding the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my very, very, strong support for H.R. 223, which is the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016. {time} 1545 Actually, as the chairman has said, protecting and preserving the Great Lakes has always been a principal advocacy for myself in all the years that I have been in public service, way before I came to the Congress. I actually grew up on the Great Lakes. I still live on the Great Lakes. My family was in the marina business, so for us, the lakes were more than just a source of recreation, they put food on the table for my family. Like so many from the region, the Great Lakes are such a very proud, proud part of our heritage and of our identity. Our Great Lakes, as has been said, generate billions of dollars each and every year through the fishing and shipping industries and recreational activities. They account for 85 to 90 percent of this country's freshwater drinking supply and over 20 percent worldwide. There is actually more freshwater under the polar icecaps, but you cannot get at it. You can't get at it to drink it. You can get at the Great Lakes. That is why we are always wanting to protect the Great Lakes. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, we have not been the best stewards of these magnificent lakes, and we owe it, I think, to future generations to help assure that they are protected and that they are preserved as well. One of the ways to do that, I believe, is through continued funding and support of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. For years, the administration has proposed budgets that include cuts of millions of dollars to the GLRI, but it is Congress--this Congress-- that has always stepped in to recover this funding. That is just one of the reasons that I support this bill, because it does authorize funding at the essential levels--$300 million--for the next 5 years. Mr. Speaker, I will also join my colleagues in pointing out that this is truly a bipartisan effort, as you can tell from the people that are on the floor this morning talking about this. Most of us are from the Great Lakes, whether it is Ohio, Michigan, or some of the other Great Lakes States. But it is not just a regional jewel, just a regional treasure, the Great Lakes are a national treasure and deserve to be protected in that way. Mr. Speaker, over the years I have seen firsthand the impact that GLRI is having on our lakes, whether that is dredging, or beach and shoreline restoration, fighting invasive species, all of these projects are so critical. Just last fall I was delighted to be part of the unveiling of $20 million of GLRI grants for the Clinton River Restoration. The Clinton River, which flows through a major metropolitan area in southeast Michigan, is in desperate need of restoration. So this funding will go a long way in ensuring that the Clinton River is no longer an area of concern and has a thriving ecosystem and a watershed. Mr. Speaker, God gave us these magnificent, magnificent Great Lakes that have provided us with so much, but we need to be better stewards of them. Quite frankly, we have a lot of making up to do to Mother Nature--a lot of making up. I believe this bill goes a long way in bringing the necessary attention and the resources to a problem that we have long ago identified and need to address. Mr. Speaker, again, I strongly support H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act, and I urge all my colleagues to support it as well. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee). Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member, for yielding. I also want to thank the folks on both sides of the aisle for their great work on this Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, particularly my colleague from Michigan, Congresswoman Miller, who just spoke and who will be leaving Congress at the end of this year. She has been a defender of the Great Lakes for her entire time here. I think it is a fitting part of her legacy that this legislation, hopefully today, will pass this House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, being from Michigan and being a part of the Great Lakes, really growing up around the lakes and in the lakes gives us a lot of pride in my home State. It is the greatest freshwater source, surface freshwater source on the planet, and provides drinking water to over 30 million Americans. It is a great economic resource as well with great benefits to our entire Nation. It supports millions of jobs, and billions of income every year is derived from the dependence that we have on this great resource. It supports commerce, agriculture, transportation, and tourism. It is home to over 3,500 species of plants and animals. It is an incredible ecosystem. But we know that the threat to the lakes--the threats--multiple threats to the lakes--are real. From invasive species like Asian carp to toxic chemical contamination and to habitat loss, we have to do everything we can within our power to protect the Great Lakes and combat these really clear present threats. So I am really proud in a very bipartisan fashion to support full funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to protect and restore that which we have lost in the largest system of fresh water in the world. In the short time that the GLRI has been in place, we have made progress--and we know that this is an effective program--addressing longstanding environmental problems confronting the lakes. Over 2,500 individual projects have already been implemented to improve water quality, to clean up contaminated shorelines, to protect and restore native habitats and species, and to control invasive species. Mr. Speaker, we are here because we know we have to do more. I join my colleagues in urging Congress to join us in supporting the economic and environmental health of the Great Lakes and making this a permanent part of American law. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to make a couple of closing comments. We had some hearings in my subcommittee on this, and part of our oversight responsibility is to make sure that taxpayer dollars are being spent the way they should be. We requested a GAO--a government accountability--report, and I am pleased to announce that the report came back very favorable, that the monies to be invested to protect the Great Lakes is being spent the way it is intended to be. The only negative that was in the report--which is really minor--was the agencies, the EPA needed to do a better job working together and communicating, and they already had started that when they got the report. So I want to assure our fiscal hawks out there that this money is being spent the way it is intended by Congress, and we got that as part of our oversight duty. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I urge our support of H.R. 223 and to continue to protect and enhance the Great Lakes. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 223, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1954-H1957] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE ACT OF 2016 Mr. GIBBS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 223, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to bring up H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016, introduced by my Ohio colleague, Congressman Dave Joyce, on the floor today. The Great Lakes are an important resource for the United States. More than 30 million people live in the Great Lakes region, and the lakes help support over $200 billion a year in economic activity. The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force of Federal agencies was created in 2004 by executive order to help ensure coordination between the Federal, State, and private parties protecting and restoring the Great Lakes. In 2010, the task force released an action plan as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to accelerate efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes. Under the Initiative, the Environmental Protection Agency collaborates with other Federal partners, including the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, to select the best combination of projects and activities for Great Lakes protection and restoration. In September of 2014, the Federal agencies released an updated Action Plan II, which summarizes the actions that the Federal agencies plan to implement during fiscal years 2015 through 2019. The Action Plan aims to strategically target the biggest threats to the Great Lakes ecosystem and to accelerate progress toward long-term goals. H.R. 223 will formally authorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative for 5 years and modifies the program based on recommendations that the Committee received from stakeholders, hearings, and the GAO reports on EPA's activities during multiple years of oversight. The bill is a positive step forward for the Great Lakes region and the United States as a whole as we continue to prioritize protection and restoration of one of our Nation's most valuable resources. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016. This bill extends the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program which has had bipartisan support among the Great Lakes delegation for 5 years. I want to thank my colleagues, Representatives David Joyce, Dan Lipinski, and Rick Nolan, for their hard work and effort to extend the authorization of appropriations for this program through fiscal year 2021. These and other members of the Midwest delegation worked diligently to get this legislation to the floor for consideration. I want to thank them all for a job well done. It accelerates efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes, the largest system of surface freshwater in the world. Through unprecedented Federal agency coordination and the development of partnerships with the Great Lakes States and local communities, the initiative has already funded more than 2,000 projects to improve water quality, protect and restore native habitats, and prevent and control invasive species in the Great Lakes. Mr. Speaker, legislation similar to this bill was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. However, that authorization was only for 1 fiscal year. This legislation provides for a full 5-year reauthorization. That timeline is necessary to allow many longer term projects to be planned, capitalized, and completed. Further, this bill will allow States and local communities to coordinate their efforts to combat harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes for the first time. The harmful algal blooms that shut down the drinking water system in Toledo, Ohio, for 3 days in 2014 and that re-emerged in 2015 are still fresh in our memories. For this reason, I am pleased that this legislation includes the text of H.R. 1923, sponsored by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), to require EPA to appoint a Federal coordinator to work with the Federal agencies, the States, the tribes, and other stakeholders to address the recurring challenges of algal blooms in the Great Lakes. This coordinator will ensure that GLRI funds are utilized in the most efficient and effective way to reduce nutrients finding their way into the lakes. Lastly, this bill includes a savings clause to clarify that the GLRI authorization does not expand the regulatory authority of EPA related to restoration of the Great Lakes. I did not advocate for this provision. However, let's make it clear here today on the floor that this language should not be interpreted as preventing EPA or other Federal agencies from continuing to utilize their existing authorities to address ongoing water quality challenges facing the lakes. Accordingly, this bill should help ensure that the Federal departments are able to fund work using all the existing tools in the toolbox that cause harmful algal blooms and other pollution and prevent Asian carp from invading the lakes, which would be a disaster, and clean up areas of concern and other high-priority threats. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 223. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Ohio [[Page H1956]] (Mr. Joyce), who has been a strong advocate for the protection of the Great Lakes and a sponsor of the bill. Mr. JOYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016. First, I want to thank my good friend, Bob Gibbs of Ohio, for helping me to shepherd this legislation through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I also want to thank Chairman Shuster for lending a hand and providing guidance on this. Now, I know I may sound like a broken record, but one of the greatest natural resources and economic powerhouses we have in the United States and the world, for that matter, is the Great Lakes. I think the resource is incredibly important because, in the future, freshwater is going to be the new gold. And, if you believe that like I do, you understand why the Great Lakes are so important. Let me give you a few quick facts about this treasure. The Great Lakes contains one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water. The Great Lakes contain about 85 percent of the fresh surface water in North America. In the U.S., the Great Lakes account for 95 percent of the fresh surface water. That is a lot of fresh water. If you took the water and spread it evenly across the Continental United States, the Great Lakes would submerge our country under 9\1/2\ feet of water. These lakes provide more than 35 million people with their drinking water. These Great Lakes support more than 3,500 species of plants and animals. Studies have shown that more than 1\1/2\ million jobs are connected to the five lakes, and they generate $62 billion in wages. Now, I know I have uttered those facts around the Capitol like a broken record since I got here, as have others, but these are powerful in telling our story. An investment in protecting this national treasure is a small down payment in protecting the drinking water for millions of people. This legislation will continue to make sure that we look at these Great Lakes as a national treasure and coordinate our investment in protecting them. Please stand with me today in sending a message to protect and preserve our Great Lakes. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan). Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I also thank my colleagues from Ohio. This has been one of the true bipartisan issues that we have dealt with. So I would like to thank Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Joyce, Ms. Kaptur, Marcia Fudge, Jim Renacci, also, Pete Visclosky, and Chris Collins. As you just heard from Mr. Joyce, the Great Lakes are a huge issue. But, also, for us, Lake Erie is a huge issue. My legislation was put into this bill to require the EPA to appoint a coordinator to address the issue of harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes. We have so many groups that are interested, but we need the EPA to help coordinate. Our friends helped get this language into this bill, and I am deeply grateful for that. These harmful algal blooms affect over half a million Ohioans. It did in 2014. Lake Erie provides clean drinking water for approximately 3 million Ohioans, many of them up and around the Cleveland and Toledo areas. In August 2014, we had an environmental disaster caused by a harmful algal bloom that left nearly 500,000 residents of Toledo and the western basin without safe drinking water for 3 days. Lake Erie's tourist industry generates $12.9 billion in visitor spending, including 119,000 jobs, and contributes $1.7 billion in Federal, State, and local taxes. This crisis just continues to build, and it is critical that we start working together to come up with a plan to stem the growing tide. The Great Lakes' abundance of fresh water is a vital resource and a strategic advantage, and it is critical that we do everything in our power to combat the threats to the Great Lakes that threaten the health and well-being of Ohio and other States surrounding the Great Lakes. So we must do everything we can. This language helps to make that happen. This language will ensure that there is a coordinator at the EPA to work with the appropriate Federal, State, local, tribal, and foreign governments to address this critical issue affecting the State of Ohio. As we see the changes in our economy and as we see what is happening out west, we are reminded every single day how critical and how lucky we are, those of us who live in the Great Lakes region, to be able to access this fresh water. So, again, I thank my friends from Ohio. I thank Mr. Shuster from this committee, Mr. DeFazio, and others who helped make this happen and for including this language in the bill. Hon. Tim Ryan, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Congressman Ryan: We write in support of H.R. 1923, your bill requiring the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to appoint a Great Lakes Harmful Algal Bloom Coordinator, which is now part of H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2015. Thank you for your leadership and for being a champion for our Great Lakes, particularly Lake Erie. Currently there are many efforts underway to reduce the number of harmful algal blooms throughout the Great Lakes, such as in Lake Erie, Saginaw and Green Bays, and Fox River. These efforts, however, are not always coordinated to leverage resources and share vital information. Appointing a coordinator ensures resources are used effectively and efficiently and that federal, state, and local agencies, tribal governments, universities and non-governmental organizations are working collaboratively to reduce phosphorus flowing into the Great Lakes. The first step is a coordinator to ensure everyone is working together to address these complex issues. A coordinator could not come quickly enough. Lake Erie is the canary in the coal mine of what is to come for freshwater bodies if the nation does not solve this problem. In 2015, Lake Erie experienced a HAB that stretched from Michigan to well past Cleveland and was the biggest bloom on record. In 2014 and 2013, residents in the Toledo area and Carroll Township, respectively, went without tap water because of the toxins produced by these blooms. As you know, over 30 million people rely on the Great Lakes for their drinking water. We must take action now because the longer we wait, the more serious and expensive this problem becomes. Please let Kristy Meyer with the Ohio Environmental Council know how we can be helpful in seeing this vital piece of legislation become law.

[[Page H1957]] Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller), who has fought for years to protect the Great Lakes. Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the chairman for yielding the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my very, very, strong support for H.R. 223, which is the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016. {time} 1545 Actually, as the chairman has said, protecting and preserving the Great Lakes has always been a principal advocacy for myself in all the years that I have been in public service, way before I came to the Congress. I actually grew up on the Great Lakes. I still live on the Great Lakes. My family was in the marina business, so for us, the lakes were more than just a source of recreation, they put food on the table for my family. Like so many from the region, the Great Lakes are such a very proud, proud part of our heritage and of our identity. Our Great Lakes, as has been said, generate billions of dollars each and every year through the fishing and shipping industries and recreational activities. They account for 85 to 90 percent of this country's freshwater drinking supply and over 20 percent worldwide. There is actually more freshwater under the polar icecaps, but you cannot get at it. You can't get at it to drink it. You can get at the Great Lakes. That is why we are always wanting to protect the Great Lakes. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, we have not been the best stewards of these magnificent lakes, and we owe it, I think, to future generations to help assure that they are protected and that they are preserved as well. One of the ways to do that, I believe, is through continued funding and support of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. For years, the administration has proposed budgets that include cuts of millions of dollars to the GLRI, but it is Congress--this Congress-- that has always stepped in to recover this funding. That is just one of the reasons that I support this bill, because it does authorize funding at the essential levels--$300 million--for the next 5 years. Mr. Speaker, I will also join my colleagues in pointing out that this is truly a bipartisan effort, as you can tell from the people that are on the floor this morning talking about this. Most of us are from the Great Lakes, whether it is Ohio, Michigan, or some of the other Great Lakes States. But it is not just a regional jewel, just a regional treasure, the Great Lakes are a national treasure and deserve to be protected in that way. Mr. Speaker, over the years I have seen firsthand the impact that GLRI is having on our lakes, whether that is dredging, or beach and shoreline restoration, fighting invasive species, all of these projects are so critical. Just last fall I was delighted to be part of the unveiling of $20 million of GLRI grants for the Clinton River Restoration. The Clinton River, which flows through a major metropolitan area in southeast Michigan, is in desperate need of restoration. So this funding will go a long way in ensuring that the Clinton River is no longer an area of concern and has a thriving ecosystem and a watershed. Mr. Speaker, God gave us these magnificent, magnificent Great Lakes that have provided us with so much, but we need to be better stewards of them. Quite frankly, we have a lot of making up to do to Mother Nature--a lot of making up. I believe this bill goes a long way in bringing the necessary attention and the resources to a problem that we have long ago identified and need to address. Mr. Speaker, again, I strongly support H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act, and I urge all my colleagues to support it as well. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee). Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member, for yielding. I also want to thank the folks on both sides of the aisle for their great work on this Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, particularly my colleague from Michigan, Congresswoman Miller, who just spoke and who will be leaving Congress at the end of this year. She has been a defender of the Great Lakes for her entire time here. I think it is a fitting part of her legacy that this legislation, hopefully today, will pass this House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, being from Michigan and being a part of the Great Lakes, really growing up around the lakes and in the lakes gives us a lot of pride in my home State. It is the greatest freshwater source, surface freshwater source on the planet, and provides drinking water to over 30 million Americans. It is a great economic resource as well with great benefits to our entire Nation. It supports millions of jobs, and billions of income every year is derived from the dependence that we have on this great resource. It supports commerce, agriculture, transportation, and tourism. It is home to over 3,500 species of plants and animals. It is an incredible ecosystem. But we know that the threat to the lakes--the threats--multiple threats to the lakes--are real. From invasive species like Asian carp to toxic chemical contamination and to habitat loss, we have to do everything we can within our power to protect the Great Lakes and combat these really clear present threats. So I am really proud in a very bipartisan fashion to support full funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to protect and restore that which we have lost in the largest system of fresh water in the world. In the short time that the GLRI has been in place, we have made progress--and we know that this is an effective program--addressing longstanding environmental problems confronting the lakes. Over 2,500 individual projects have already been implemented to improve water quality, to clean up contaminated shorelines, to protect and restore native habitats and species, and to control invasive species. Mr. Speaker, we are here because we know we have to do more. I join my colleagues in urging Congress to join us in supporting the economic and environmental health of the Great Lakes and making this a permanent part of American law. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to make a couple of closing comments. We had some hearings in my subcommittee on this, and part of our oversight responsibility is to make sure that taxpayer dollars are being spent the way they should be. We requested a GAO--a government accountability--report, and I am pleased to announce that the report came back very favorable, that the monies to be invested to protect the Great Lakes is being spent the way it is intended to be. The only negative that was in the report--which is really minor--was the agencies, the EPA needed to do a better job working together and communicating, and they already had started that when they got the report. So I want to assure our fiscal hawks out there that this money is being spent the way it is intended by Congress, and we got that as part of our oversight duty. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I urge our support of H.R. 223 and to continue to protect and enhance the Great Lakes. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 223, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1954-H1957] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE ACT OF 2016 Mr. GIBBS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 223, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to bring up H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016, introduced by my Ohio colleague, Congressman Dave Joyce, on the floor today. The Great Lakes are an important resource for the United States. More than 30 million people live in the Great Lakes region, and the lakes help support over $200 billion a year in economic activity. The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force of Federal agencies was created in 2004 by executive order to help ensure coordination between the Federal, State, and private parties protecting and restoring the Great Lakes. In 2010, the task force released an action plan as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to accelerate efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes. Under the Initiative, the Environmental Protection Agency collaborates with other Federal partners, including the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, to select the best combination of projects and activities for Great Lakes protection and restoration. In September of 2014, the Federal agencies released an updated Action Plan II, which summarizes the actions that the Federal agencies plan to implement during fiscal years 2015 through 2019. The Action Plan aims to strategically target the biggest threats to the Great Lakes ecosystem and to accelerate progress toward long-term goals. H.R. 223 will formally authorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative for 5 years and modifies the program based on recommendations that the Committee received from stakeholders, hearings, and the GAO reports on EPA's activities during multiple years of oversight. The bill is a positive step forward for the Great Lakes region and the United States as a whole as we continue to prioritize protection and restoration of one of our Nation's most valuable resources. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016. This bill extends the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program which has had bipartisan support among the Great Lakes delegation for 5 years. I want to thank my colleagues, Representatives David Joyce, Dan Lipinski, and Rick Nolan, for their hard work and effort to extend the authorization of appropriations for this program through fiscal year 2021. These and other members of the Midwest delegation worked diligently to get this legislation to the floor for consideration. I want to thank them all for a job well done. It accelerates efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes, the largest system of surface freshwater in the world. Through unprecedented Federal agency coordination and the development of partnerships with the Great Lakes States and local communities, the initiative has already funded more than 2,000 projects to improve water quality, protect and restore native habitats, and prevent and control invasive species in the Great Lakes. Mr. Speaker, legislation similar to this bill was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. However, that authorization was only for 1 fiscal year. This legislation provides for a full 5-year reauthorization. That timeline is necessary to allow many longer term projects to be planned, capitalized, and completed. Further, this bill will allow States and local communities to coordinate their efforts to combat harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes for the first time. The harmful algal blooms that shut down the drinking water system in Toledo, Ohio, for 3 days in 2014 and that re-emerged in 2015 are still fresh in our memories. For this reason, I am pleased that this legislation includes the text of H.R. 1923, sponsored by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), to require EPA to appoint a Federal coordinator to work with the Federal agencies, the States, the tribes, and other stakeholders to address the recurring challenges of algal blooms in the Great Lakes. This coordinator will ensure that GLRI funds are utilized in the most efficient and effective way to reduce nutrients finding their way into the lakes. Lastly, this bill includes a savings clause to clarify that the GLRI authorization does not expand the regulatory authority of EPA related to restoration of the Great Lakes. I did not advocate for this provision. However, let's make it clear here today on the floor that this language should not be interpreted as preventing EPA or other Federal agencies from continuing to utilize their existing authorities to address ongoing water quality challenges facing the lakes. Accordingly, this bill should help ensure that the Federal departments are able to fund work using all the existing tools in the toolbox that cause harmful algal blooms and other pollution and prevent Asian carp from invading the lakes, which would be a disaster, and clean up areas of concern and other high-priority threats. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 223. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Ohio [[Page H1956]] (Mr. Joyce), who has been a strong advocate for the protection of the Great Lakes and a sponsor of the bill. Mr. JOYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016. First, I want to thank my good friend, Bob Gibbs of Ohio, for helping me to shepherd this legislation through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I also want to thank Chairman Shuster for lending a hand and providing guidance on this. Now, I know I may sound like a broken record, but one of the greatest natural resources and economic powerhouses we have in the United States and the world, for that matter, is the Great Lakes. I think the resource is incredibly important because, in the future, freshwater is going to be the new gold. And, if you believe that like I do, you understand why the Great Lakes are so important. Let me give you a few quick facts about this treasure. The Great Lakes contains one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water. The Great Lakes contain about 85 percent of the fresh surface water in North America. In the U.S., the Great Lakes account for 95 percent of the fresh surface water. That is a lot of fresh water. If you took the water and spread it evenly across the Continental United States, the Great Lakes would submerge our country under 9\1/2\ feet of water. These lakes provide more than 35 million people with their drinking water. These Great Lakes support more than 3,500 species of plants and animals. Studies have shown that more than 1\1/2\ million jobs are connected to the five lakes, and they generate $62 billion in wages. Now, I know I have uttered those facts around the Capitol like a broken record since I got here, as have others, but these are powerful in telling our story. An investment in protecting this national treasure is a small down payment in protecting the drinking water for millions of people. This legislation will continue to make sure that we look at these Great Lakes as a national treasure and coordinate our investment in protecting them. Please stand with me today in sending a message to protect and preserve our Great Lakes. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan). Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I also thank my colleagues from Ohio. This has been one of the true bipartisan issues that we have dealt with. So I would like to thank Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Joyce, Ms. Kaptur, Marcia Fudge, Jim Renacci, also, Pete Visclosky, and Chris Collins. As you just heard from Mr. Joyce, the Great Lakes are a huge issue. But, also, for us, Lake Erie is a huge issue. My legislation was put into this bill to require the EPA to appoint a coordinator to address the issue of harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes. We have so many groups that are interested, but we need the EPA to help coordinate. Our friends helped get this language into this bill, and I am deeply grateful for that. These harmful algal blooms affect over half a million Ohioans. It did in 2014. Lake Erie provides clean drinking water for approximately 3 million Ohioans, many of them up and around the Cleveland and Toledo areas. In August 2014, we had an environmental disaster caused by a harmful algal bloom that left nearly 500,000 residents of Toledo and the western basin without safe drinking water for 3 days. Lake Erie's tourist industry generates $12.9 billion in visitor spending, including 119,000 jobs, and contributes $1.7 billion in Federal, State, and local taxes. This crisis just continues to build, and it is critical that we start working together to come up with a plan to stem the growing tide. The Great Lakes' abundance of fresh water is a vital resource and a strategic advantage, and it is critical that we do everything in our power to combat the threats to the Great Lakes that threaten the health and well-being of Ohio and other States surrounding the Great Lakes. So we must do everything we can. This language helps to make that happen. This language will ensure that there is a coordinator at the EPA to work with the appropriate Federal, State, local, tribal, and foreign governments to address this critical issue affecting the State of Ohio. As we see the changes in our economy and as we see what is happening out west, we are reminded every single day how critical and how lucky we are, those of us who live in the Great Lakes region, to be able to access this fresh water. So, again, I thank my friends from Ohio. I thank Mr. Shuster from this committee, Mr. DeFazio, and others who helped make this happen and for including this language in the bill. Hon. Tim Ryan, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Congressman Ryan: We write in support of H.R. 1923, your bill requiring the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to appoint a Great Lakes Harmful Algal Bloom Coordinator, which is now part of H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2015. Thank you for your leadership and for being a champion for our Great Lakes, particularly Lake Erie. Currently there are many efforts underway to reduce the number of harmful algal blooms throughout the Great Lakes, such as in Lake Erie, Saginaw and Green Bays, and Fox River. These efforts, however, are not always coordinated to leverage resources and share vital information. Appointing a coordinator ensures resources are used effectively and efficiently and that federal, state, and local agencies, tribal governments, universities and non-governmental organizations are working collaboratively to reduce phosphorus flowing into the Great Lakes. The first step is a coordinator to ensure everyone is working together to address these complex issues. A coordinator could not come quickly enough. Lake Erie is the canary in the coal mine of what is to come for freshwater bodies if the nation does not solve this problem. In 2015, Lake Erie experienced a HAB that stretched from Michigan to well past Cleveland and was the biggest bloom on record. In 2014 and 2013, residents in the Toledo area and Carroll Township, respectively, went without tap water because of the toxins produced by these blooms. As you know, over 30 million people rely on the Great Lakes for their drinking water. We must take action now because the longer we wait, the more serious and expensive this problem becomes. Please let Kristy Meyer with the Ohio Environmental Council know how we can be helpful in seeing this vital piece of legislation become law.

[[Page H1957]] Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller), who has fought for years to protect the Great Lakes. Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the chairman for yielding the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my very, very, strong support for H.R. 223, which is the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016. {time} 1545 Actually, as the chairman has said, protecting and preserving the Great Lakes has always been a principal advocacy for myself in all the years that I have been in public service, way before I came to the Congress. I actually grew up on the Great Lakes. I still live on the Great Lakes. My family was in the marina business, so for us, the lakes were more than just a source of recreation, they put food on the table for my family. Like so many from the region, the Great Lakes are such a very proud, proud part of our heritage and of our identity. Our Great Lakes, as has been said, generate billions of dollars each and every year through the fishing and shipping industries and recreational activities. They account for 85 to 90 percent of this country's freshwater drinking supply and over 20 percent worldwide. There is actually more freshwater under the polar icecaps, but you cannot get at it. You can't get at it to drink it. You can get at the Great Lakes. That is why we are always wanting to protect the Great Lakes. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, we have not been the best stewards of these magnificent lakes, and we owe it, I think, to future generations to help assure that they are protected and that they are preserved as well. One of the ways to do that, I believe, is through continued funding and support of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. For years, the administration has proposed budgets that include cuts of millions of dollars to the GLRI, but it is Congress--this Congress-- that has always stepped in to recover this funding. That is just one of the reasons that I support this bill, because it does authorize funding at the essential levels--$300 million--for the next 5 years. Mr. Speaker, I will also join my colleagues in pointing out that this is truly a bipartisan effort, as you can tell from the people that are on the floor this morning talking about this. Most of us are from the Great Lakes, whether it is Ohio, Michigan, or some of the other Great Lakes States. But it is not just a regional jewel, just a regional treasure, the Great Lakes are a national treasure and deserve to be protected in that way. Mr. Speaker, over the years I have seen firsthand the impact that GLRI is having on our lakes, whether that is dredging, or beach and shoreline restoration, fighting invasive species, all of these projects are so critical. Just last fall I was delighted to be part of the unveiling of $20 million of GLRI grants for the Clinton River Restoration. The Clinton River, which flows through a major metropolitan area in southeast Michigan, is in desperate need of restoration. So this funding will go a long way in ensuring that the Clinton River is no longer an area of concern and has a thriving ecosystem and a watershed. Mr. Speaker, God gave us these magnificent, magnificent Great Lakes that have provided us with so much, but we need to be better stewards of them. Quite frankly, we have a lot of making up to do to Mother Nature--a lot of making up. I believe this bill goes a long way in bringing the necessary attention and the resources to a problem that we have long ago identified and need to address. Mr. Speaker, again, I strongly support H.R. 223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act, and I urge all my colleagues to support it as well. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee). Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member, for yielding. I also want to thank the folks on both sides of the aisle for their great work on this Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, particularly my colleague from Michigan, Congresswoman Miller, who just spoke and who will be leaving Congress at the end of this year. She has been a defender of the Great Lakes for her entire time here. I think it is a fitting part of her legacy that this legislation, hopefully today, will pass this House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, being from Michigan and being a part of the Great Lakes, really growing up around the lakes and in the lakes gives us a lot of pride in my home State. It is the greatest freshwater source, surface freshwater source on the planet, and provides drinking water to over 30 million Americans. It is a great economic resource as well with great benefits to our entire Nation. It supports millions of jobs, and billions of income every year is derived from the dependence that we have on this great resource. It supports commerce, agriculture, transportation, and tourism. It is home to over 3,500 species of plants and animals. It is an incredible ecosystem. But we know that the threat to the lakes--the threats--multiple threats to the lakes--are real. From invasive species like Asian carp to toxic chemical contamination and to habitat loss, we have to do everything we can within our power to protect the Great Lakes and combat these really clear present threats. So I am really proud in a very bipartisan fashion to support full funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to protect and restore that which we have lost in the largest system of fresh water in the world. In the short time that the GLRI has been in place, we have made progress--and we know that this is an effective program--addressing longstanding environmental problems confronting the lakes. Over 2,500 individual projects have already been implemented to improve water quality, to clean up contaminated shorelines, to protect and restore native habitats and species, and to control invasive species. Mr. Speaker, we are here because we know we have to do more. I join my colleagues in urging Congress to join us in supporting the economic and environmental health of the Great Lakes and making this a permanent part of American law. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to make a couple of closing comments. We had some hearings in my subcommittee on this, and part of our oversight responsibility is to make sure that taxpayer dollars are being spent the way they should be. We requested a GAO--a government accountability--report, and I am pleased to announce that the report came back very favorable, that the monies to be invested to protect the Great Lakes is being spent the way it is intended to be. The only negative that was in the report--which is really minor--was the agencies, the EPA needed to do a better job working together and communicating, and they already had started that when they got the report. So I want to assure our fiscal hawks out there that this money is being spent the way it is intended by Congress, and we got that as part of our oversight duty. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I urge our support of H.R. 223 and to continue to protect and enhance the Great Lakes. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 223, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,30165,30165,30233,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [house] [pages

(mr. gibbs) and the gentleman from oregon (mr. defazio) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from ohio. general leave mr. gibbs. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on h.r. 223, as amended. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from ohio? there was no objection. mr. gibbs. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i appreciate the opportunity to bring up h.r. 223, the great lakes restoration initiative act of 2016, introduced by my ohio colleague, congressman dave joyce, on the floor today. the great lakes are an important resource for the united states. more than 30 million people live in the great lakes region, and the lakes help support over $200 billion a year in economic activity. the great lakes interagency task force of federal agencies was created in 2004 by executive order to help ensure coordination between the federal, state, and private parties protecting and restoring the great lakes. in 2010, the task force released an action plan as part of the great lakes restoration initiative to accelerate efforts to protect and restore the great lakes. under the initiative, the environmental protection agency collaborates with other federal partners, including the great lakes interagency task force, to select the best combination of projects and activities for great lakes protection and restoration. in september of 2014, the federal agencies released an updated action plan ii, which summarizes the actions that the federal agencies plan to implement during fiscal years 2015 through 2019. the action plan aims to strategically target the biggest threats to the great lakes ecosystem and to accelerate progress toward long-term goals. h.r. 223 will formally authorize the great lakes restoration initiative for 5 years and modifies the program based on recommendations that the committee received from stakeholders, hearings, and the gao reports on epa's activities during multiple years of oversight. the bill is a positive step forward for the great lakes region and the united states as a whole as we continue to prioritize protection and restoration of one of our nation's most valuable resources. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 223, the great lakes restoration initiative act of 2016. this bill extends the great lakes restoration initiative, a program which has had bipartisan support among the great lakes delegation for 5 years. i want to thank my colleagues, representatives david joyce, dan lipinski, and rick nolan, for their hard work and effort to extend the authorization of appropriations for this program through fiscal year 2021. these and other members of the midwest delegation worked diligently to get this legislation to the floor for consideration. i want to thank them all for a job well done. it accelerates efforts to protect and restore the great lakes, the largest system of surface freshwater in the world. through unprecedented federal agency coordination and the development of partnerships with the great lakes states and local communities, the initiative has already funded more than 2,000 projects to improve water quality, protect and restore native habitats, and prevent and control invasive species in the great lakes. mr. speaker, legislation similar to this bill was included in the consolidated appropriations act of 2016. however, that authorization was only for 1 fiscal year. this legislation provides for a full 5-year reauthorization. that timeline is necessary to allow many longer term projects to be planned, capitalized, and completed. further, this bill will allow states and local communities to coordinate their efforts to combat harmful algal blooms in the great lakes for the first time. the harmful algal blooms that shut down the drinking water system in toledo, ohio, for 3 days in 2014 and that re-emerged in 2015 are still fresh in our memories. for this reason, i am pleased that this legislation includes the text of h.r. 1923, sponsored by the gentleman from ohio (mr. ryan), to require epa to appoint a federal coordinator to work with the federal agencies, the states, the tribes, and other stakeholders to address the recurring challenges of algal blooms in the great lakes. this coordinator will ensure that

reserve the balance of my time. mr. gibbs. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to my colleague from ohio [[page h1956]] (mr. joyce), who has been a strong advocate for the protection of the great lakes and a sponsor of the bill. mr. joyce. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 223, the great lakes restoration initiative act of 2016. first, i want to thank my good friend, bob gibbs of ohio, for helping me to shepherd this legislation through the transportation and infrastructure committee. i also want to thank chairman shuster for lending a hand and providing guidance on this. now, i know i may sound like a broken record, but one of the greatest natural resources and economic powerhouses we have in the united states and the world, for that matter, is the great lakes. i think the resource is incredibly important because, in the future, freshwater is going to be the new gold. and, if you believe that like i do, you understand why the great lakes are so important. let me give you a few quick facts about this treasure. the great lakes contains one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water. the great lakes contain about 85 percent of the fresh surface water in north america. in the u.s., the great lakes account for 95 percent of the fresh surface water. that is a lot of fresh water. if you took the water and spread it evenly across the continental united states, the great lakes would submerge our country under 9\1/2\ feet of water. these lakes provide more than 35 million people with their drinking water. these great lakes support more than 3,500 species of plants and animals. studies have shown that more than 1\1/2\ million jobs are connected to the five lakes, and they generate $62 billion in wages. now, i know i have uttered those facts around the capitol like a broken record since i got here, as have others, but these are powerful in telling our story. an investment in protecting this national treasure is a small down payment in protecting the drinking water for millions of people. this legislation will continue to make sure that we look at these great lakes as a national treasure and coordinate our investment in protecting them. please stand with me today in sending a message to protect and preserve our great lakes. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from ohio (mr. ryan). mr. ryan of ohio. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman, and i also thank my colleagues from ohio. this has been one of the true bipartisan issues that we have dealt with. so i would like to thank mr. gibbs, mr. joyce, ms. kaptur, marcia fudge, jim renacci, also, pete visclosky, and chris collins. as you just heard from mr. joyce, the great lakes are a huge issue. but, also, for us, lake erie is a huge issue. my legislation was put into this bill to require the epa to appoint a coordinator to address the issue of harmful algal blooms in the great lakes. we have so many groups that are interested, but we need the epa to help coordinate. our friends helped get this language into this bill, and i am deeply grateful for that. these harmful algal blooms affect over half a million ohioans. it did in 2014. lake erie provides clean drinking water for approximately 3 million ohioans, many of them up and around the cleveland and toledo areas. in august 2014, we had an environmental disaster caused by a harmful algal bloom that left nearly 500,000 residents of toledo and the western basin without safe drinking water for 3 days. lake erie's tourist industry generates $12.9 billion in visitor spending, including 119,000 jobs, and contributes $1.7 billion in federal, state, and local taxes. this crisis just continues to build, and it is critical that we start working together to come up with a plan to stem the growing tide. the great lakes' abundance of fresh water is a vital resource and a strategic advantage, and it is critical that we do everything in our power to combat the threats to the great lakes that threaten the health and well-being of ohio and other states surrounding the great lakes. so we must do everything we can. this language helps to make that happen. this language will ensure that there is a coordinator at the epa to work with the appropriate federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign governments to address this critical issue affecting the state of ohio. as we see the changes in our economy and as we see what is happening out west, we are reminded every single day how critical and how lucky we are, those of us who live in the great lakes region, to be able to access this fresh water. so, again, i thank my friends from ohio. i thank mr. shuster from this committee, mr. defazio, and others who helped make this happen and for including this language in the bill. hon. tim ryan, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear congressman ryan: we write in support of h.r. 1923, your bill requiring the administrator of the u.s. environmental protection agency to appoint a great lakes harmful algal bloom coordinator, which is now part of h.r. 223, the great lakes restoration initiative act of 2015. thank you for your leadership and for being a champion for our great lakes, particularly lake erie. currently there are many efforts underway to reduce the number of harmful algal blooms throughout the great lakes, such as in lake erie, saginaw and green bays, and fox river. these efforts, however, are not always coordinated to leverage resources and share vital information. appointing a coordinator ensures resources are used effectively and efficiently and that federal, state, and local agencies, tribal governments, universities and non-governmental organizations are working collaboratively to reduce phosphorus flowing into the great lakes. the first step is a coordinator to ensure everyone is working together to address these complex issues. a coordinator could not come quickly enough. lake erie is the canary in the coal mine of what is to come for freshwater bodies if the nation does not solve this problem. in 2015, lake erie experienced a hab that stretched from michigan to well past cleveland and was the biggest bloom on record. in 2014 and 2013, residents in the toledo area and carroll township, respectively, went without tap water because of the toxins produced by these blooms. as you know, over 30 million people rely on the great lakes for their drinking water. we must take action now because the longer we wait, the more serious and expensive this problem becomes. please let kristy meyer with the ohio environmental council know how we can be helpful in seeing this vital piece of legislation become law. sincerely, heather taylor-miesle, executive director, ohio environmental council; jill ryan, executive director,

[[page h1957]] mr. gibbs. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from michigan (mrs. miller), who has fought for years to protect the great lakes. mrs. miller of michigan. i thank the chairman for yielding the time. mr. speaker, i rise today to express my very, very, strong support for h.r. 223, which is the great lakes restoration initiative act of 2016. {time} 1545 actually, as the chairman has said, protecting and preserving the great lakes has always been a principal advocacy for myself in all the years that i have been in public service, way before i came to the congress. i actually grew up on the great lakes. i still live on the great lakes. my family was in the marina business, so for us, the lakes were more than just a source of recreation, they put food on the table for my family. like so many from the region, the great lakes are such a very proud, proud part of our heritage and of our identity. our great lakes, as has been said, generate billions of dollars each and every year through the fishing and shipping industries and recreational activities. they account for 85 to 90 percent of this country's freshwater drinking supply and over 20 percent worldwide. there is actually more freshwater under the polar icecaps, but you cannot get at it. you can't get at it to drink it. you can get at the great lakes. that is why we are always wanting to protect the great lakes. mr. speaker, unfortunately, we have not been the best stewards of these magnificent lakes, and we owe it, i think, to future generations to help assure that they are protected and that they are preserved as well. one of the ways to do that, i believe, is through continued funding and support of the great lakes restoration initiative. for years, the administration has proposed budgets that include cuts of millions of dollars to the glri, but it is congress--this congress-- that has always stepped in to recover this funding. that is just one of the reasons that i support this bill, because it does authorize funding at the essential levels--$300 million--for the next 5 years. mr. speaker, i will also join my colleagues in pointing out that this is truly a bipartisan effort, as you can tell from the people that are on the floor this morning talking about this. most of us are from the great lakes, whether it is ohio, michigan, or some of the other great lakes states. but it is not just a regional jewel, just a regional treasure, the great lakes are a national treasure and deserve to be protected in that way. mr. speaker, over the years i have seen firsthand the impact that glri is having on our lakes, whether that is dredging, or beach and shoreline restoration, fighting invasive species, all of these projects are so critical. just last fall i was delighted to be part of the unveiling of $20 million of glri grants for the clinton river restoration. the clinton river, which flows through a major metropolitan area in southeast michigan, is in desperate need of restoration. so this funding will go a long way in ensuring that the clinton river is no longer an area of concern and has a thriving ecosystem and a watershed. mr. speaker, god gave us these magnificent, magnificent great lakes that have provided us with so much, but we need to be better stewards of them. quite frankly, we have a lot of making up to do to mother nature--a lot of making up. i believe this bill goes a long way in bringing the necessary attention and the resources to a problem that we have long ago identified and need to address. mr. speaker, again, i strongly support h.r. 223, the great lakes restoration initiative act, and i urge all my colleagues to support it as well. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. kildee). mr. kildee. mr. speaker, i thank my friend, the ranking member, for yielding. i also want to thank the folks on both sides of the aisle for their great work on this great lakes restoration initiative, particularly my colleague from michigan, congresswoman miller, who just spoke and who will be leaving congress at the end of this year. she has been a defender of the great lakes for her entire time here. i think it is a fitting part of her legacy that this legislation, hopefully today, will pass this house of representatives. mr. speaker, being from michigan and being a part of the great lakes, really growing up around the lakes and in the lakes gives us a lot of pride in my home state. it is the greatest freshwater source, surface freshwater source on the planet, and provides drinking water to over 30 million americans. it is a great economic resource as well with great benefits to our entire nation. it supports millions of jobs, and billions of income every year is derived from the dependence that we have on this great resource. it supports commerce, agriculture, transportation, and tourism. it is home to over 3,500 species of plants and animals. it is an incredible ecosystem. but we know that the threat to the lakes--the threats--multiple threats to the lakes--are real. from invasive species like asian carp to toxic chemical contamination and to habitat loss, we have to do everything we can within our power to protect the great lakes and combat these really clear present threats. so i am really proud in a very bipartisan fashion to support full funding for the great lakes restoration initiative to protect and restore that which we have lost in the largest system of fresh water in the world. in the short time that the glri has been in place, we have made progress--and we know that this is an effective program--addressing longstanding environmental problems confronting the lakes. over 2,500 individual projects have already been implemented to improve water quality, to clean up contaminated shorelines, to protect and restore native habitats and species, and to control invasive species. mr. speaker, we are here because we know we have to do more. i join my colleagues in urging congress to join us in supporting the economic and environmental health of the great lakes and making this a permanent part of american law. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. gibbs. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i would just like to make a couple of closing comments. we had some hearings in my subcommittee on this, and part of our oversight responsibility is to make sure that taxpayer dollars are being spent the way they should be. we requested a gao--a government accountability--report, and i am pleased to announce that the report came back very favorable, that the monies to be invested to protect the great lakes is being spent the way it is intended to be. the only negative that was in the report--which is really minor--was the agencies, the epa needed to do a better job working together and communicating, and they already had started that when they got the report. so i want to assure our fiscal hawks out there that this money is being spent the way it is intended by congress, and we got that as part of our oversight duty. mr. speaker, in conclusion, i urge our support of h.r. 223 and to continue to protect and enhance the great lakes. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from ohio (mr. gibbs) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 223, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",30165
CREC-2016-04-26-pt1-PgH1957,CREC-2016-04-26,114,AMENDING THE FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT TO REAUTHORIZE THE NATIONAL ESTUARY PROGRAM,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1957-H1959] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMENDING THE FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT TO REAUTHORIZE THE NATIONAL ESTUARY PROGRAM Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1523) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to reauthorize the National Estuary Program, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 1523 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, [[Page H1958]] SECTION 1. COMPETITIVE AWARDS. Section 320(g) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1330(g)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(4) Competitive awards.-- ``(A) In general.--Using the amounts made available under subsection (i)(2)(B), the Administrator shall make competitive awards under this paragraph. ``(B) Application for awards.--The Administrator shall solicit applications for awards under this paragraph from State, interstate, and regional water pollution control agencies and entities, State coastal zone management agencies, interstate agencies, other public or nonprofit private agencies, institutions, organizations, and individuals. ``(C) Selection of recipients.--In selecting award recipients under this paragraph, the Administrator shall select recipients that are best able to address urgent and challenging issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal areas. Such issues shall include-- ``(i) extensive seagrass habitat losses resulting in significant impacts on fisheries and water quality; ``(ii) recurring harmful algae blooms; ``(iii) unusual marine mammal mortalities; ``(iv) invasive exotic species that may threaten wastewater systems and cause other damage; ``(v) jellyfish proliferation limiting community access to water during peak tourism seasons; ``(vi) flooding that may be related to sea level rise or wetland degradation or loss; and ``(vii) low dissolved oxygen conditions in estuarine waters and related nutrient management.''. SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Section 320 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1330) is amended by striking subsection (i) and inserting the following: ``(i) Authorization of Appropriations.-- ``(1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated to the Administrator $26,500,000 for each of fiscal years 2017 through 2021 for-- ``(A) expenses relating to the administration of grants or awards by the Administrator under this section, including the award and oversight of grants and awards, except that such expenses may not exceed 5 percent of the amount appropriated under this subsection for a fiscal year; and ``(B) making grants and awards under subsection (g). ``(2) Allocations.-- ``(A) Conservation and management plans.--Not less than 80 percent of the amount made available under this subsection for a fiscal year shall be used by the Administrator to provide grant assistance for the development, implementation, and monitoring of each of the conservation and management plans eligible for grant assistance under subsection (g)(2). ``(B) Competitive awards.--Not less than 15 percent of the amount made available under this subsection for a fiscal year shall be used by the Administrator for making competitive awards described in subsection (g)(4).''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 1523. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today we are here to reauthorize the National Estuary Program found in section 320 of the Clean Water Act. Last June, here in the House, we passed Mr. LoBiondo's H.R. 944, and today we are passing S. 1523, which was introduced by Senator Whitehouse. Estuaries are unique and highly productive waters that are important to the ecological and economic bases of our Nation. Congress first authorized the National Estuary Program in the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act to promote the protection of nationally significant estuaries in the United States that are deemed to be threatened by pollution, development, or overuse. Unlike many of the programs under the Clean Water Act, the National Estuary Program is a nonregulatory program. Instead, it is designed to support the collaborative, voluntary efforts of Federal, State, and local stakeholders to restore degraded estuaries. Using consensus building and a collaborative decisionmaking process instead of a top-down driven regulatory approach, the National Estuary Program has been effective at promoting locally based involvement. In addition, NEP leverages non-Federal money for restoration activities by providing funding for the program. In reauthorizing the National Estuary Program, S. 1523 makes prudent fiscal adjustments. The amendment to S. 1523 strikes the text of the Senate bill and instead uses the legislative text of the House-passed bill, H.R. 944. An agreement was reached to split the difference in authorized appropriations levels of the two bills. As amended, the bill reauthorizes section 320 of the Clean Water Act through 2021, at an amount of $26.5 million a year. This amount is consistent with appropriations over the past 5 years and in recognition of the fiscal realities of today. S. 1523 also directs more funds to where they need to be, the individual estuaries in the program. The bill achieves this by reducing the amount of discretionary funds made available to the EPA. Finally, the bill allocates a portion of the eligible program funds for competitive awards to Federal, State, and local stakeholders to address certain high-priority estuary needs, including algal blooms, hypoxia, flooding, and invasive species. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of S. 1523. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the House is again considering legislation to reauthorize EPA's National Estuary Program. Last summer the House approved by voice vote a similar bill championed by my colleagues, the gentlemen from Washington (Mr. Larsen) and Florida (Mr. Murphy). I thank them for their hard work and dedication to produce this important piece of legislation. Estuaries are integral to the health and vibrancy of our national economy and environment. They are formed, as we all know, when fresh water drained from land mixes with salty seawater, and they serve as a nesting and feeding grounds for many plants and animals that form the basis of the aquatic food chain. Estuaries also help to maintain healthy ocean and coastal environments by filtering out sediments and pollutants that flow through our rivers and streams before they reach the ocean. Moreover, during storm and flood events, estuaries help defend our shores by softening the blow of storm surge. More than one-half of our population lives in coastal areas, and countless Americans depend on estuaries for storm and flood protection, and for the cultivation of their livelihoods. Estuarine habitats provide for millions of jobs in our country and contribute trillions to our national economy every year. These jobs are created by commercial and recreational fishing and boating, as well as tourism and other forms of recreation taking place just off our shores. As one of my colleagues noted during previous consideration of this legislation, restoring our estuaries can create more than 30 jobs for every $1 million invested. Regrettably, before we understood--fully understood--the extraordinary and irreplaceable value of estuaries, numerous activities were undertaken that have led to the decline in the health of our estuaries, leaving these coastal areas of our country vulnerable to pollution and more frequent and severe storm events. It is also undeniable that the population growth near estuaries has led to increased storm water runoff and sewage discharges fed into these fragile environments. Simply put, estuaries are too ecologically important to leave their fate to chance. With that in mind, today we consider S. 1523, desperately needed legislation that will reauthorize EPA's National Estuary Program. Since 1987, the National Estuary Program has operated at EPA in partnership with State and local partners and has developed innovative solutions to local water quality problems in estuarine environments. This nonregulatory program currently works to improve the health of 28 estuaries across the country, including three estuaries in Northwest: Puget Sound, Tillamook, and Columbia River estuaries. These estuaries are of great support to my home State, Oregon, and our regional and national economies. [[Page H1959]] Restoring and protecting these areas should be one of our highest concerns. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill would ensure that logical organizations across the country in partnership with the EPA can protect and restore estuaries for the benefit of future generations. I support passage of this legislation and hope that this is the last time this House must act to send this important bill to the President. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 1523. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), who is a sponsor of the bill and has worked tirelessly to protect estuaries throughout the Nation. {time} 1600 Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank Chairman Shuster, Chairman Gibbs, Ranking Members DeFazio and Napolitano, as well as my colleagues Mr. Larsen, Mr. Posey, and Mr. Murphy of Florida for helping to draft this legislation and reauthorization. We all share the hope that this is the last go-around to get this done. Estuaries across the country, including the Delaware Bay and Barnegat Bay estuaries in my district, have immeasurable economic, ecological, and environmental benefit. They deserve continued congressional support. This version of the National Estuary Program reauthorization is a bipartisan, fiscally responsible compromise with the Senate that reduces the authorization by $8.5 million. The important part is it ultimately increases the amount of money each estuary program will receive. Unlike many programs under the Clean Water Act, the National Estuary Program is a nonregulatory program, uniquely designed to support the collaborative, voluntary efforts of Federal, State, and local stakeholders to restore degraded estuaries. Unfortunately, the NEPs have been losing money due to increasing EPA administrative costs. We have heard that before, but, in this particular case, it is really hurting. To correct that, our legislation details precisely how the EPA is to spend the authorized and appropriated money. By setting limits of 5 percent for the EPA's administrative costs, we can guarantee 80 percent of the funding goes directly to the needs of the estuary and not bureaucratic salary and red tape. Also, in this year's reauthorization, we have set aside 15 percent of the funding for a competitive award program. This program seeks applications to deal with urgent and challenging issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal areas. By structuring how the money is spent and lowering authorization levels, this legislation strikes the right balance of fiscal and environmental responsibility. I want to thank my colleagues once again for their strong support of this, and I urge all Members to support the bill. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important legislation to protect estuaries throughout the country. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1523, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank Chairman Shuster, Chairman Gibbs, Ranking Members DeFazio and Napolitano, as well as my colleagues Mr. Larsen, Mr. Posey, and Mr. Murphy of Florida for helping to draft this legislation and reauthorization. We all share the hope that this is the last go-around to get this done. Estuaries across the country, including the Delaware Bay and Barnegat Bay estuaries in my district, have immeasurable economic, ecological, and environmental benefit. They deserve continued congressional support. This version of the National Estuary Program reauthorization is a bipartisan, fiscally responsible compromise with the Senate that reduces the authorization by $8.5 million. The important part is it ultimately increases the amount of money each estuary program will receive. Unlike many programs under the Clean Water Act, the National Estuary Program is a nonregulatory program, uniquely designed to support the collaborative, voluntary efforts of Federal, State, and local stakeholders to restore degraded estuaries. Unfortunately, the NEPs have been losing money due to increasing EPA administrative costs. We have heard that before, but, in this particular case, it is really hurting. To correct that, our legislation details precisely how the EPA is to spend the authorized and appropriated money. By setting limits of 5 percent for the EPA's administrative costs, we can guarantee 80 percent of the funding goes directly to the needs of the estuary and not bureaucratic salary and red tape. Also, in this year's reauthorization, we have set aside 15 percent of the funding for a competitive award program. This program seeks applications to deal with urgent and challenging issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal areas. By structuring how the money is spent and lowering authorization levels, this legislation strikes the right balance of fiscal and environmental responsibility. I want to thank my colleagues once again for their strong support of this, and I urge all Members to support the bill. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important legislation to protect estuaries throughout the country. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1523, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1957-H1959] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMENDING THE FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT TO REAUTHORIZE THE NATIONAL ESTUARY PROGRAM Mr. GIBBS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 1523. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today we are here to reauthorize the National Estuary Program found in section 320 of the Clean Water Act. Last June, here in the House, we passed Mr. LoBiondo's H.R. 944, and today we are passing S. 1523, which was introduced by Senator Whitehouse. Estuaries are unique and highly productive waters that are important to the ecological and economic bases of our Nation. Congress first authorized the National Estuary Program in the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act to promote the protection of nationally significant estuaries in the United States that are deemed to be threatened by pollution, development, or overuse. Unlike many of the programs under the Clean Water Act, the National Estuary Program is a nonregulatory program. Instead, it is designed to support the collaborative, voluntary efforts of Federal, State, and local stakeholders to restore degraded estuaries. Using consensus building and a collaborative decisionmaking process instead of a top-down driven regulatory approach, the National Estuary Program has been effective at promoting locally based involvement. In addition, NEP leverages non-Federal money for restoration activities by providing funding for the program. In reauthorizing the National Estuary Program, S. 1523 makes prudent fiscal adjustments. The amendment to S. 1523 strikes the text of the Senate bill and instead uses the legislative text of the House-passed bill, H.R. 944. An agreement was reached to split the difference in authorized appropriations levels of the two bills. As amended, the bill reauthorizes section 320 of the Clean Water Act through 2021, at an amount of $26.5 million a year. This amount is consistent with appropriations over the past 5 years and in recognition of the fiscal realities of today. S. 1523 also directs more funds to where they need to be, the individual estuaries in the program. The bill achieves this by reducing the amount of discretionary funds made available to the EPA. Finally, the bill allocates a portion of the eligible program funds for competitive awards to Federal, State, and local stakeholders to address certain high-priority estuary needs, including algal blooms, hypoxia, flooding, and invasive species. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of S. 1523. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the House is again considering legislation to reauthorize EPA's National Estuary Program. Last summer the House approved by voice vote a similar bill championed by my colleagues, the gentlemen from Washington (Mr. Larsen) and Florida (Mr. Murphy). I thank them for their hard work and dedication to produce this important piece of legislation. Estuaries are integral to the health and vibrancy of our national economy and environment. They are formed, as we all know, when fresh water drained from land mixes with salty seawater, and they serve as a nesting and feeding grounds for many plants and animals that form the basis of the aquatic food chain. Estuaries also help to maintain healthy ocean and coastal environments by filtering out sediments and pollutants that flow through our rivers and streams before they reach the ocean. Moreover, during storm and flood events, estuaries help defend our shores by softening the blow of storm surge. More than one-half of our population lives in coastal areas, and countless Americans depend on estuaries for storm and flood protection, and for the cultivation of their livelihoods. Estuarine habitats provide for millions of jobs in our country and contribute trillions to our national economy every year. These jobs are created by commercial and recreational fishing and boating, as well as tourism and other forms of recreation taking place just off our shores. As one of my colleagues noted during previous consideration of this legislation, restoring our estuaries can create more than 30 jobs for every $1 million invested. Regrettably, before we understood--fully understood--the extraordinary and irreplaceable value of estuaries, numerous activities were undertaken that have led to the decline in the health of our estuaries, leaving these coastal areas of our country vulnerable to pollution and more frequent and severe storm events. It is also undeniable that the population growth near estuaries has led to increased storm water runoff and sewage discharges fed into these fragile environments. Simply put, estuaries are too ecologically important to leave their fate to chance. With that in mind, today we consider S. 1523, desperately needed legislation that will reauthorize EPA's National Estuary Program. Since 1987, the National Estuary Program has operated at EPA in partnership with State and local partners and has developed innovative solutions to local water quality problems in estuarine environments. This nonregulatory program currently works to improve the health of 28 estuaries across the country, including three estuaries in Northwest: Puget Sound, Tillamook, and Columbia River estuaries. These estuaries are of great support to my home State, Oregon, and our regional and national economies. [[Page H1959]] Restoring and protecting these areas should be one of our highest concerns. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill would ensure that logical organizations across the country in partnership with the EPA can protect and restore estuaries for the benefit of future generations. I support passage of this legislation and hope that this is the last time this House must act to send this important bill to the President. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 1523. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1684) to amend the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to impose penalties and provide for the recovery of removal costs and damages in connection with certain discharges of oil from foreign offshore units, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1684 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Spill Protection Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. LIABILITY OF OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF FOREIGN FACILITIES.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1684. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, following the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska in 1989, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA. The basic premise of OPA is that the party responsible for the spill is responsible for all of the costs of cleaning up the mess. The Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010 reminded us of the impact a spill of its size can have on waters, coastlines, people, and our economy. It is important to note that these offshore facilities, as defined by OPA, are limited only to the navigable waters of the United States, and foreign rigs cannot be designated as responsible parties. Therefore, if there were an oil spill originating in foreign waters, the most the responsible party would have to pay to clean up American waters and shores is $150 million. This issue is of particular concern to Gulf States. Mexico, Cuba, and the Bahamas are actively looking at expanding their offshore drilling operations. Of particular concern is Mexico, which is looking into ultradeep wells, exceeding 6,000 feet in depth. In 2012, Mexico's top oil regulators said they were not prepared to handle a serious accident or major oil spill. But it is not just the Gulf States that could be negatively affected by a spill. On the Canadian side of Lake Erie, offshore energy exploration is being conducted for natural gas. While Canadian law prohibits oil extraction from the Great Lakes, the risk of a spill persists. Again, under current law, the responsible party would only have to pay a maximum of $150 million for cleanup. In response to these concerns, my friend from Florida, Representative [[Page H1960]] Patrick Murphy, and I introduced the legislation that is being considered here today. The bill ensures that the responsible party, regardless of origin, pays for all American cleanup costs by applying OPA. This will also apply Clean Water Act penalties to the responsible foreign party. I am proud that this legislation has broad bipartisan support and has been endorsed by environmental fishing and other groups that depend on the water for their livelihoods. Our coastal communities need peace of mind that if they are harmed by a foreign spill, resources are available to clean up their shores and help them recover. American taxpayers should not have to foot the bill to bail out the mistakes of foreign companies. I would like to thank and commend the Coast Guard and the majority and minority staffs of the committee, particularly John Rayfield and Dave Jansen, for their work on this important legislation. H.R. 1684 is a very straightforward bill that looks to hold the party responsible for a foreign oil spill that affects U.S. waters or lands accountable. I urge all Members to support it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this noncontroversial legislation that will clarify existing Federal authority regarding the liability for and enforcement of offshore oil spills originating from a foreign source outside the U.S. exclusive economic zone. H.R. 1684, the Foreign Spill Protection Act of 2016, clarifies that owners and operators of oil production facilities located offshore and outside the United States are liable for cleanup costs and damages from oil spills. These foreign entities are responsible for oil spills that originate outside U.S. waters if they threaten or cause damage in the United States. The foreign entities would be subject to criminal and civil penalties, Federal removal authority, and any State-authorized remedy currently allowed under Federal and State law. I would like to commend the cooperation shown by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Shuster, Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee Chairman Hunter, and Ranking Member Garamendi in working out the final details of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, the Deepwater Horizon disaster painfully reminded us of how catastrophic an offshore oil spill can be, both in its geographic reach and in its environmental and economic costs. The settled liability and enforcement regimes authorized under the Oil Pollution Act and the Clean Water Act have proven themselves to be comprehensive, durable, and effective. In the event of a spill, this response regime has ensured time and time again that the Federal Government has clear, unequivocal authority to respond to a spill, restore the environment and communities harmed, and recover damages for the harm caused. This legislation will in no way impede or change those indispensable authorities. In closing, it is a helpful enhancement to clarify that spills originating from foreign sources fall under this well-established legal regime. I ask Members on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to thank the ranking member, Mr. DeFazio, for his statement and for his cooperation on this legislation. I also want to thank Chairman Shuster. As the gentleman mentioned, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is oftentimes an example of how we can put politics aside to work together and do good things for the American people. This legislation is very important to my constituents in south Florida, in the Florida Keys, and, really, to coastal communities all over the country. So I thank the gentleman for his statement. I thank everyone who had a part in crafting this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Murphy), who is vitally interested and concerned about this legislation. Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida and I thank the gentleman from Oregon for their tireless efforts to protect our environment. As the gentleman from Florida and I know firsthand, so much of our economy is based on our environment. Making sure that we have clean water and clean air is exactly what we need to be focused on. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, ensuring the party responsible for such oil spills is held liable. Hopefully, we get bipartisan support going forward. I thank the two gentlemen for their work putting this forward. I would also like to rise today in support of H.R. 2901, the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act. I was proud to put this bipartisan legislation forward with my good friend, another gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross) to clarify that private flood insurance may be an available option for homeowners to satisfy mandatory coverage requirements under the National Flood Insurance Program. For Florida homeowners, this is a win-win, giving them more options for flood insurance coverage and using new competition to drive down prices and expand coverage options for consumers. The National Flood Insurance Program is an important tool that empowers and protects homeowners all across America. The Biggert-Waters Act of 2012 took an important step in opening up the market and allowing private flood insurance policies to satisfy mandatory coverage requirements under the program. However, as we have learned, sometimes even the best laid plans can have unintended consequences. With a lack of clarity as to which private flood insurance policies are allowed in the program, the market has not been able to expand, and consumers have been left with just one choice to insure their properties from flood risk: the National Flood Insurance Program. I recently heard from one of my constituents in Martin County, Florida, about how the premium for just 1 year of flood insurance coverage through the NFIP ended up being five times the price they expected it to be. To make matters worse, the maximum coverage was only half of what they paid for the home itself; yet they were required to purchase the higher priced plan that did not provide the coverage they needed because there were no other options. This highlights the urgent need to allow competition in the flood insurance marketplace to meet homeowners' needs and drive down costs. But to do that, we must allow the States to license and regulate flood insurance policies, exactly like homeowners insurance, car insurance, or health insurance. Yet, almost inexplicably, Florida's private flood insurance market remains restrained because homeowners are not given the choice to look to private market policies for more flood insurance options. The bank will not accept other policies because their regulators haven't approved them. This bill will solve this problem by allowing State insurance commissioners, who have long been considered by Congress as the most appropriate regulators of insurance, to certify private insurance plans to provide equivalent or better protections for flood insurance other than the NFIP plan. Everyone I talk to agrees that Florida's insurance commissioner is certainly better equipped to regulate flood insurance in our State than the Federal banking regulators. By breaking this down, we break down a major barrier to marketplace expansion. This legislation will foster more competition, greatly benefiting homeowners across Florida and the Nation. I thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman Hensarling, for his leadership on this issue. I also extend my deep gratitude to the gentlewoman from California, Ranking Member Waters, for her relentless advocacy for consumers and for working with us to improve this legislation and produce a solid, bipartisan outcome. I appreciate all of my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee for moving this commonsense measure forward with unanimous, bipartisan support. [[Page H1961]] {time} 1615 I am hopeful that today it will be passed by the full House with similar support and will be swiftly considered in the Senate.

A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1959-H1961] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FOREIGN SPILL PROTECTION ACT OF 2016 Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1684) to amend the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to impose penalties and provide for the recovery of removal costs and damages in connection with certain discharges of oil from foreign offshore units, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1684 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Spill Protection Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. LIABILITY OF OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF FOREIGN FACILITIES. (a) Oil Pollution Control Act Amendments.--Section 1001 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2701) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (26)(A)-- (A) in clause (ii), by striking ``onshore or offshore facility, any person'' and inserting ``onshore facility, offshore facility, or foreign offshore unit or other facility located seaward of the exclusive economic zone, any person or entity''; and (B) in clause (iii), by striking ``offshore facility, the person who'' and inserting ``offshore facility or foreign offshore unit or other facility located seaward of the exclusive economic zone, the person or entity that''; and (2) in paragraph (32)-- (A) by redesignating subparagraphs (D) through (F) as subparagraphs (E) through (G), respectively; (B) by inserting after subparagraph (C) the following: ``(D) Foreign facilities.--In the case of a foreign offshore unit or other facility located seaward of the exclusive economic zone, any person or other entity owning or operating the facility, and any leaseholder, permit holder, assignee, or holder of a right of use and easement granted under applicable foreign law for the area in which the facility is located.''; and (C) in subparagraph (G), as so redesignated, by striking ``or offshore facility, the persons who'' and inserting ``, offshore facility, or foreign offshore unit or other facility located seaward of the exclusive economic zone, the persons or entities that''. (b) Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments.-- Section 311(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1321(a)(11)) is amended-- (1) by striking ``and any facility'' and inserting ``any facility''; and (2) by inserting ``, and, for the purposes of applying subsections (b), (c), (e), and (o), any foreign offshore unit (as defined in section 1001 of the Oil Pollution Act) or any other facility located seaward of the exclusive economic zone'' after ``public vessel''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1684. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, following the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska in 1989, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA. The basic premise of OPA is that the party responsible for the spill is responsible for all of the costs of cleaning up the mess. The Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010 reminded us of the impact a spill of its size can have on waters, coastlines, people, and our economy. It is important to note that these offshore facilities, as defined by OPA, are limited only to the navigable waters of the United States, and foreign rigs cannot be designated as responsible parties. Therefore, if there were an oil spill originating in foreign waters, the most the responsible party would have to pay to clean up American waters and shores is $150 million. This issue is of particular concern to Gulf States. Mexico, Cuba, and the Bahamas are actively looking at expanding their offshore drilling operations. Of particular concern is Mexico, which is looking into ultradeep wells, exceeding 6,000 feet in depth. In 2012, Mexico's top oil regulators said they were not prepared to handle a serious accident or major oil spill. But it is not just the Gulf States that could be negatively affected by a spill. On the Canadian side of Lake Erie, offshore energy exploration is being conducted for natural gas. While Canadian law prohibits oil extraction from the Great Lakes, the risk of a spill persists. Again, under current law, the responsible party would only have to pay a maximum of $150 million for cleanup. In response to these concerns, my friend from Florida, Representative [[Page H1960]] Patrick Murphy, and I introduced the legislation that is being considered here today. The bill ensures that the responsible party, regardless of origin, pays for all American cleanup costs by applying OPA. This will also apply Clean Water Act penalties to the responsible foreign party. I am proud that this legislation has broad bipartisan support and has been endorsed by environmental fishing and other groups that depend on the water for their livelihoods. Our coastal communities need peace of mind that if they are harmed by a foreign spill, resources are available to clean up their shores and help them recover. American taxpayers should not have to foot the bill to bail out the mistakes of foreign companies. I would like to thank and commend the Coast Guard and the majority and minority staffs of the committee, particularly John Rayfield and Dave Jansen, for their work on this important legislation. H.R. 1684 is a very straightforward bill that looks to hold the party responsible for a foreign oil spill that affects U.S. waters or lands accountable. I urge all Members to support it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this noncontroversial legislation that will clarify existing Federal authority regarding the liability for and enforcement of offshore oil spills originating from a foreign source outside the U.S. exclusive economic zone. H.R. 1684, the Foreign Spill Protection Act of 2016, clarifies that owners and operators of oil production facilities located offshore and outside the United States are liable for cleanup costs and damages from oil spills. These foreign entities are responsible for oil spills that originate outside U.S. waters if they threaten or cause damage in the United States. The foreign entities would be subject to criminal and civil penalties, Federal removal authority, and any State-authorized remedy currently allowed under Federal and State law. I would like to commend the cooperation shown by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Shuster, Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee Chairman Hunter, and Ranking Member Garamendi in working out the final details of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, the Deepwater Horizon disaster painfully reminded us of how catastrophic an offshore oil spill can be, both in its geographic reach and in its environmental and economic costs. The settled liability and enforcement regimes authorized under the Oil Pollution Act and the Clean Water Act have proven themselves to be comprehensive, durable, and effective. In the event of a spill, this response regime has ensured time and time again that the Federal Government has clear, unequivocal authority to respond to a spill, restore the environment and communities harmed, and recover damages for the harm caused. This legislation will in no way impede or change those indispensable authorities. In closing, it is a helpful enhancement to clarify that spills originating from foreign sources fall under this well-established legal regime. I ask Members on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

oregon (mr. defazio) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from florida. general leave mr. curbelo of florida. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h.r. 1684. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from florida? there was no objection. mr. curbelo of florida. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, following the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989, congress passed the oil pollution act of 1990, or opa. the basic premise of opa is that the party responsible for the spill is responsible for all of the costs of cleaning up the mess. the deepwater horizon spill in 2010 reminded us of the impact a spill of its size can have on waters, coastlines, people, and our economy. it is important to note that these offshore facilities, as defined by opa, are limited only to the navigable waters of the united states, and foreign rigs cannot be designated as responsible parties. therefore, if there were an oil spill originating in foreign waters, the most the responsible party would have to pay to clean up american waters and shores is $150 million. this issue is of particular concern to gulf states. mexico, cuba, and the bahamas are actively looking at expanding their offshore drilling operations. of particular concern is mexico, which is looking into ultradeep wells, exceeding 6,000 feet in depth. in 2012, mexico's top oil regulators said they were not prepared to handle a serious accident or major oil spill. but it is not just the gulf states that could be negatively affected by a spill. on the canadian side of lake erie, offshore energy exploration is being conducted for natural gas. while canadian law prohibits oil extraction from the great lakes, the risk of a spill persists. again, under current law, the responsible party would only have to pay a maximum of $150 million for cleanup. in response to these concerns, my friend from florida, representative [[page h1960]] patrick murphy, and i introduced the legislation that is being considered here today. the bill ensures that the responsible party, regardless of origin, pays for all american cleanup costs by applying opa. this will also apply clean water act penalties to the responsible foreign party. i am proud that this legislation has broad bipartisan support and has been endorsed by environmental fishing and other groups that depend on the water for their livelihoods. our coastal communities need peace of mind that if they are harmed by a foreign spill, resources are available to clean up their shores and help them recover. american taxpayers should not have to foot the bill to bail out the mistakes of foreign companies. i would like to thank and commend the coast guard and the majority and minority staffs of the committee, particularly john rayfield and dave jansen, for their work on this important legislation. h.r. 1684 is a very straightforward bill that looks to hold the party responsible for a foreign oil spill that affects u.s. waters or lands accountable. i urge all members to support it. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of this noncontroversial legislation that will clarify existing federal authority regarding the liability for and enforcement of offshore oil spills originating from a foreign source outside the u.s. exclusive economic zone. h.r. 1684, the foreign spill protection act of 2016, clarifies that owners and operators of oil production facilities located offshore and outside the united states are liable for cleanup costs and damages from oil spills. these foreign entities are responsible for oil spills that originate outside u.s. waters if they threaten or cause damage in the united states. the foreign entities would be subject to criminal and civil penalties, federal removal authority, and any state-authorized remedy currently allowed under federal and state law. i would like to commend the cooperation shown by the committee on transportation and infrastructure chairman shuster, coast guard and maritime transportation subcommittee chairman hunter, and ranking member garamendi in working out the final details of this legislation. mr. speaker, the deepwater horizon disaster painfully reminded us of how catastrophic an offshore oil spill can be, both in its geographic reach and in its environmental and economic costs. the settled liability and enforcement regimes authorized under the oil pollution act and the clean water act have proven themselves to be comprehensive, durable, and effective. in the event of a spill, this response regime has ensured time and time again that the federal government has clear, unequivocal authority to respond to a spill, restore the environment and communities harmed, and recover damages for the harm caused. this legislation will in no way impede or change those indispensable authorities. in closing, it is a helpful enhancement to clarify that spills originating from foreign sources fall under this well-established legal regime. i ask members on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. curbelo of florida. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i would like to thank the ranking member, mr. defazio, for his statement and for his cooperation on this legislation. i also want to thank chairman shuster. as the gentleman mentioned, the transportation and infrastructure committee is oftentimes an example of how we can put politics aside to work together and do good things for the american people. this legislation is very important to my constituents in south florida, in the florida keys, and, really, to coastal communities all over the country. so i thank the gentleman for his statement. i thank everyone who had a part in crafting this legislation. i urge all of my colleagues to support it. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from florida (mr. murphy), who is vitally interested and concerned about this legislation. mr. murphy of florida. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from florida and i thank the gentleman from oregon for their tireless efforts to protect our environment. as the gentleman from florida and i know firsthand, so much of our economy is based on our environment. making sure that we have clean water and clean air is exactly what we need to be focused on. i urge my colleagues to support this bill, ensuring the party responsible for such oil spills is held liable. hopefully, we get bipartisan support going forward. i thank the two gentlemen for their work putting this forward. i would also like to rise today in support of h.r. 2901, the flood insurance market parity and modernization act. i was proud to put this bipartisan legislation forward with my good friend, another gentleman from florida (mr. ross) to clarify that private flood insurance may be an available option for homeowners to satisfy mandatory coverage requirements under the national flood insurance program. for florida homeowners, this is a win-win, giving them more options for flood insurance coverage and using new competition to drive down prices and expand coverage options for consumers. the national flood insurance program is an important tool that empowers and protects homeowners all across america. the biggert-waters act of 2012 took an important step in opening up the market and allowing private flood insurance policies to satisfy mandatory coverage requirements under the program. however, as we have learned, sometimes even the best laid plans can have unintended consequences. with a lack of clarity as to which private flood insurance policies are allowed in the program, the market has not been able to expand, and consumers have been left with just one choice to insure their properties from flood risk: the national flood insurance program. i recently heard from one of my constituents in martin county, florida, about how the premium for just 1 year of flood insurance coverage through the nfip ended up being five times the price they expected it to be. to make matters worse, the maximum coverage was only half of what they paid for the home itself; yet they were required to purchase the higher priced plan that did not provide the coverage they needed because there were no other options. this highlights the urgent need to allow competition in the flood insurance marketplace to meet homeowners' needs and drive down costs. but to do that, we must allow the states to license and regulate flood insurance policies, exactly like homeowners insurance, car insurance, or health insurance. yet, almost inexplicably, florida's private flood insurance market remains restrained because homeowners are not given the choice to look to private market policies for more flood insurance options. the bank will not accept other policies because their regulators haven't approved them. this bill will solve this problem by allowing state insurance commissioners, who have long been considered by congress as the most appropriate regulators of insurance, to certify private insurance plans to provide equivalent or better protections for flood insurance other than the nfip plan. everyone i talk to agrees that florida's insurance commissioner is certainly better equipped to regulate flood insurance in our state than the federal banking regulators. by breaking this down, we break down a major barrier to marketplace expansion. this legislation will foster more competition, greatly benefiting homeowners across florida and the nation. i thank the gentleman from texas, chairman hensarling, for his leadership on this issue. i also extend my deep gratitude to the gentlewoman from california, ranking member waters, for her relentless advocacy for consumers and for working with us to improve this legislation and produce a solid, bipartisan outcome. i appreciate all of my colleagues on the financial services committee for moving this commonsense measure forward with unanimous, bipartisan support. [[page h1961]] {time} 1615 i am hopeful that today it will be passed by the full house with similar support and will be swiftly considered in the senate. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 2901, the flood insurance market parity and modernization act. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. curbelo of florida. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i thank my colleague from florida (mr. murphy), whom i saw in the everglades on friday. we were celebrating another great victory for floridians there. here today we are again celebrating that we have been able to get something done with the support of our colleagues on behalf of the people of our state. we decided early on in this congress that we would work together to protect our coastal communities, and that is exactly what we are doing here today. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from florida (mr. curbelo) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1684, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",14564
CREC-2016-04-26-pt1-PgH1961,CREC-2016-04-26,114,COMBATING TERRORIST RECRUITMENT ACT OF 2016,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1961-H1966] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMBATING TERRORIST RECRUITMENT ACT OF 2016 Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4820) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to use the testimonials of former or estranged violent extremists or their associates in order to counter terrorist recruitment, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4820 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. DIRECTIVE. (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall incorporate, to the extent practicable, into Department of Homeland Security efforts to combat terrorist recruitment and communications the public testimonials of former violent extremists or their associates, including friends and family. Such efforts may include the following: (1) Counter-messaging of foreign terrorist organization communications and narratives. (2) Related community engagement and public education efforts. (b) Coordination.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, where appropriate, coordinate the efforts described in subsection (a) with the heads of other Federal departments and agencies, as appropriate, and, to the extent practicable, engage nongovernmental and international partners in the identification and use of testimonials described in such subsection. (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be construed to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to collect testimonials directly from former violent extremists or their associates, including friends and family. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous materials to the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016. I commend Mr. Fleischmann for offering this bipartisan counterterrorism bill at a time when we are in the highest terror threat environment since 9/11. We have more than 1,000 homegrown terror investigations in all 50 States, and we have arrested over 80 ISIS supporters in our country, many for plotting attacks. Terrorists are radicalizing our citizens online and across borders, which is why we need this legislation. It requires that the Secretary of Homeland Security use the testimonials of former extremists and defectors to help stop terrorist recruitment. President Obama himself--and I agree with him on this issue--argued last year: We need to lift up the voice of those who know the hypocrisy of groups like ISIS firsthand, including former extremists. He also noted: ``Former extremists . . . can be powerful messengers in debunking these terrorist ideologies.'' Our foreign partners are already using these types of testimonials overseas. So is our State Department. But we need to be doing this counter-messaging here at home. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in front of my committee last month: My priority has been focusing on communities that I believe are most vulnerable to the appeals from ISIS, al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups overseas who are actively targeting individuals in these communities . . . This is as important as any of our other homeland security missions. I commend Secretary Johnson for his words and his work, but we are not acting quickly enough. That is why this bill was one of the top recommendations of the bipartisan task force we created last year to look at this threat. In their final report, the Democratic and Republican Members who led the task force said America needed to launch a concerted effort to use the testimonials of former extremists to combat terrorist propaganda. This is from a Virginia defector. Just last month an ISIS defector from Virginia was picked up in Iraq. He said he wanted to send a message to the American people that life with ISIS was miserable and that the group did not represent Islam. These are the types of voices we need to amplify so as to keep others from making the same mistakes. Some have argued that this bill limits the DHS in allowing it only to counter-message groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, but that is simply false. In fact, at our markup, legislative counsel told the members: ``The current language in the bill is extremely broad-based. It does not place a limitation on anything.'' Although our bipartisan task force focused on foreign terrorist threats, the bill gives the Secretary the flexibility to address the full array of dangerous groups that threaten our people both here at home and abroad. I am proud to say that the majority of Republicans and Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee support this legislation. Terrorists are recruiting our citizens at the speed of broadband. So we can't move at the speed of bureaucracy. Today Congress has an opportunity to fight back. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in opposition to H.R. 4820, the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016. It is troubling that some of my colleagues have circulated misinformation about this bill. Let me set the record straight. The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly told my committee that H.R. 4820 is unnecessary insofar as the Department can already integrate public testimonials of former terrorists and violent extremists into its efforts to counter violent extremism and terrorism. In fact, yesterday I spoke with Secretary Johnson, and he reiterated that DHS has the authority it needs to carry out its countering violent extremism efforts and that this bill is unnecessary. I oppose H.R. 4820 today for the same reason I opposed it when it was considered earlier this month in committee. H.R. 4820 is nothing more than a message bill, a bill that sends the message to DHS to focus its counter-messaging efforts on foreign terrorist groups. [[Page H1962]] Domestic terror groups, like foreign terrorist organizations, recruit and spread propaganda through social media and online platforms. This bill ignores the fact that domestic terror groups, like foreign terrorist organizations, kill Americans. Since September 11, terrorists who have espoused their ideology of foreign terrorist organizations have been responsible for killing 45 innocent Americans on U.S. soil. During that same period, members of domestic terrorist organizations have murdered more than 48 Americans. If you ask law enforcement leaders across this country what keeps them up at night, they will likely say the prospect that there is a sovereign citizen group or militia plotting in their jurisdictions. Just last month the Atlanta police chief testified before my committee that he is deeply concerned about homegrown extremists and militia activity. His testimony echoes the results of a recent survey in which 74 percent of law enforcement identified anti-government extremism as one of the three terrorist threats in their jurisdictions. In the last 2 months, we have seen the development of domestic terrorists: an attack on police officers in Georgia by a self-appointed wizard of the Ku Klux Klan; the conviction by a Federal grand jury in Mississippi of two members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Mississippi for their participation in various criminal acts, including those of drug production, trafficking, kidnapping, and murder; the indictment of two members of a sovereign citizen group in Columbus, Ohio, for building a bomb that was modeled after the suicide vests that were used in the November Paris attack; a four-count indictment against a member of a Michigan sovereign citizen group for selling women and children into sexual slavery. Such abusive activities are chillingly similar to those of ISIL. In recognition of these facts, I, together with like-minded committee Democrats, made multiple proposals during and after the markup to fix the bill. We offered an amendment to define ``violent extremist'' to encompass not only those engaged in ideologically motivated international terrorism, but also in domestic terrorism. It was rejected. We offered an amendment to insert ``domestic terrorist organization.'' It was also rejected. Even after the markup, we made three more proposals to fix the bill. Each was rejected. By refusing to include any mention of domestic terrorist organizations, H.R. 4820 represents a significant departure from the holistic, comprehensive approach that has been espoused by the Obama administration to counter ideologically based violence. Since 2011, with the publication of the ``Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Extremism in the United States'' strategy by the White House, Federal efforts to prevent such terrorism have been guided by the recognition that violent extremists are inspired by a range of religious, political, or other ideological beliefs. The passage of H.R. 4820 would send the wrong message. As such, I urge a ``no'' vote. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Chattanooga, Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann), the sponsor and author of the bill. Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 4820, the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act. I wish to thank Chairman McCaul and the members of the Homeland Security Committee for all of their hard work on this bill. I will never forget the moment back in July--I was standing on this floor--when I was told about the shootings at two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the town in which I live and proudly represent. As many of you may remember, four marines and one sailor were killed in the attack while several others were wounded. Just this past December, following the FBI investigation, Director James Comey concluded that the shootings ``were motivated by foreign terrorist organization propaganda.'' Given the recent attacks in Chattanooga and San Bernardino, as well as in Paris and Brussels, we need to use every tool in the toolbox to combat this new brand of extremism. This bill implements one of the key recommendations made by the Homeland Security Committee's bipartisan task force, one that is specifically designed to counter terrorism and foreign fighter travel. This bill does not forbid DHS from countering all forms of extremism, but the bill does provide examples of how DHS can fulfill the requirement, such as counter-messaging foreign terrorist organizations, which are actively recruiting in our country at an alarming rate. This bipartisan legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to amplify the testimonials of former extremists and defectors to fight the propaganda and the recruitment of terrorist groups like ISIS. Foreign terrorists are using technology to radicalize Americans at a troubling pace, which continues to increase. More than 250 Americans have traveled or have attempted to travel to fight with jihadists in Syria and Iraq, and the FBI says there are open counterterrorism investigations in all 50 States, mostly ISIS related. Many of these individuals were pulled in by terrorist propaganda. {time} 1630 ISIS is luring Americans with empty and false promises that do not reflect the true reality on the ground in places like Syria and Iraq. The true reality centers on fear, suffering, and the murder of innocent people throughout the region and around the world. Several recent defectors from ISIS have admitted that joining the group was a terrible mistake. One young fighter said he found it very hard to live there and no longer believes the group represents their religion. We need to do all we can to amplify the messages from these disillusioned terrorists who have firsthand experience with the evil and hypocrisy of these extremist groups. The State Department and many of our key allies already utilize the testimony of those disaffected by the true reality of these terror groups, and the concept was also endorsed by the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Advisory Council last spring. Unfortunately, there may be partisan opposition to this bipartisan bill. The majority of the Homeland Security committee members, on both sides of the aisle, supported the bill in committee. I will say it again: this bill received a majority of votes from both sides of the aisle in committee. Let's not put partisanship ever ahead of our Nation's security. This is a commonsense measure to hinder those recruiting efforts of groups like ISIS with the testimony of those who have seen the evil of these groups firsthand. I urge the support of my colleagues. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman). Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4820, the so-called Combating Terrorist Recruitment Bill. H.R. 4820 omits any mention of domestic terrorist organizations, a significant departure from the holistic, comprehensive approach that is adopted by the administration to counter ideologically based violence. This bill isolates the enemy to be those who are Islamist, those who are foreign, and those who are being radicalized by foreigners. How does this bill address the threat of terror from those who are not just jaded jihadists, like this bill was initially titled, but, rather, a part of domestic militia or part of a rightwing, ultra- conservative, racist organization that wants to kill African Americans or other vulnerable populations? A recent study by the Police Executive Research Forum and the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security found that State and local law enforcement personnel are almost twice as concerned about rightwing and antigovernment terrorism as they are about the threat from al Qaeda, ISIS, and similar groups. The concerns of State and local law enforcement about domestic terrorism are well placed. Within the last year, we have seen a rightwing terrorist kill [[Page H1963]] nine people at Mother Emanuel in Charleston and an anti-abortion terrorist kill three people at the Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado. Since the attacks of 9/11, within the United States, domestic terrorists have killed 48 people, more than those killed by foreign terrorist-inspired attacks. Shouldn't we be concerned about those who have demonstrated the greatest threat to our homeland in the last 15 years? H.R. 4820 represents a marked departure from a national strategy to combat terrorism and that recognizes that individuals who promote and use violence against the U.S. are inspired by a range of religious, political, or other ideological beliefs. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Curbelo of Florida). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. This bill only serves to perpetuate the stigma associated with just one group of people who happen to practice Islam. It does not recognize a full range of terrorist threats to our homeland. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 4820. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), the original cosponsor of the bill and the chairman of the bipartisan task force. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for offering this legislation. Mr. Speaker, America continues to witness the largest convergence of radical Islamic threats in the history of our country. More than any threat before, ISIS demonstrated an ability to radicalize individuals throughout the world by utilizing the Internet. However, these individuals are met with the cold, hard reality that ISIS does not offer luxury, happiness, or peacefulness. On the contrary, these individuals are thrust onto the battlefield with little or no training and little or no regard for their lives. Some, when faced with the truth, try to turn back. Among those who recognize ISIS for the barbaric, destructive force that it is, some have actually dared to speak out against them, using their experience to dissuade others from risking their lives in order to wage war on innocent people. One of these individuals was mentioned by my colleague, Chairman Mike McCaul, and that individual grew up across the river from here in Alexandria, Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the efforts of our law enforcement and intelligence officials by supporting this bill. The Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016, of which I am a cosponsor, requires a dissemination of testimonials from ISIS defectors to help stop the radicalization of at-risk individuals. This bill comes from the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, of which I served as a Republican lead. Using these testimonials would fill a gap that our bipartisan task force identified in a bipartisan manner. I thank Chairman McCaul, who has led this effort. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I certainly don't question the motivations of the gentleman who has sponsored this bill. He is a good man, a good American, and loves his country, but I believe it is misdirected. I really do. In my hand, if you remember, there is a report from 2009, the beginning of the Obama administration. All that work was done in the previous administration on this report. The report is quite revealing. Anybody who is on Homeland Security should read it because it tells us that we need not only to carry out the oath of office, half of it, but we should defend the country against foreign intruders. Also, it says in our oath ``domestic'' as well. This report lays out very clearly what is going on in the United States of America in our backyards. It was squashed. I remember the day when a Democratic Secretary of the Homeland Security heard from me about it, that she should not have bent over because those on the other side wanted this report squashed. There have been articles written since that time, 2009, of how it was squashed. They didn't want the American people to read this. That is quite, quite a report. So I rise in opposition, Mr. Speaker, to H.R. 4820. No one loves this country more than the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson). I am not on that committee anymore, but no one respects it more than Bennie Thompson. Why is he opposed to this? Is he opposed to this because he doesn't love his country as much as the folks on the other side of the aisle? I don't think so. Does he oppose it because he didn't sponsor it? I don't think so. He opposes it because this excludes very specific things which we should not exclude. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New Jersey an additional 1 minute. Mr. PASCRELL. The House should not be picking and choosing what sources of terrorism the Department should focus on without taking into account all the facts. The House continues to ignore the threats posed by violent extremism, which are not limited to a single ideology. Eric Hoffer, in the book ``The True Believer,'' written many years ago, said that extremism is inspired by a range of reasons, including religious, political, or ideological beliefs. He says that these movements, regardless of the motive or end goal, simply need isolated individuals who are dispossessed in some way or other and need to feel part of something bigger than themselves. Why don't we really get at the sources of the people who want to kill our kids and want to damage our properties, whether they come from afar or whether they are grown right here? Homegrown. Homegrown. And we are ignoring it. The FBI reports that time and time again. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd). Mr. HURD of Texas. ``It's not a revolution or jihad. It's a slaughter. I was shocked by what I did.'' ``I found it very, very hard to live there. ISIS fighters don't represent the religion. I don't see them as good Muslims.'' Mr. Speaker, those are the words of Americans who traveled overseas to fight alongside ISIS. They left home believing they were headed toward a great adventure. They were promised glory and honor, but what they found was death and a perversion of the religion they believe in. These fighters were originally recruited to fight for ISIS through social media. Every day ISIS spreads their lies and propaganda, drawing in naive young Americans. They do this in dozens of different languages, reaching people across the world. Even while ISIS loses ground on the battlefield, they are working hard to make it up in the digital sphere. The Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act will allow us to take these powerful words of truth and use them to combat the lies that ISIS is spreading on social media. Some may say this is unnecessary. Some may say: Why aren't we already doing this? We aren't. That is why we need this piece of legislation. This bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to use the testimonials of former extremists and defectors as part of an ongoing effort to stop terrorist recruitment. These are individuals who have seen the brutality of terrorist groups firsthand and have rejected it. This bill is not limited to specific groups. Let me repeat that one more time: This bill is not limited to specific groups. It gives our counterterrorism professionals the flexibility needed to fight back against extremists as the threat environment and terrorist tactics change. It also requires DHS to coordinate these efforts with other agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and foreign partners so that we do this the right way, finding the best outlets for undermining terrorist propaganda. [[Page H1964]] The bipartisan Foreign Fighter Task Force I served on recommends that we use these credible voices to fight against ISIS' online efforts. The nonpartisan Homeland Security Advisory Council has urged DHS to use the testimonials of former extremists in our counternarrative efforts. Our foreign partners are already using these tactics and finding them effective. Our young people are being targeted. We have the tools to help protect them. These tools can stop others in our hometowns from making a terrible mistake. We need to get in the online fight, but time is not on our side. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act. Having spent 9\1/2\ years as an undercover officer chasing terrorists across the world, there is no such thing as a silver bullet. We have to do this piecemeal, and this bill is one step going in that direction. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the ranking member on the House Transportation Committee. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as one who served from the creation of the Homeland Security Committee until just a couple of years ago. I am concerned about what I am hearing here today on the floor, and I am surprised. Perhaps we should insert the word ``some,'' combating some terrorist recruitment in 2016. Now, the chairman said that DHS certainly has the flexibility to address domestic terrorism. Well, that is true. But why leave out explicit mention of domestic terrorism? {time} 1645 Are you afraid of offending some rightwing nuts out there? What is the deal? Seriously, I just went through this in Oregon. I have been on the Department of Justice and the FBI for about 2 years: Go get Cliven Bundy, get his cattle off the land, put the guy in jail. They didn't do it. And what happened? He taught his kids the way it was done. You show the government a gun, and they will run away, and you keep doing what you want, and you can deny that the Federal Government has the right to own any public lands in this country and try and take them over for private individuals. Now, this is a serious threat. The Murrah building, there were no foreign terrorists involved, 168 dead, hundreds injured, and we can't explicitly put into this bill all terrorism, including domestic terrorism. I really fear that some are worried that some of these rightwing extremist groups out there might be offended if we were to say that they are a threat to our Nation. Well, they are very much a threat, and this bill omitting that should have this bill denied passage on this floor and bring it back in a comprehensive way next week. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan). Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4820, the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act authored by Mr. Fleischmann. This bill is one step in implementing the recommendations of the Committee on Homeland Security's Foreign Fighter Task Force. This bipartisan team was charged with studying how our government can combat Western citizens who become radicalized and take up arms with terrorists. The President, senior national security officials, industry leaders, and experts have all expressed support for this concept. While all self-radicalized terrorists deserve the consequences of their behavior, some realize just how profound they were mistaken after seeing the reality of life under ISIS. They sometimes recant and tell the truth about the atrocities that they have witnessed or committed. That is valuable information. What this bill does is common sense. It directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to use testimony from these individuals as part of our efforts to combat violent extremists. President Obama himself stated that we need to ``lift up the voices'' of former extremists in order to expose the hypocrisy of ISIS, but this bill does not limit the Department's ability to countermeasure terrorist groups that threaten us no matter where they are located. As we speak, ISIS is using social media and the Internet to radicalize young Americans who are vulnerable to a message of inclusion in a grand cause, no matter how sinister. Before they make a mistake that could cause them and others their lives, let's take every opportunity to counter ISIS' poisonous narrative. To hear from others like them who wanted to believe in ISIS and found the truth too late is a tactic we should utilize. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, which received bipartisan support in committee. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and I am prepared to close. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry). Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee for offering this bill, as well as Chairman McCaul for bringing it to the floor. When the terrorists attacked in San Bernardino, many Americans said: What are we doing? When you find out that these folks are trafficking on the Internet and messaging, they say: Where is our FBI? Where are the services protecting us, and why aren't they doing everything they can? This is one thing they can do is offer testimonials from people who have been there who can give other people who might be interested in joining the truth. Yet there are some folks here who don't want to do that. They are interested in misrepresenting this bill. I want to remind everybody that this bill is the result of a bipartisan task force, a bipartisan task force, Member-led, that said we need to do exactly this, and unanimously move this forward to the full committee. They say it is unnecessary. Well, if it is unnecessary, why isn't Homeland Security doing this already? Why not? How long are they going to wait? They say that they offered amendments. Really? They offered amendments? They couldn't be bothered to answer the chairman's call when he said: Hey, can you collaborate with us on this so we have a good bill that everybody is involved in. They waited until the day of the markup, and then came in with a bunch of amendments and concerns. It was apparent that all they wanted to do was slow the process down and, as a matter of fact, move the process to some other date. How long are we going to wait? Do you want to ask the relatives of those who are killed by these people how long they want to wait? How about the next ones? Now, some on the other side have picked this up as this is a politically motivated agenda. I say some because not all. As a matter of fact, many on the other side voted to move this bill right to the floor where it is now. I don't understand why they would want to have America be less safe. I don't understand, Mr. Speaker. We spent 4 hours--4 hours--going over a two-page bill. Two pages. We entertained what they wanted to change, and we did make some changes, but it was apparent that all they wanted to really do was stall and stall and move this process forward down the line and never get to it. Mr. Speaker, we don't have any choice. We have to move forward now. Those in opposition are simply willfully refusing to see what all America sees. We need to address this threat immediately. It is a two- page bill, and it doesn't deny Homeland Security from doing anything that it has already been doing. As a matter of fact, these folks on the other side demanded at that markup--they demanded--that we say that Homeland Security must do this. And the chairman said: Okay, if you want to demand that they do it, we will demand that they do it. Mr. Speaker, I think we ought to make America safe and pass this bill. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, from Boston to Charleston, we have seen individuals operating within our communities and living among us plot to cause mass harm in the name of a violent extremist and hateful ideology. Today much has been made of the fact that the FBI has open investigations of ISIL-inspired activity in all 50 States. Far less [[Page H1965]] attention has been given to the number of open investigations of anti- government and militia groups, a number that grew by one-third in 2015 alone. We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the threats posed by any terrorist group or organization, as the bill before us today would do. Therefore, it is imperative that DHS use testimonials from violent extremists involved in all forms of violent extremism. Public testimonials can be a powerful tool to reach individuals who otherwise might be susceptible to terrorist propaganda. Given the diversity in the threat landscape that we face, it just makes sense that any such effort should be comprehensive. Unfortunately, the bill's sponsors have decided that this bill should turn away from the comprehensive approach. Mr. Speaker, again, let me indicate that the only real issue before us is the domestic aspect of terrorism. Domestic terrorist organizations have demonstrated time and time again, they have killed more Americans here on our soil than foreign terrorists have. The reason we are in opposition is we don't recognize that in this legislation. Our effort in markup, as well as here on the floor, is to make sure that all of the bad people get recognized, those international and foreign, but also those who are domestic. Some of us have lived in parts of the country where domestic terrorism was a way of life for a lot of us, and because of that, we are very passionate on that subject. The Charleston situation was very unfortunate. That was an act of domestic terrorism. There is no question about it. So why wouldn't we want to add those kind of extremist activities in this legislation so we can cover everyone? That is really the opposition that we have had. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 4820. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, Paris, Brussels, Chattanooga, San Bernardino. How many more? Mr. Speaker, it is time to act, and act today on this important legislation that is bipartisan. It is important to point out--I know the ranking member has good intentions, but our bill allows DHS to combat terrorist recruitment by all dangerous organizations, as was brought out at the markup. The President's Homeland Security adviser, Lisa Monaco, said: ``Our efforts will be the most effective when they focus on amplifying authentic voices,'' such as former violent extremists. These voices can convince others from going down the path to violence. The President's national security adviser, Susan Rice, added that they are already amplifying the voices of ISIL defectors overseas. And she explains that ``these voices are eroding ISIL's appeal.'' This countermessaging works, and it has worked for the State Department, but we are not doing it at home. We need to do it here at home and not just overseas. That is why I urge strong support for this. I don't understand after it being the product of a bipartisan task force with bipartisan support out of the committee, the very week that the Brussels attack occurred, we marked up this bill. Mr. Speaker, it is time to act. I urge passage of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 4820, the ``Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016,'' because regrettably the bill was not improved as I had hoped and expected between the Committee markup and, floor consideration. Specifically, Section 2 of H.R. 4820, directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, inter alia, to employ ``Counter-messaging of foreign terrorist organization communications and narratives.'' However, the bill is silent on the issue of domestic terrorists and the threat they pose to the safety and security of Americans. This was a point raised by the minority members during the markup, but an agreement could not be reached to include the words ``and domestic terrorist'' in the bill. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I appreciate the concerns the bill is intended to address but in my view the bill's scope is too limited in view of the number and frequency of violent domestic extremist attacks such as the one occurring in the evening of June 17, 2015 at the historic Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Combating violent extremism is too important to become the subject of partisan political disputes. Instead, we should work together to find common ground that reconciles the competing interests of collective security and individual liberties. We must not focus on one religion as being a threat--this would be wrong and counterproductive. Mr. Speaker, there have been other attacks by foreign and domestic violent extremists. The Fort Hood Texas attack committed by Major Nidal Malik Hasan, who opened fire and killed 13 U.S. military personnel. The Boston Marathon attackers were two Chechen brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev who carried out a bombing that took 3 lives and injured 264 others. Later, the brothers killed university police officer Sean A. Collier. On December 2, 2015, 14 people were killed and 22 were seriously injured in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, which consisted of a mass shooting and an attempted bombing. The perpetrators, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, a married couple living in the city of Redlands, who the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health training event and holiday party, of about 80 employees. This threat of attack by foreign terrorists on American soil is real and substantial and requires vigilance by the Administration and this Congress. However, threats of domestic terrorist attacks are also real. Mr. Speaker, we cannot be unmindful of the fact that since September 2001, there have been 250 deaths at the hands of home grown violent extremists as opposed by 50 by foreign terrorists. The seminal act of homegrown domestic terror occurred in 1995, when the domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh detonated the truck bomb that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 persons and injured over 680 people. At the time, it is the largest loss of American lives at the hands of a domestic terror group since the Civil War. Today, the challenge is countering the messages of violent extremism no matter the source and not to fall for thinking that one type of violent extremism is less of a threat than another type of violent extremism. Radical and extremist groups, both domestic and international, systematically prey upon the vulnerabilities of young persons by offering inducements such as financial assistance, familial-like bonds, or the promise of an exciting and heroic life. In some cases, youth have been forcibly recruited or tricked into participating in terrorist activities, including suicide bombings. The heinous attack in Mother Emmanuel Church was a defining moment in our nation's history for many reasons, but the final chapter will be written by those who are charged with keeping our nation and its people safe while preserving the way of life that terrorist seek to change. One of the enduring challenges for members of the Homeland Security Committee is how we guide the work of the Department of Homeland Security. I hosted DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson in Houston for two days of discussions, and tours that were insightful and probing on a range of regional and national homeland security issues. The issue of violent extremism is one of several efforts that the Department of Homeland Security has prioritized and begun efforts to address both the international threat and the domestic threats. DHS defines ``Domestic Terrorism'' as: ``Any act of violence that is dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources committed by a group or individual based and operating entirely within the United States or its territories without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group.'' Groups and individuals inspired to commit terrorist acts are motivated by a range of personal, religious, political, or other ideological beliefs--there is no magic formula. Further, the complexity of adding social media as a new source of recruitment for violent extremists is complicating the efforts of law enforcement, domestic security and national defense. The line between lawfully protected speech and activity that may be a threat should be clearly defined by law. Taking care to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights means that our system of laws must acknowledge that reading, writing, or speaking of one's views or beliefs even when they are unpopular is not a crime. [[Page H1966]] Hate speech is not a crime--while an act of violence motivated by hate is. Violent extremist threats within the United States can come from a range of violent extremist groups and individuals, including Domestic Terrorists and Homegrown Violent Extremists (HVEs). The troubling violent nature of the attack at Mother Emanuel AME Church, its location in the South, on a night devoted to prayer services, by a young man still in his twenties awaken fears that many of us who represent majority minority congressional districts had hoped were receding with the passage of time. In the wake of the killings at Mother Emanuel in Charleston, several African American Churches have fallen victim to fires. Historically, African American churches are the center of religious, social, cultural and political life for the communities they serve. Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, members serving in this body were mindful of the history that we worked not to repeat. Today, we are still working to assure the public that appropriate checks must be made certain in how increased in government authority is controlled. The demographics of young persons' becoming involved in terrorist groups also appear to be changing. In many cases the persons implicated are younger than reported in the past and there appear to be more female youth joining the ranks of terrorist organizations. Additionally, more young supporters are coming from Western countries that are further removed from actual conflict areas. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas have recruited children as young as thirteen to be suicide bombers and children as young as eleven to smuggle explosives and weapons. During 2003, thirteen-year-old twin sisters who had been recruited by al-Qaeda linked groups were caught attempting to commit a suicide bombing against Western businesses and local government buildings in Morocco. Counter-recruitment and counter-radicalization initiatives should be tailored locally, and should engage members from across the community who are in a position to address specific underlying factors or identify potential radicalization indicators. Counter-recruitment and radicalization initiatives must evolve with the young audiences they are intended to reach, adapt along with the adversaries, incorporate new developments in technologies, and address changes within environments where young persons are susceptible. I encourage my colleagues to withdraw this bill and allow for it to be considered under an open rule or for the bill to be sent back to the committee for further consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Perry). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4820, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1961-H1966] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMBATING TERRORIST RECRUITMENT ACT OF 2016 Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4820) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to use the testimonials of former or estranged violent extremists or their associates in order to counter terrorist recruitment, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4820 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. DIRECTIVE. (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall incorporate, to the extent practicable, into Department of Homeland Security efforts to combat terrorist recruitment and communications the public testimonials of former violent extremists or their associates, including friends and family. Such efforts may include the following: (1) Counter-messaging of foreign terrorist organization communications and narratives. (2) Related community engagement and public education efforts. (b) Coordination.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, where appropriate, coordinate the efforts described in subsection (a) with the heads of other Federal departments and agencies, as appropriate, and, to the extent practicable, engage nongovernmental and international partners in the identification and use of testimonials described in such subsection. (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be construed to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to collect testimonials directly from former violent extremists or their associates, including friends and family. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous materials to the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016. I commend Mr. Fleischmann for offering this bipartisan counterterrorism bill at a time when we are in the highest terror threat environment since 9/11. We have more than 1,000 homegrown terror investigations in all 50 States, and we have arrested over 80 ISIS supporters in our country, many for plotting attacks. Terrorists are radicalizing our citizens online and across borders, which is why we need this legislation. It requires that the Secretary of Homeland Security use the testimonials of former extremists and defectors to help stop terrorist recruitment. President Obama himself--and I agree with him on this issue--argued last year: We need to lift up the voice of those who know the hypocrisy of groups like ISIS firsthand, including former extremists. He also noted: ``Former extremists . . . can be powerful messengers in debunking these terrorist ideologies.'' Our foreign partners are already using these types of testimonials overseas. So is our State Department. But we need to be doing this counter-messaging here at home. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in front of my committee last month: My priority has been focusing on communities that I believe are most vulnerable to the appeals from ISIS, al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups overseas who are actively targeting individuals in these communities . . . This is as important as any of our other homeland security missions. I commend Secretary Johnson for his words and his work, but we are not acting quickly enough. That is why this bill was one of the top recommendations of the bipartisan task force we created last year to look at this threat. In their final report, the Democratic and Republican Members who led the task force said America needed to launch a concerted effort to use the testimonials of former extremists to combat terrorist propaganda. This is from a Virginia defector. Just last month an ISIS defector from Virginia was picked up in Iraq. He said he wanted to send a message to the American people that life with ISIS was miserable and that the group did not represent Islam. These are the types of voices we need to amplify so as to keep others from making the same mistakes. Some have argued that this bill limits the DHS in allowing it only to counter-message groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, but that is simply false. In fact, at our markup, legislative counsel told the members: ``The current language in the bill is extremely broad-based. It does not place a limitation on anything.'' Although our bipartisan task force focused on foreign terrorist threats, the bill gives the Secretary the flexibility to address the full array of dangerous groups that threaten our people both here at home and abroad. I am proud to say that the majority of Republicans and Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee support this legislation. Terrorists are recruiting our citizens at the speed of broadband. So we can't move at the speed of bureaucracy. Today Congress has an opportunity to fight back. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in opposition to H.R. 4820, the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016. It is troubling that some of my colleagues have circulated misinformation about this bill. Let me set the record straight. The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly told my committee that H.R. 4820 is unnecessary insofar as the Department can already integrate public testimonials of former terrorists and violent extremists into its efforts to counter violent extremism and terrorism. In fact, yesterday I spoke with Secretary Johnson, and he reiterated that DHS has the authority it needs to carry out its countering violent extremism efforts and that this bill is unnecessary. I oppose H.R. 4820 today for the same reason I opposed it when it was considered earlier this month in committee. H.R. 4820 is nothing more than a message bill, a bill that sends the message to DHS to focus its counter-messaging efforts on foreign terrorist groups. [[Page H1962]] Domestic terror groups, like foreign terrorist organizations, recruit and spread propaganda through social media and online platforms. This bill ignores the fact that domestic terror groups, like foreign terrorist organizations, kill Americans. Since September 11, terrorists who have espoused their ideology of foreign terrorist organizations have been responsible for killing 45 innocent Americans on U.S. soil. During that same period, members of domestic terrorist organizations have murdered more than 48 Americans. If you ask law enforcement leaders across this country what keeps them up at night, they will likely say the prospect that there is a sovereign citizen group or militia plotting in their jurisdictions. Just last month the Atlanta police chief testified before my committee that he is deeply concerned about homegrown extremists and militia activity. His testimony echoes the results of a recent survey in which 74 percent of law enforcement identified anti-government extremism as one of the three terrorist threats in their jurisdictions. In the last 2 months, we have seen the development of domestic terrorists: an attack on police officers in Georgia by a self-appointed wizard of the Ku Klux Klan; the conviction by a Federal grand jury in Mississippi of two members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Mississippi for their participation in various criminal acts, including those of drug production, trafficking, kidnapping, and murder; the indictment of two members of a sovereign citizen group in Columbus, Ohio, for building a bomb that was modeled after the suicide vests that were used in the November Paris attack; a four-count indictment against a member of a Michigan sovereign citizen group for selling women and children into sexual slavery. Such abusive activities are chillingly similar to those of ISIL. In recognition of these facts, I, together with like-minded committee Democrats, made multiple proposals during and after the markup to fix the bill. We offered an amendment to define ``violent extremist'' to encompass not only those engaged in ideologically motivated international terrorism, but also in domestic terrorism. It was rejected. We offered an amendment to insert ``domestic terrorist organization.'' It was also rejected. Even after the markup, we made three more proposals to fix the bill. Each was rejected. By refusing to include any mention of domestic terrorist organizations, H.R. 4820 represents a significant departure from the holistic, comprehensive approach that has been espoused by the Obama administration to counter ideologically based violence. Since 2011, with the publication of the ``Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Extremism in the United States'' strategy by the White House, Federal efforts to prevent such terrorism have been guided by the recognition that violent extremists are inspired by a range of religious, political, or other ideological beliefs. The passage of H.R. 4820 would send the wrong message. As such, I urge a ``no'' vote. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Chattanooga, Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann), the sponsor and author of the bill. Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 4820, the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act. I wish to thank Chairman McCaul and the members of the Homeland Security Committee for all of their hard work on this bill. I will never forget the moment back in July--I was standing on this floor--when I was told about the shootings at two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the town in which I live and proudly represent. As many of you may remember, four marines and one sailor were killed in the attack while several others were wounded. Just this past December, following the FBI investigation, Director James Comey concluded that the shootings ``were motivated by foreign terrorist organization propaganda.'' Given the recent attacks in Chattanooga and San Bernardino, as well as in Paris and Brussels, we need to use every tool in the toolbox to combat this new brand of extremism. This bill implements one of the key recommendations made by the Homeland Security Committee's bipartisan task force, one that is specifically designed to counter terrorism and foreign fighter travel. This bill does not forbid DHS from countering all forms of extremism, but the bill does provide examples of how DHS can fulfill the requirement, such as counter-messaging foreign terrorist organizations, which are actively recruiting in our country at an alarming rate. This bipartisan legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to amplify the testimonials of former extremists and defectors to fight the propaganda and the recruitment of terrorist groups like ISIS. Foreign terrorists are using technology to radicalize Americans at a troubling pace, which continues to increase. More than 250 Americans have traveled or have attempted to travel to fight with jihadists in Syria and Iraq, and the FBI says there are open counterterrorism investigations in all 50 States, mostly ISIS related. Many of these individuals were pulled in by terrorist propaganda. {time} 1630 ISIS is luring Americans with empty and false promises that do not reflect the true reality on the ground in places like Syria and Iraq. The true reality centers on fear, suffering, and the murder of innocent people throughout the region and around the world. Several recent defectors from ISIS have admitted that joining the group was a terrible mistake. One young fighter said he found it very hard to live there and no longer believes the group represents their religion. We need to do all we can to amplify the messages from these disillusioned terrorists who have firsthand experience with the evil and hypocrisy of these extremist groups. The State Department and many of our key allies already utilize the testimony of those disaffected by the true reality of these terror groups, and the concept was also endorsed by the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Advisory Council last spring. Unfortunately, there may be partisan opposition to this bipartisan bill. The majority of the Homeland Security committee members, on both sides of the aisle, supported the bill in committee. I will say it again: this bill received a majority of votes from both sides of the aisle in committee. Let's not put partisanship ever ahead of our Nation's security. This is a commonsense measure to hinder those recruiting efforts of groups like ISIS with the testimony of those who have seen the evil of these groups firsthand. I urge the support of my colleagues. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman). Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4820, the so-called Combating Terrorist Recruitment Bill. H.R. 4820 omits any mention of domestic terrorist organizations, a significant departure from the holistic, comprehensive approach that is adopted by the administration to counter ideologically based violence. This bill isolates the enemy to be those who are Islamist, those who are foreign, and those who are being radicalized by foreigners. How does this bill address the threat of terror from those who are not just jaded jihadists, like this bill was initially titled, but, rather, a part of domestic militia or part of a rightwing, ultra- conservative, racist organization that wants to kill African Americans or other vulnerable populations? A recent study by the Police Executive Research Forum and the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security found that State and local law enforcement personnel are almost twice as concerned about rightwing and antigovernment terrorism as they are about the threat from al Qaeda, ISIS, and similar groups. The concerns of State and local law enforcement about domestic terrorism are well placed. Within the last year, we have seen a rightwing terrorist kill [[Page H1963]] nine people at Mother Emanuel in Charleston and an anti-abortion terrorist kill three people at the Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado. Since the attacks of 9/11, within the United States, domestic terrorists have killed 48 people, more than those killed by foreign terrorist-inspired attacks. Shouldn't we be concerned about those who have demonstrated the greatest threat to our homeland in the last 15 years? H.R. 4820 represents a marked departure from a national strategy to combat terrorism and that recognizes that individuals who promote and use violence against the U.S. are inspired by a range of religious, political, or other ideological beliefs. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Curbelo of Florida). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. This bill only serves to perpetuate the stigma associated with just one group of people who happen to practice Islam. It does not recognize a full range of terrorist threats to our homeland. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 4820. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), the original cosponsor of the bill and the chairman of the bipartisan task force. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for offering this legislation. Mr. Speaker, America continues to witness the largest convergence of radical Islamic threats in the history of our country. More than any threat before, ISIS demonstrated an ability to radicalize individuals throughout the world by utilizing the Internet. However, these individuals are met with the cold, hard reality that ISIS does not offer luxury, happiness, or peacefulness. On the contrary, these individuals are thrust onto the battlefield with little or no training and little or no regard for their lives. Some, when faced with the truth, try to turn back. Among those who recognize ISIS for the barbaric, destructive force that it is, some have actually dared to speak out against them, using their experience to dissuade others from risking their lives in order to wage war on innocent people. One of these individuals was mentioned by my colleague, Chairman Mike McCaul, and that individual grew up across the river from here in Alexandria, Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the efforts of our law enforcement and intelligence officials by supporting this bill. The Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016, of which I am a cosponsor, requires a dissemination of testimonials from ISIS defectors to help stop the radicalization of at-risk individuals. This bill comes from the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, of which I served as a Republican lead. Using these testimonials would fill a gap that our bipartisan task force identified in a bipartisan manner. I thank Chairman McCaul, who has led this effort. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I certainly don't question the motivations of the gentleman who has sponsored this bill. He is a good man, a good American, and loves his country, but I believe it is misdirected. I really do. In my hand, if you remember, there is a report from 2009, the beginning of the Obama administration. All that work was done in the previous administration on this report. The report is quite revealing. Anybody who is on Homeland Security should read it because it tells us that we need not only to carry out the oath of office, half of it, but we should defend the country against foreign intruders. Also, it says in our oath ``domestic'' as well. This report lays out very clearly what is going on in the United States of America in our backyards. It was squashed. I remember the day when a Democratic Secretary of the Homeland Security heard from me about it, that she should not have bent over because those on the other side wanted this report squashed. There have been articles written since that time, 2009, of how it was squashed. They didn't want the American people to read this. That is quite, quite a report. So I rise in opposition, Mr. Speaker, to H.R. 4820. No one loves this country more than the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson). I am not on that committee anymore, but no one respects it more than Bennie Thompson. Why is he opposed to this? Is he opposed to this because he doesn't love his country as much as the folks on the other side of the aisle? I don't think so. Does he oppose it because he didn't sponsor it? I don't think so. He opposes it because this excludes very specific things which we should not exclude. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New Jersey an additional 1 minute. Mr. PASCRELL. The House should not be picking and choosing what sources of terrorism the Department should focus on without taking into account all the facts. The House continues to ignore the threats posed by violent extremism, which are not limited to a single ideology. Eric Hoffer, in the book ``The True Believer,'' written many years ago, said that extremism is inspired by a range of reasons, including religious, political, or ideological beliefs. He says that these movements, regardless of the motive or end goal, simply need isolated individuals who are dispossessed in some way or other and need to feel part of something bigger than themselves. Why don't we really get at the sources of the people who want to kill our kids and want to damage our properties, whether they come from afar or whether they are grown right here? Homegrown. Homegrown. And we are ignoring it. The FBI reports that time and time again. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd). Mr. HURD of Texas. ``It's not a revolution or jihad. It's a slaughter. I was shocked by what I did.'' ``I found it very, very hard to live there. ISIS fighters don't represent the religion. I don't see them as good Muslims.'' Mr. Speaker, those are the words of Americans who traveled overseas to fight alongside ISIS. They left home believing they were headed toward a great adventure. They were promised glory and honor, but what they found was death and a perversion of the religion they believe in. These fighters were originally recruited to fight for ISIS through social media. Every day ISIS spreads their lies and propaganda, drawing in naive young Americans. They do this in dozens of different languages, reaching people across the world. Even while ISIS loses ground on the battlefield, they are working hard to make it up in the digital sphere. The Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act will allow us to take these powerful words of truth and use them to combat the lies that ISIS is spreading on social media. Some may say this is unnecessary. Some may say: Why aren't we already doing this? We aren't. That is why we need this piece of legislation. This bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to use the testimonials of former extremists and defectors as part of an ongoing effort to stop terrorist recruitment. These are individuals who have seen the brutality of terrorist groups firsthand and have rejected it. This bill is not limited to specific groups. Let me repeat that one more time: This bill is not limited to specific groups. It gives our counterterrorism professionals the flexibility needed to fight back against extremists as the threat environment and terrorist tactics change. It also requires DHS to coordinate these efforts with other agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and foreign partners so that we do this the right way, finding the best outlets for undermining terrorist propaganda. [[Page H1964]] The bipartisan Foreign Fighter Task Force I served on recommends that we use these credible voices to fight against ISIS' online efforts. The nonpartisan Homeland Security Advisory Council has urged DHS to use the testimonials of former extremists in our counternarrative efforts. Our foreign partners are already using these tactics and finding them effective. Our young people are being targeted. We have the tools to help protect them. These tools can stop others in our hometowns from making a terrible mistake. We need to get in the online fight, but time is not on our side. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act. Having spent 9\1/2\ years as an undercover officer chasing terrorists across the world, there is no such thing as a silver bullet. We have to do this piecemeal, and this bill is one step going in that direction. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the ranking member on the House Transportation Committee. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as one who served from the creation of the Homeland Security Committee until just a couple of years ago. I am concerned about what I am hearing here today on the floor, and I am surprised. Perhaps we should insert the word ``some,'' combating some terrorist recruitment in 2016. Now, the chairman said that DHS certainly has the flexibility to address domestic terrorism. Well, that is true. But why leave out explicit mention of domestic terrorism? {time} 1645 Are you afraid of offending some rightwing nuts out there? What is the deal? Seriously, I just went through this in Oregon. I have been on the Department of Justice and the FBI for about 2 years: Go get Cliven Bundy, get his cattle off the land, put the guy in jail. They didn't do it. And what happened? He taught his kids the way it was done. You show the government a gun, and they will run away, and you keep doing what you want, and you can deny that the Federal Government has the right to own any public lands in this country and try and take them over for private individuals. Now, this is a serious threat. The Murrah building, there were no foreign terrorists involved, 168 dead, hundreds injured, and we can't explicitly put into this bill all terrorism, including domestic terrorism. I really fear that some are worried that some of these rightwing extremist groups out there might be offended if we were to say that they are a threat to our Nation. Well, they are very much a threat, and this bill omitting that should have this bill denied passage on this floor and bring it back in a comprehensive way next week. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan). Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4820, the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act authored by Mr. Fleischmann. This bill is one step in implementing the recommendations of the Committee on Homeland Security's Foreign Fighter Task Force. This bipartisan team was charged with studying how our government can combat Western citizens who become radicalized and take up arms with terrorists. The President, senior national security officials, industry leaders, and experts have all expressed support for this concept. While all self-radicalized terrorists deserve the consequences of their behavior, some realize just how profound they were mistaken after seeing the reality of life under ISIS. They sometimes recant and tell the truth about the atrocities that they have witnessed or committed. That is valuable information. What this bill does is common sense. It directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to use testimony from these individuals as part of our efforts to combat violent extremists. President Obama himself stated that we need to ``lift up the voices'' of former extremists in order to expose the hypocrisy of ISIS, but this bill does not limit the Department's ability to countermeasure terrorist groups that threaten us no matter where they are located. As we speak, ISIS is using social media and the Internet to radicalize young Americans who are vulnerable to a message of inclusion in a grand cause, no matter how sinister. Before they make a mistake that could cause them and others their lives, let's take every opportunity to counter ISIS' poisonous narrative. To hear from others like them who wanted to believe in ISIS and found the truth too late is a tactic we should utilize. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, which received bipartisan support in committee. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and I am prepared to close. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry). Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee for offering this bill, as well as Chairman McCaul for bringing it to the floor. When the terrorists attacked in San Bernardino, many Americans said: What are we doing? When you find out that these folks are trafficking on the Internet and messaging, they say: Where is our FBI? Where are the services protecting us, and why aren't they doing everything they can? This is one thing they can do is offer testimonials from people who have been there who can give other people who might be interested in joining the truth. Yet there are some folks here who don't want to do that. They are interested in misrepresenting this bill. I want to remind everybody that this bill is the result of a bipartisan task force, a bipartisan task force, Member-led, that said we need to do exactly this, and unanimously move this forward to the full committee. They say it is unnecessary. Well, if it is unnecessary, why isn't Homeland Security doing this already? Why not? How long are they going to wait? They say that they offered amendments. Really? They offered amendments? They couldn't be bothered to answer the chairman's call when he said: Hey, can you collaborate with us on this so we have a good bill that everybody is involved in. They waited until the day of the markup, and then came in with a bunch of amendments and concerns. It was apparent that all they wanted to do was slow the process down and, as a matter of fact, move the process to some other date. How long are we going to wait? Do you want to ask the relatives of those who are killed by these people how long they want to wait? How about the next ones? Now, some on the other side have picked this up as this is a politically motivated agenda. I say some because not all. As a matter of fact, many on the other side voted to move this bill right to the floor where it is now. I don't understand why they would want to have America be less safe. I don't understand, Mr. Speaker. We spent 4 hours--4 hours--going over a two-page bill. Two pages. We entertained what they wanted to change, and we did make some changes, but it was apparent that all they wanted to really do was stall and stall and move this process forward down the line and never get to it. Mr. Speaker, we don't have any choice. We have to move forward now. Those in opposition are simply willfully refusing to see what all America sees. We need to address this threat immediately. It is a two- page bill, and it doesn't deny Homeland Security from doing anything that it has already been doing. As a matter of fact, these folks on the other side demanded at that markup--they demanded--that we say that Homeland Security must do this. And the chairman said: Okay, if you want to demand that they do it, we will demand that they do it. Mr. Speaker, I think we ought to make America safe and pass this bill. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, from Boston to Charleston, we have seen individuals operating within our communities and living among us plot to cause mass harm in the name of a violent extremist and hateful ideology. Today much has been made of the fact that the FBI has open investigations of ISIL-inspired activity in all 50 States. Far less [[Page H1965]] attention has been given to the number of open investigations of anti- government and militia groups, a number that grew by one-third in 2015 alone. We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the threats posed by any terrorist group or organization, as the bill before us today would do. Therefore, it is imperative that DHS use testimonials from violent extremists involved in all forms of violent extremism. Public testimonials can be a powerful tool to reach individuals who otherwise might be susceptible to terrorist propaganda. Given the diversity in the threat landscape that we face, it just makes sense that any such effort should be comprehensive. Unfortunately, the bill's sponsors have decided that this bill should turn away from the comprehensive approach. Mr. Speaker, again, let me indicate that the only real issue before us is the domestic aspect of terrorism. Domestic terrorist organizations have demonstrated time and time again, they have killed more Americans here on our soil than foreign terrorists have. The reason we are in opposition is we don't recognize that in this legislation. Our effort in markup, as well as here on the floor, is to make sure that all of the bad people get recognized, those international and foreign, but also those who are domestic. Some of us have lived in parts of the country where domestic terrorism was a way of life for a lot of us, and because of that, we are very passionate on that subject. The Charleston situation was very unfortunate. That was an act of domestic terrorism. There is no question about it. So why wouldn't we want to add those kind of extremist activities in this legislation so we can cover everyone? That is really the opposition that we have had. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 4820. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, Paris, Brussels, Chattanooga, San Bernardino. How many more? Mr. Speaker, it is time to act, and act today on this important legislation that is bipartisan. It is important to point out--I know the ranking member has good intentions, but our bill allows DHS to combat terrorist recruitment by all dangerous organizations, as was brought out at the markup. The President's Homeland Security adviser, Lisa Monaco, said: ``Our efforts will be the most effective when they focus on amplifying authentic voices,'' such as former violent extremists. These voices can convince others from going down the path to violence. The President's national security adviser, Susan Rice, added that they are already amplifying the voices of ISIL defectors overseas. And she explains that ``these voices are eroding ISIL's appeal.'' This countermessaging works, and it has worked for the State Department, but we are not doing it at home. We need to do it here at home and not just overseas. That is why I urge strong support for this. I don't understand after it being the product of a bipartisan task force with bipartisan support out of the committee, the very week that the Brussels attack occurred, we marked up this bill. Mr. Speaker, it is time to act. I urge passage of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 4820, the ``Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016,'' because regrettably the bill was not improved as I had hoped and expected between the Committee markup and, floor consideration. Specifically, Section 2 of H.R. 4820, directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, inter alia, to employ ``Counter-messaging of foreign terrorist organization communications and narratives.'' However, the bill is silent on the issue of domestic terrorists and the threat they pose to the safety and security of Americans. This was a point raised by the minority members during the markup, but an agreement could not be reached to include the words ``and domestic terrorist'' in the bill. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I appreciate the concerns the bill is intended to address but in my view the bill's scope is too limited in view of the number and frequency of violent domestic extremist attacks such as the one occurring in the evening of June 17, 2015 at the historic Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Combating violent extremism is too important to become the subject of partisan political disputes. Instead, we should work together to find common ground that reconciles the competing interests of collective security and individual liberties. We must not focus on one religion as being a threat--this would be wrong and counterproductive. Mr. Speaker, there have been other attacks by foreign and domestic violent extremists. The Fort Hood Texas attack committed by Major Nidal Malik Hasan, who opened fire and killed 13 U.S. military personnel. The Boston Marathon attackers were two Chechen brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev who carried out a bombing that took 3 lives and injured 264 others. Later, the brothers killed university police officer Sean A. Collier. On December 2, 2015, 14 people were killed and 22 were seriously injured in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, which consisted of a mass shooting and an attempted bombing. The perpetrators, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, a married couple living in the city of Redlands, who the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health training event and holiday party, of about 80 employees. This threat of attack by foreign terrorists on American soil is real and substantial and requires vigilance by the Administration and this Congress. However, threats of domestic terrorist attacks are also real. Mr. Speaker, we cannot be unmindful of the fact that since September 2001, there have been 250 deaths at the hands of home grown violent extremists as opposed by 50 by foreign terrorists. The seminal act of homegrown domestic terror occurred in 1995, when the domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh detonated the truck bomb that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 persons and injured over 680 people. At the time, it is the largest loss of American lives at the hands of a domestic terror group since the Civil War. Today, the challenge is countering the messages of violent extremism no matter the source and not to fall for thinking that one type of violent extremism is less of a threat than another type of violent extremism. Radical and extremist groups, both domestic and international, systematically prey upon the vulnerabilities of young persons by offering inducements such as financial assistance, familial-like bonds, or the promise of an exciting and heroic life. In some cases, youth have been forcibly recruited or tricked into participating in terrorist activities, including suicide bombings. The heinous attack in Mother Emmanuel Church was a defining moment in our nation's history for many reasons, but the final chapter will be written by those who are charged with keeping our nation and its people safe while preserving the way of life that terrorist seek to change. One of the enduring challenges for members of the Homeland Security Committee is how we guide the work of the Department of Homeland Security. I hosted DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson in Houston for two days of discussions, and tours that were insightful and probing on a range of regional and national homeland security issues. The issue of violent extremism is one of several efforts that the Department of Homeland Security has prioritized and begun efforts to address both the international threat and the domestic threats. DHS defines ``Domestic Terrorism'' as: ``Any act of violence that is dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources committed by a group or individual based and operating entirely within the United States or its territories without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group.'' Groups and individuals inspired to commit terrorist acts are motivated by a range of personal, religious, political, or other ideological beliefs--there is no magic formula. Further, the complexity of adding social media as a new source of recruitment for violent extremists is complicating the efforts of law enforcement, domestic security and national defense. The line between lawfully protected speech and activity that may be a threat should be clearly defined by law. Taking care to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights means that our system of laws must acknowledge that reading, writing, or speaking of one's views or beliefs even when they are unpopular is not a crime. [[Page H1966]] Hate speech is not a crime--while an act of violence motivated by hate is. Violent extremist threats within the United States can come from a range of violent extremist groups and individuals, including Domestic Terrorists and Homegrown Violent Extremists (HVEs). The troubling violent nature of the attack at Mother Emanuel AME Church, its location in the South, on a night devoted to prayer services, by a young man still in his twenties awaken fears that many of us who represent majority minority congressional districts had hoped were receding with the passage of time. In the wake of the killings at Mother Emanuel in Charleston, several African American Churches have fallen victim to fires. Historically, African American churches are the center of religious, social, cultural and political life for the communities they serve. Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, members serving in this body were mindful of the history that we worked not to repeat. Today, we are still working to assure the public that appropriate checks must be made certain in how increased in government authority is controlled. The demographics of young persons' becoming involved in terrorist groups also appear to be changing. In many cases the persons implicated are younger than reported in the past and there appear to be more female youth joining the ranks of terrorist organizations. Additionally, more young supporters are coming from Western countries that are further removed from actual conflict areas. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas have recruited children as young as thirteen to be suicide bombers and children as young as eleven to smuggle explosives and weapons. During 2003, thirteen-year-old twin sisters who had been recruited by al-Qaeda linked groups were caught attempting to commit a suicide bombing against Western businesses and local government buildings in Morocco. Counter-recruitment and counter-radicalization initiatives should be tailored locally, and should engage members from across the community who are in a position to address specific underlying factors or identify potential radicalization indicators. Counter-recruitment and radicalization initiatives must evolve with the young audiences they are intended to reach, adapt along with the adversaries, incorporate new developments in technologies, and address changes within environments where young persons are susceptible. I encourage my colleagues to withdraw this bill and allow for it to be considered under an open rule or for the bill to be sent back to the committee for further consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Perry). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4820, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1961-H1966] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMBATING TERRORIST RECRUITMENT ACT OF 2016 Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4820) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to use the testimonials of former or estranged violent extremists or their associates in order to counter terrorist recruitment, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4820 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. DIRECTIVE. (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall incorporate, to the extent practicable, into Department of Homeland Security efforts to combat terrorist recruitment and communications the public testimonials of former violent extremists or their associates, including friends and family. Such efforts may include the following: (1) Counter-messaging of foreign terrorist organization communications and narratives. (2) Related community engagement and public education efforts. (b) Coordination.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, where appropriate, coordinate the efforts described in subsection (a) with the heads of other Federal departments and agencies, as appropriate, and, to the extent practicable, engage nongovernmental and international partners in the identification and use of testimonials described in such subsection. (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be construed to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to collect testimonials directly from former violent extremists or their associates, including friends and family. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous materials to the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016. I commend Mr. Fleischmann for offering this bipartisan counterterrorism bill at a time when we are in the highest terror threat environment since 9/11. We have more than 1,000 homegrown terror investigations in all 50 States, and we have arrested over 80 ISIS supporters in our country, many for plotting attacks. Terrorists are radicalizing our citizens online and across borders, which is why we need this legislation. It requires that the Secretary of Homeland Security use the testimonials of former extremists and defectors to help stop terrorist recruitment. President Obama himself--and I agree with him on this issue--argued last year: We need to lift up the voice of those who know the hypocrisy of groups like ISIS firsthand, including former extremists. He also noted: ``Former extremists . . . can be powerful messengers in debunking these terrorist ideologies.'' Our foreign partners are already using these types of testimonials overseas. So is our State Department. But we need to be doing this counter-messaging here at home. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in front of my committee last month: My priority has been focusing on communities that I believe are most vulnerable to the appeals from ISIS, al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups overseas who are actively targeting individuals in these communities . . . This is as important as any of our other homeland security missions. I commend Secretary Johnson for his words and his work, but we are not acting quickly enough. That is why this bill was one of the top recommendations of the bipartisan task force we created last year to look at this threat. In their final report, the Democratic and Republican Members who led the task force said America needed to launch a concerted effort to use the testimonials of former extremists to combat terrorist propaganda. This is from a Virginia defector. Just last month an ISIS defector from Virginia was picked up in Iraq. He said he wanted to send a message to the American people that life with ISIS was miserable and that the group did not represent Islam. These are the types of voices we need to amplify so as to keep others from making the same mistakes. Some have argued that this bill limits the DHS in allowing it only to counter-message groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, but that is simply false. In fact, at our markup, legislative counsel told the members: ``The current language in the bill is extremely broad-based. It does not place a limitation on anything.'' Although our bipartisan task force focused on foreign terrorist threats, the bill gives the Secretary the flexibility to address the full array of dangerous groups that threaten our people both here at home and abroad. I am proud to say that the majority of Republicans and Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee support this legislation. Terrorists are recruiting our citizens at the speed of broadband. So we can't move at the speed of bureaucracy. Today Congress has an opportunity to fight back. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in opposition to H.R. 4820, the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016. It is troubling that some of my colleagues have circulated misinformation about this bill. Let me set the record straight. The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly told my committee that H.R. 4820 is unnecessary insofar as the Department can already integrate public testimonials of former terrorists and violent extremists into its efforts to counter violent extremism and terrorism. In fact, yesterday I spoke with Secretary Johnson, and he reiterated that DHS has the authority it needs to carry out its countering violent extremism efforts and that this bill is unnecessary. I oppose H.R. 4820 today for the same reason I opposed it when it was considered earlier this month in committee. H.R. 4820 is nothing more than a message bill, a bill that sends the message to DHS to focus its counter-messaging efforts on foreign terrorist groups. [[Page H1962]] Domestic terror groups, like foreign terrorist organizations, recruit and spread propaganda through social media and online platforms. This bill ignores the fact that domestic terror groups, like foreign terrorist organizations, kill Americans. Since September 11, terrorists who have espoused their ideology of foreign terrorist organizations have been responsible for killing 45 innocent Americans on U.S. soil. During that same period, members of domestic terrorist organizations have murdered more than 48 Americans. If you ask law enforcement leaders across this country what keeps them up at night, they will likely say the prospect that there is a sovereign citizen group or militia plotting in their jurisdictions. Just last month the Atlanta police chief testified before my committee that he is deeply concerned about homegrown extremists and militia activity. His testimony echoes the results of a recent survey in which 74 percent of law enforcement identified anti-government extremism as one of the three terrorist threats in their jurisdictions. In the last 2 months, we have seen the development of domestic terrorists: an attack on police officers in Georgia by a self-appointed wizard of the Ku Klux Klan; the conviction by a Federal grand jury in Mississippi of two members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Mississippi for their participation in various criminal acts, including those of drug production, trafficking, kidnapping, and murder; the indictment of two members of a sovereign citizen group in Columbus, Ohio, for building a bomb that was modeled after the suicide vests that were used in the November Paris attack; a four-count indictment against a member of a Michigan sovereign citizen group for selling women and children into sexual slavery. Such abusive activities are chillingly similar to those of ISIL. In recognition of these facts, I, together with like-minded committee Democrats, made multiple proposals during and after the markup to fix the bill. We offered an amendment to define ``violent extremist'' to encompass not only those engaged in ideologically motivated international terrorism, but also in domestic terrorism. It was rejected. We offered an amendment to insert ``domestic terrorist organization.'' It was also rejected. Even after the markup, we made three more proposals to fix the bill. Each was rejected. By refusing to include any mention of domestic terrorist organizations, H.R. 4820 represents a significant departure from the holistic, comprehensive approach that has been espoused by the Obama administration to counter ideologically based violence. Since 2011, with the publication of the ``Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Extremism in the United States'' strategy by the White House, Federal efforts to prevent such terrorism have been guided by the recognition that violent extremists are inspired by a range of religious, political, or other ideological beliefs. The passage of H.R. 4820 would send the wrong message. As such, I urge a ``no'' vote. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Chattanooga, Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann), the sponsor and author of the bill. Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 4820, the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act. I wish to thank Chairman McCaul and the members of the Homeland Security Committee for all of their hard work on this bill. I will never forget the moment back in July--I was standing on this floor--when I was told about the shootings at two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the town in which I live and proudly represent. As many of you may remember, four marines and one sailor were killed in the attack while several others were wounded. Just this past December, following the FBI investigation, Director James Comey concluded that the shootings ``were motivated by foreign terrorist organization propaganda.'' Given the recent attacks in Chattanooga and San Bernardino, as well as in Paris and Brussels, we need to use every tool in the toolbox to combat this new brand of extremism. This bill implements one of the key recommendations made by the Homeland Security Committee's bipartisan task force, one that is specifically designed to counter terrorism and foreign fighter travel. This bill does not forbid DHS from countering all forms of extremism, but the bill does provide examples of how DHS can fulfill the requirement, such as counter-messaging foreign terrorist organizations, which are actively recruiting in our country at an alarming rate. This bipartisan legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to amplify the testimonials of former extremists and defectors to fight the propaganda and the recruitment of terrorist groups like ISIS. Foreign terrorists are using technology to radicalize Americans at a troubling pace, which continues to increase. More than 250 Americans have traveled or have attempted to travel to fight with jihadists in Syria and Iraq, and the FBI says there are open counterterrorism investigations in all 50 States, mostly ISIS related. Many of these individuals were pulled in by terrorist propaganda. {time} 1630 ISIS is luring Americans with empty and false promises that do not reflect the true reality on the ground in places like Syria and Iraq. The true reality centers on fear, suffering, and the murder of innocent people throughout the region and around the world. Several recent defectors from ISIS have admitted that joining the group was a terrible mistake. One young fighter said he found it very hard to live there and no longer believes the group represents their religion. We need to do all we can to amplify the messages from these disillusioned terrorists who have firsthand experience with the evil and hypocrisy of these extremist groups. The State Department and many of our key allies already utilize the testimony of those disaffected by the true reality of these terror groups, and the concept was also endorsed by the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Advisory Council last spring. Unfortunately, there may be partisan opposition to this bipartisan bill. The majority of the Homeland Security committee members, on both sides of the aisle, supported the bill in committee. I will say it again: this bill received a majority of votes from both sides of the aisle in committee. Let's not put partisanship ever ahead of our Nation's security. This is a commonsense measure to hinder those recruiting efforts of groups like ISIS with the testimony of those who have seen the evil of these groups firsthand. I urge the support of my colleagues. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman). Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4820, the so-called Combating Terrorist Recruitment Bill. H.R. 4820 omits any mention of domestic terrorist organizations, a significant departure from the holistic, comprehensive approach that is adopted by the administration to counter ideologically based violence. This bill isolates the enemy to be those who are Islamist, those who are foreign, and those who are being radicalized by foreigners. How does this bill address the threat of terror from those who are not just jaded jihadists, like this bill was initially titled, but, rather, a part of domestic militia or part of a rightwing, ultra- conservative, racist organization that wants to kill African Americans or other vulnerable populations? A recent study by the Police Executive Research Forum and the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security found that State and local law enforcement personnel are almost twice as concerned about rightwing and antigovernment terrorism as they are about the threat from al Qaeda, ISIS, and similar groups. The concerns of State and local law enforcement about domestic terrorism are well placed. Within the last year, we have seen a rightwing terrorist kill [[Page H1963]] nine people at Mother Emanuel in Charleston and an anti-abortion terrorist kill three people at the Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado. Since the attacks of 9/11, within the United States, domestic terrorists have killed 48 people, more than those killed by foreign terrorist-inspired attacks. Shouldn't we be concerned about those who have demonstrated the greatest threat to our homeland in the last 15 years? H.R. 4820 represents a marked departure from a national strategy to combat terrorism and that recognizes that individuals who promote and use violence against the U.S. are inspired by a range of religious, political, or other ideological beliefs. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Curbelo of Florida). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. This bill only serves to perpetuate the stigma associated with just one group of people who happen to practice Islam. It does not recognize a full range of terrorist threats to our homeland. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 4820. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), the original cosponsor of the bill and the chairman of the bipartisan task force. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for offering this legislation. Mr. Speaker, America continues to witness the largest convergence of radical Islamic threats in the history of our country. More than any threat before, ISIS demonstrated an ability to radicalize individuals throughout the world by utilizing the Internet. However, these individuals are met with the cold, hard reality that ISIS does not offer luxury, happiness, or peacefulness. On the contrary, these individuals are thrust onto the battlefield with little or no training and little or no regard for their lives. Some, when faced with the truth, try to turn back. Among those who recognize ISIS for the barbaric, destructive force that it is, some have actually dared to speak out against them, using their experience to dissuade others from risking their lives in order to wage war on innocent people. One of these individuals was mentioned by my colleague, Chairman Mike McCaul, and that individual grew up across the river from here in Alexandria, Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the efforts of our law enforcement and intelligence officials by supporting this bill. The Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016, of which I am a cosponsor, requires a dissemination of testimonials from ISIS defectors to help stop the radicalization of at-risk individuals. This bill comes from the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, of which I served as a Republican lead. Using these testimonials would fill a gap that our bipartisan task force identified in a bipartisan manner. I thank Chairman McCaul, who has led this effort. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I certainly don't question the motivations of the gentleman who has sponsored this bill. He is a good man, a good American, and loves his country, but I believe it is misdirected. I really do. In my hand, if you remember, there is a report from 2009, the beginning of the Obama administration. All that work was done in the previous administration on this report. The report is quite revealing. Anybody who is on Homeland Security should read it because it tells us that we need not only to carry out the oath of office, half of it, but we should defend the country against foreign intruders. Also, it says in our oath ``domestic'' as well. This report lays out very clearly what is going on in the United States of America in our backyards. It was squashed. I remember the day when a Democratic Secretary of the Homeland Security heard from me about it, that she should not have bent over because those on the other side wanted this report squashed. There have been articles written since that time, 2009, of how it was squashed. They didn't want the American people to read this. That is quite, quite a report. So I rise in opposition, Mr. Speaker, to H.R. 4820. No one loves this country more than the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson). I am not on that committee anymore, but no one respects it more than Bennie Thompson. Why is he opposed to this? Is he opposed to this because he doesn't love his country as much as the folks on the other side of the aisle? I don't think so. Does he oppose it because he didn't sponsor it? I don't think so. He opposes it because this excludes very specific things which we should not exclude. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New Jersey an additional 1 minute. Mr. PASCRELL. The House should not be picking and choosing what sources of terrorism the Department should focus on without taking into account all the facts. The House continues to ignore the threats posed by violent extremism, which are not limited to a single ideology. Eric Hoffer, in the book ``The True Believer,'' written many years ago, said that extremism is inspired by a range of reasons, including religious, political, or ideological beliefs. He says that these movements, regardless of the motive or end goal, simply need isolated individuals who are dispossessed in some way or other and need to feel part of something bigger than themselves. Why don't we really get at the sources of the people who want to kill our kids and want to damage our properties, whether they come from afar or whether they are grown right here? Homegrown. Homegrown. And we are ignoring it. The FBI reports that time and time again. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd). Mr. HURD of Texas. ``It's not a revolution or jihad. It's a slaughter. I was shocked by what I did.'' ``I found it very, very hard to live there. ISIS fighters don't represent the religion. I don't see them as good Muslims.'' Mr. Speaker, those are the words of Americans who traveled overseas to fight alongside ISIS. They left home believing they were headed toward a great adventure. They were promised glory and honor, but what they found was death and a perversion of the religion they believe in. These fighters were originally recruited to fight for ISIS through social media. Every day ISIS spreads their lies and propaganda, drawing in naive young Americans. They do this in dozens of different languages, reaching people across the world. Even while ISIS loses ground on the battlefield, they are working hard to make it up in the digital sphere. The Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act will allow us to take these powerful words of truth and use them to combat the lies that ISIS is spreading on social media. Some may say this is unnecessary. Some may say: Why aren't we already doing this? We aren't. That is why we need this piece of legislation. This bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to use the testimonials of former extremists and defectors as part of an ongoing effort to stop terrorist recruitment. These are individuals who have seen the brutality of terrorist groups firsthand and have rejected it. This bill is not limited to specific groups. Let me repeat that one more time: This bill is not limited to specific groups. It gives our counterterrorism professionals the flexibility needed to fight back against extremists as the threat environment and terrorist tactics change. It also requires DHS to coordinate these efforts with other agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and foreign partners so that we do this the right way, finding the best outlets for undermining terrorist propaganda. [[Page H1964]] The bipartisan Foreign Fighter Task Force I served on recommends that we use these credible voices to fight against ISIS' online efforts. The nonpartisan Homeland Security Advisory Council has urged DHS to use the testimonials of former extremists in our counternarrative efforts. Our foreign partners are already using these tactics and finding them effective. Our young people are being targeted. We have the tools to help protect them. These tools can stop others in our hometowns from making a terrible mistake. We need to get in the online fight, but time is not on our side. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act. Having spent 9\1/2\ years as an undercover officer chasing terrorists across the world, there is no such thing as a silver bullet. We have to do this piecemeal, and this bill is one step going in that direction. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the ranking member on the House Transportation Committee. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as one who served from the creation of the Homeland Security Committee until just a couple of years ago. I am concerned about what I am hearing here today on the floor, and I am surprised. Perhaps we should insert the word ``some,'' combating some terrorist recruitment in 2016. Now, the chairman said that DHS certainly has the flexibility to address domestic terrorism. Well, that is true. But why leave out explicit mention of domestic terrorism? {time} 1645 Are you afraid of offending some rightwing nuts out there? What is the deal? Seriously, I just went through this in Oregon. I have been on the Department of Justice and the FBI for about 2 years: Go get Cliven Bundy, get his cattle off the land, put the guy in jail. They didn't do it. And what happened? He taught his kids the way it was done. You show the government a gun, and they will run away, and you keep doing what you want, and you can deny that the Federal Government has the right to own any public lands in this country and try and take them over for private individuals. Now, this is a serious threat. The Murrah building, there were no foreign terrorists involved, 168 dead, hundreds injured, and we can't explicitly put into this bill all terrorism, including domestic terrorism. I really fear that some are worried that some of these rightwing extremist groups out there might be offended if we were to say that they are a threat to our Nation. Well, they are very much a threat, and this bill omitting that should have this bill denied passage on this floor and bring it back in a comprehensive way next week. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan). Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4820, the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act authored by Mr. Fleischmann. This bill is one step in implementing the recommendations of the Committee on Homeland Security's Foreign Fighter Task Force. This bipartisan team was charged with studying how our government can combat Western citizens who become radicalized and take up arms with terrorists. The President, senior national security officials, industry leaders, and experts have all expressed support for this concept. While all self-radicalized terrorists deserve the consequences of their behavior, some realize just how profound they were mistaken after seeing the reality of life under ISIS. They sometimes recant and tell the truth about the atrocities that they have witnessed or committed. That is valuable information. What this bill does is common sense. It directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to use testimony from these individuals as part of our efforts to combat violent extremists. President Obama himself stated that we need to ``lift up the voices'' of former extremists in order to expose the hypocrisy of ISIS, but this bill does not limit the Department's ability to countermeasure terrorist groups that threaten us no matter where they are located. As we speak, ISIS is using social media and the Internet to radicalize young Americans who are vulnerable to a message of inclusion in a grand cause, no matter how sinister. Before they make a mistake that could cause them and others their lives, let's take every opportunity to counter ISIS' poisonous narrative. To hear from others like them who wanted to believe in ISIS and found the truth too late is a tactic we should utilize. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, which received bipartisan support in committee. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and I am prepared to close. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry). Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee for offering this bill, as well as Chairman McCaul for bringing it to the floor. When the terrorists attacked in San Bernardino, many Americans said: What are we doing? When you find out that these folks are trafficking on the Internet and messaging, they say: Where is our FBI? Where are the services protecting us, and why aren't they doing everything they can? This is one thing they can do is offer testimonials from people who have been there who can give other people who might be interested in joining the truth. Yet there are some folks here who don't want to do that. They are interested in misrepresenting this bill. I want to remind everybody that this bill is the result of a bipartisan task force, a bipartisan task force, Member-led, that said we need to do exactly this, and unanimously move this forward to the full committee. They say it is unnecessary. Well, if it is unnecessary, why isn't Homeland Security doing this already? Why not? How long are they going to wait? They say that they offered amendments. Really? They offered amendments? They couldn't be bothered to answer the chairman's call when he said: Hey, can you collaborate with us on this so we have a good bill that everybody is involved in. They waited until the day of the markup, and then came in with a bunch of amendments and concerns. It was apparent that all they wanted to do was slow the process down and, as a matter of fact, move the process to some other date. How long are we going to wait? Do you want to ask the relatives of those who are killed by these people how long they want to wait? How about the next ones? Now, some on the other side have picked this up as this is a politically motivated agenda. I say some because not all. As a matter of fact, many on the other side voted to move this bill right to the floor where it is now. I don't understand why they would want to have America be less safe. I don't understand, Mr. Speaker. We spent 4 hours--4 hours--going over a two-page bill. Two pages. We entertained what they wanted to change, and we did make some changes, but it was apparent that all they wanted to really do was stall and stall and move this process forward down the line and never get to it. Mr. Speaker, we don't have any choice. We have to move forward now. Those in opposition are simply willfully refusing to see what all America sees. We need to address this threat immediately. It is a two- page bill, and it doesn't deny Homeland Security from doing anything that it has already been doing. As a matter of fact, these folks on the other side demanded at that markup--they demanded--that we say that Homeland Security must do this. And the chairman said: Okay, if you want to demand that they do it, we will demand that they do it. Mr. Speaker, I think we ought to make America safe and pass this bill. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, from Boston to Charleston, we have seen individuals operating within our communities and living among us plot to cause mass harm in the name of a violent extremist and hateful ideology. Today much has been made of the fact that the FBI has open investigations of ISIL-inspired activity in all 50 States. Far less [[Page H1965]] attention has been given to the number of open investigations of anti- government and militia groups, a number that grew by one-third in 2015 alone. We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the threats posed by any terrorist group or organization, as the bill before us today would do. Therefore, it is imperative that DHS use testimonials from violent extremists involved in all forms of violent extremism. Public testimonials can be a powerful tool to reach individuals who otherwise might be susceptible to terrorist propaganda. Given the diversity in the threat landscape that we face, it just makes sense that any such effort should be comprehensive. Unfortunately, the bill's sponsors have decided that this bill should turn away from the comprehensive approach. Mr. Speaker, again, let me indicate that the only real issue before us is the domestic aspect of terrorism. Domestic terrorist organizations have demonstrated time and time again, they have killed more Americans here on our soil than foreign terrorists have. The reason we are in opposition is we don't recognize that in this legislation. Our effort in markup, as well as here on the floor, is to make sure that all of the bad people get recognized, those international and foreign, but also those who are domestic. Some of us have lived in parts of the country where domestic terrorism was a way of life for a lot of us, and because of that, we are very passionate on that subject. The Charleston situation was very unfortunate. That was an act of domestic terrorism. There is no question about it. So why wouldn't we want to add those kind of extremist activities in this legislation so we can cover everyone? That is really the opposition that we have had. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 4820. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, Paris, Brussels, Chattanooga, San Bernardino. How many more? Mr. Speaker, it is time to act, and act today on this important legislation that is bipartisan. It is important to point out--I know the ranking member has good intentions, but our bill allows DHS to combat terrorist recruitment by all dangerous organizations, as was brought out at the markup. The President's Homeland Security adviser, Lisa Monaco, said: ``Our efforts will be the most effective when they focus on amplifying authentic voices,'' such as former violent extremists. These voices can convince others from going down the path to violence. The President's national security adviser, Susan Rice, added that they are already amplifying the voices of ISIL defectors overseas. And she explains that ``these voices are eroding ISIL's appeal.'' This countermessaging works, and it has worked for the State Department, but we are not doing it at home. We need to do it here at home and not just overseas. That is why I urge strong support for this. I don't understand after it being the product of a bipartisan task force with bipartisan support out of the committee, the very week that the Brussels attack occurred, we marked up this bill. Mr. Speaker, it is time to act. I urge passage of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 4820, the ``Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016,'' because regrettably the bill was not improved as I had hoped and expected between the Committee markup and, floor consideration. Specifically, Section 2 of H.R. 4820, directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, inter alia, to employ ``Counter-messaging of foreign terrorist organization communications and narratives.'' However, the bill is silent on the issue of domestic terrorists and the threat they pose to the safety and security of Americans. This was a point raised by the minority members during the markup, but an agreement could not be reached to include the words ``and domestic terrorist'' in the bill. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I appreciate the concerns the bill is intended to address but in my view the bill's scope is too limited in view of the number and frequency of violent domestic extremist attacks such as the one occurring in the evening of June 17, 2015 at the historic Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Combating violent extremism is too important to become the subject of partisan political disputes. Instead, we should work together to find common ground that reconciles the competing interests of collective security and individual liberties. We must not focus on one religion as being a threat--this would be wrong and counterproductive. Mr. Speaker, there have been other attacks by foreign and domestic violent extremists. The Fort Hood Texas attack committed by Major Nidal Malik Hasan, who opened fire and killed 13 U.S. military personnel. The Boston Marathon attackers were two Chechen brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev who carried out a bombing that took 3 lives and injured 264 others. Later, the brothers killed university police officer Sean A. Collier. On December 2, 2015, 14 people were killed and 22 were seriously injured in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, which consisted of a mass shooting and an attempted bombing. The perpetrators, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, a married couple living in the city of Redlands, who the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health training event and holiday party, of about 80 employees. This threat of attack by foreign terrorists on American soil is real and substantial and requires vigilance by the Administration and this Congress. However, threats of domestic terrorist attacks are also real. Mr. Speaker, we cannot be unmindful of the fact that since September 2001, there have been 250 deaths at the hands of home grown violent extremists as opposed by 50 by foreign terrorists. The seminal act of homegrown domestic terror occurred in 1995, when the domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh detonated the truck bomb that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 persons and injured over 680 people. At the time, it is the largest loss of American lives at the hands of a domestic terror group since the Civil War. Today, the challenge is countering the messages of violent extremism no matter the source and not to fall for thinking that one type of violent extremism is less of a threat than another type of violent extremism. Radical and extremist groups, both domestic and international, systematically prey upon the vulnerabilities of young persons by offering inducements such as financial assistance, familial-like bonds, or the promise of an exciting and heroic life. In some cases, youth have been forcibly recruited or tricked into participating in terrorist activities, including suicide bombings. The heinous attack in Mother Emmanuel Church was a defining moment in our nation's history for many reasons, but the final chapter will be written by those who are charged with keeping our nation and its people safe while preserving the way of life that terrorist seek to change. One of the enduring challenges for members of the Homeland Security Committee is how we guide the work of the Department of Homeland Security. I hosted DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson in Houston for two days of discussions, and tours that were insightful and probing on a range of regional and national homeland security issues. The issue of violent extremism is one of several efforts that the Department of Homeland Security has prioritized and begun efforts to address both the international threat and the domestic threats. DHS defines ``Domestic Terrorism'' as: ``Any act of violence that is dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources committed by a group or individual based and operating entirely within the United States or its territories without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group.'' Groups and individuals inspired to commit terrorist acts are motivated by a range of personal, religious, political, or other ideological beliefs--there is no magic formula. Further, the complexity of adding social media as a new source of recruitment for violent extremists is complicating the efforts of law enforcement, domestic security and national defense. The line between lawfully protected speech and activity that may be a threat should be clearly defined by law. Taking care to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights means that our system of laws must acknowledge that reading, writing, or speaking of one's views or beliefs even when they are unpopular is not a crime. [[Page H1966]] Hate speech is not a crime--while an act of violence motivated by hate is. Violent extremist threats within the United States can come from a range of violent extremist groups and individuals, including Domestic Terrorists and Homegrown Violent Extremists (HVEs). The troubling violent nature of the attack at Mother Emanuel AME Church, its location in the South, on a night devoted to prayer services, by a young man still in his twenties awaken fears that many of us who represent majority minority congressional districts had hoped were receding with the passage of time. In the wake of the killings at Mother Emanuel in Charleston, several African American Churches have fallen victim to fires. Historically, African American churches are the center of religious, social, cultural and political life for the communities they serve. Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, members serving in this body were mindful of the history that we worked not to repeat. Today, we are still working to assure the public that appropriate checks must be made certain in how increased in government authority is controlled. The demographics of young persons' becoming involved in terrorist groups also appear to be changing. In many cases the persons implicated are younger than reported in the past and there appear to be more female youth joining the ranks of terrorist organizations. Additionally, more young supporters are coming from Western countries that are further removed from actual conflict areas. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas have recruited children as young as thirteen to be suicide bombers and children as young as eleven to smuggle explosives and weapons. During 2003, thirteen-year-old twin sisters who had been recruited by al-Qaeda linked groups were caught attempting to commit a suicide bombing against Western businesses and local government buildings in Morocco. Counter-recruitment and counter-radicalization initiatives should be tailored locally, and should engage members from across the community who are in a position to address specific underlying factors or identify potential radicalization indicators. Counter-recruitment and radicalization initiatives must evolve with the young audiences they are intended to reach, adapt along with the adversaries, incorporate new developments in technologies, and address changes within environments where young persons are susceptible. I encourage my colleagues to withdraw this bill and allow for it to be considered under an open rule or for the bill to be sent back to the committee for further consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Perry). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4820, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,42849,42849,42917,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [house] [pages h1961-h1966] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] combating terrorist recruitment act of 2016 mr. mccaul. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 4820) to require the secretary of homeland security to use the testimonials of former or estranged violent extremists or their associates in order to counter terrorist recruitment, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 4820 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``combating terrorist recruitment act of 2016''. sec. 2. directive.

there was no objection. mr. mccaul. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in strong support of the combating terrorist recruitment act of 2016. i commend mr. fleischmann for offering this bipartisan counterterrorism bill at a time when we are in the highest terror threat environment since 9/11. we have more than 1,000 homegrown terror investigations in all 50 states, and we have arrested over 80 isis supporters in our country, many for plotting attacks. terrorists are radicalizing our citizens online and across borders, which is why we need this legislation. it requires that the secretary of homeland security use the testimonials of former extremists and defectors to help stop terrorist recruitment. president obama himself--and i agree with him on this issue--argued last year: we need to lift up the voice of those who know the hypocrisy of groups like isis firsthand, including former extremists. he also noted: ``former extremists . . . can be powerful messengers in debunking these terrorist ideologies.'' our foreign partners are already using these types of testimonials overseas. so is our state department. but we need to be doing this counter-messaging here at home. homeland security secretary jeh johnson said in front of my committee last month: my priority has been focusing on communities that i believe are most vulnerable to the appeals from isis, al qaeda, and other terrorist groups overseas who are actively targeting individuals in these communities . . . this is as important as any of our other homeland security missions. i commend secretary johnson for his words and his work, but we are not acting quickly enough. that is why this bill was one of the top recommendations of the bipartisan task force we created last year to look at this threat. in their final report, the democratic and republican members who led the task force said america needed to launch a concerted effort to use the testimonials of former extremists to combat terrorist propaganda. this is from a virginia defector. just last month an isis defector from virginia was picked up in iraq. he said he wanted to send a message to the american people that life with isis was miserable and that the group did not represent islam. these are the types of voices we need to amplify so as to keep others from making the same mistakes. some have argued that this bill limits the dhs in allowing it only to counter-message groups like isis and al qaeda, but that is simply false. in fact, at our markup, legislative counsel told the members: ``the current language in the bill is extremely broad-based. it does not place a limitation on anything.'' although our bipartisan task force focused on foreign terrorist threats, the bill gives the secretary the flexibility to address the full array of dangerous groups that threaten our people both here at home and abroad. i am proud to say that the majority of republicans and democrats on the house homeland security committee support this legislation. terrorists are recruiting our citizens at the speed of broadband. so we can't move at the speed of bureaucracy. today congress has an opportunity to fight back. i urge all members to join me in supporting this bill. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in opposition to h.r. 4820, the combating terrorist recruitment act of 2016. it is troubling that some of my colleagues have circulated misinformation about this bill. let me set the record straight. the department of homeland security has repeatedly told my committee that h.r. 4820 is unnecessary insofar as the department can already integrate public testimonials of former terrorists and violent extremists into its efforts to counter violent extremism and terrorism. in fact, yesterday i spoke with secretary johnson, and he reiterated that dhs has the authority it needs to carry out its countering violent extremism efforts and that this bill is unnecessary. i oppose h.r. 4820 today for the same reason i opposed it when it was considered earlier this month in committee. h.r. 4820 is nothing more than a message bill, a bill that sends the message to dhs to focus its counter-messaging efforts on foreign terrorist groups. [[page h1962]] domestic terror groups, like foreign terrorist organizations, recruit and spread propaganda through social media and online platforms. this bill ignores the fact that domestic terror groups, like foreign terrorist organizations, kill americans. since september 11, terrorists who have espoused their ideology of foreign terrorist organizations have been responsible for killing 45 innocent americans on u.s. soil. during that same period, members of domestic terrorist organizations have murdered more than 48 americans. if you ask law enforcement leaders across this country what keeps them up at night, they will likely say the prospect that there is a sovereign citizen group or militia plotting in their jurisdictions. just last month the atlanta police chief testified before my committee that he is deeply concerned about homegrown extremists and militia activity. his testimony echoes the results of a recent survey in which 74 percent of law enforcement identified anti-government extremism as one of the three terrorist threats in their jurisdictions. in the last 2 months, we have seen the development of domestic terrorists: an attack on police officers in georgia by a self-appointed wizard of the ku klux klan; the conviction by a federal grand jury in mississippi of two members of the aryan brotherhood of mississippi for their participation in various criminal acts, including those of drug production, trafficking, kidnapping, and murder; the indictment of two members of a sovereign citizen group in columbus, ohio, for building a bomb that was modeled after the suicide vests that were used in the november paris attack; a four-count indictment against a member of a michigan sovereign citizen group for selling women and children into sexual slavery. such abusive activities are chillingly similar to those of isil. in recognition of these facts, i, together with like-minded committee democrats, made multiple proposals during and after the markup to fix the bill. we offered an amendment to define ``violent extremist'' to encompass not only those engaged in ideologically motivated international terrorism, but also in domestic terrorism. it was rejected. we offered an amendment to insert ``domestic terrorist organization.'' it was also rejected. even after the markup, we made three more proposals to fix the bill. each was rejected. by refusing to include any mention of domestic terrorist organizations, h.r. 4820 represents a significant departure from the holistic, comprehensive approach that has been espoused by the obama administration to counter ideologically based violence. since 2011, with the publication of the ``empowering local partners to prevent extremism in the united states'' strategy by the white house, federal efforts to prevent such terrorism have been guided by the recognition that violent extremists are inspired by a range of religious, political, or other ideological beliefs. the passage of h.r. 4820 would send the wrong message. as such, i urge a ``no'' vote. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. mccaul. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from chattanooga, tennessee (mr. fleischmann), the sponsor and author of the bill. mr. fleischmann. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of my bill, h.r. 4820, the combating terrorist recruitment act. i wish to thank chairman mccaul and the members of the homeland security committee for all of their hard work on this bill. i will never forget the moment back in july--i was standing on this floor--when i was told about the shootings at two military installations in chattanooga, tennessee, the town in which i live and proudly represent. as many of you may remember, four marines and one sailor were killed in the attack while several others were wounded. just this past december, following the fbi investigation, director james comey concluded that the shootings ``were motivated by foreign terrorist organization propaganda.'' given the recent attacks in chattanooga and san bernardino, as well as in paris and brussels, we need to use every tool in the toolbox to combat this new brand of extremism. this bill implements one of the key recommendations made by the homeland security committee's bipartisan task force, one that is specifically designed to counter terrorism and foreign fighter travel. this bill does not forbid dhs from countering all forms of extremism, but the bill does provide examples of how dhs can fulfill the requirement, such as counter-messaging foreign terrorist organizations, which are actively recruiting in our country at an alarming rate. this bipartisan legislation requires the secretary of homeland security to amplify the testimonials of former extremists and defectors to fight the propaganda and the recruitment of terrorist groups like isis. foreign terrorists are using technology to radicalize americans at a troubling pace, which continues to increase. more than 250 americans have traveled or have attempted to travel to fight with jihadists in syria and iraq, and the fbi says there are open counterterrorism investigations in all 50 states, mostly isis related. many of these individuals were pulled in by terrorist propaganda. {time} 1630 isis is luring americans with empty and false promises that do not reflect the true reality on the ground in places like syria and iraq. the true reality centers on fear, suffering, and the murder of innocent people throughout the region and around the world. several recent defectors from isis have admitted that joining the group was a terrible mistake. one young fighter said he found it very hard to live there and no longer believes the group represents their religion. we need to do all we can to amplify the messages from these disillusioned terrorists who have firsthand experience with the evil and hypocrisy of these extremist groups. the state department and many of our key allies already utilize the testimony of those disaffected by the true reality of these terror groups, and the concept was also endorsed by the department of homeland security's homeland security advisory council last spring. unfortunately, there may be partisan opposition to this bipartisan bill. the majority of the homeland security committee members, on both sides of the aisle, supported the bill in committee. i will say it again: this bill received a majority of votes from both sides of the aisle in committee. let's not put partisanship ever ahead of our nation's security. this is a commonsense measure to hinder those recruiting efforts of groups like isis with the testimony of those who have seen the evil of these groups firsthand. i urge the support of my colleagues. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from new jersey (mrs. watson coleman). mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to h.r. 4820, the so-called combating terrorist recruitment bill. h.r. 4820 omits any mention of domestic terrorist organizations, a significant departure from the holistic, comprehensive approach that is adopted by the administration to counter ideologically based violence. this bill isolates the enemy to be those who are islamist, those who are foreign, and those who are being radicalized by foreigners. how does this bill address the threat of terror from those who are not just jaded jihadists, like this bill was initially titled, but, rather, a part of domestic militia or part of a rightwing, ultra- conservative, racist organization that wants to kill african americans or other vulnerable populations? a recent study by the police executive research forum and the triangle center on terrorism and homeland security found that state and local law enforcement personnel are almost twice as concerned about rightwing and antigovernment terrorism as they are about the threat from al qaeda, isis, and similar groups. the concerns of state and local law enforcement about domestic terrorism are well placed. within the last year, we have seen a rightwing terrorist kill [[page h1963]] nine people at mother emanuel in charleston and an anti-abortion terrorist kill three people at the planned parenthood facility in colorado. since the attacks of 9/11, within the united states, domestic terrorists have killed 48 people, more than those killed by foreign terrorist-inspired attacks. shouldn't we be concerned about those who have demonstrated the greatest threat to our homeland in the last 15 years? h.r. 4820 represents a marked departure from a national strategy to combat terrorism and that recognizes that individuals who promote and use violence against the u.s. are inspired by a range of religious, political, or other ideological beliefs. the speaker pro tempore (mr. curbelo of florida). the time of the gentlewoman has expired. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. mrs. watson coleman. this bill only serves to perpetuate the stigma associated with just one group of people who happen to practice islam. it does not recognize a full range of terrorist threats to our homeland. i urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on h.r. 4820. mr. mccaul. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from new york (mr. katko), the original cosponsor of the bill and the chairman of the bipartisan task force. mr. katko. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from tennessee for offering this legislation. mr. speaker, america continues to witness the largest convergence of radical islamic threats in the history of our country. more than any threat before, isis demonstrated an ability to radicalize individuals throughout the world by utilizing the internet. however, these individuals are met with the cold, hard reality that isis does not offer luxury, happiness, or peacefulness. on the contrary, these individuals are thrust onto the battlefield with little or no training and little or no regard for their lives. some, when faced with the truth, try to turn back. among those who recognize isis for the barbaric, destructive force that it is, some have actually dared to speak out against them, using their experience to dissuade others from risking their lives in order to wage war on innocent people. one of these individuals was mentioned by my colleague, chairman mike mccaul, and that individual grew up across the river from here in alexandria, virginia. mr. speaker, i rise to support the efforts of our law enforcement and intelligence officials by supporting this bill. the combating terrorist recruitment act of 2016, of which i am a cosponsor, requires a dissemination of testimonials from isis defectors to help stop the radicalization of at-risk individuals. this bill comes from the bipartisan task force on combating terrorist and foreign fighter travel, of which i served as a republican lead. using these testimonials would fill a gap that our bipartisan task force identified in a bipartisan manner. i thank chairman mccaul, who has led this effort. i encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. pascrell). mr. pascrell. mr. speaker, i certainly don't question the motivations of the gentleman who has sponsored this bill. he is a good man, a good american, and loves his country, but i believe it is misdirected. i really do. in my hand, if you remember, there is a report from 2009, the beginning of the obama administration. all that work was done in the previous administration on this report. the report is quite revealing. anybody who is on homeland security should read it because it tells us that we need not only to carry out the oath of office, half of it, but we should defend the country against foreign intruders. also, it says in our oath ``domestic'' as well. this report lays out very clearly what is going on in the united states of america in our backyards. it was squashed. i remember the day when a democratic secretary of the homeland security heard from me about it, that she should not have bent over because those on the other side wanted this report squashed. there have been articles written since that time, 2009, of how it was squashed. they didn't want the american people to read this. that is quite, quite a report. so i rise in opposition, mr. speaker, to h.r. 4820. no one loves this country more than the gentleman from mississippi (mr. thompson). i am not on that committee anymore, but no one respects it more than bennie thompson. why is he opposed to this? is he opposed to this because he doesn't love his country as much as the folks on the other side of the aisle? i don't think so. does he oppose it because he didn't sponsor it? i don't think so. he opposes it because this excludes very specific things which we should not exclude. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman from new jersey an additional 1 minute. mr. pascrell. the house should not be picking and choosing what sources of terrorism the department should focus on without taking into account all the facts. the house continues to ignore the threats posed by violent extremism, which are not limited to a single ideology. eric hoffer, in the book ``the true believer,'' written many years ago, said that extremism is inspired by a range of reasons, including religious, political, or ideological beliefs. he says that these movements, regardless of the motive or end goal, simply need isolated individuals who are dispossessed in some way or other and need to feel part of something bigger than themselves. why don't we really get at the sources of the people who want to kill our kids and want to damage our properties, whether they come from afar or whether they are grown right here? homegrown. homegrown. and we are ignoring it. the fbi reports that time and time again. mr. mccaul. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. hurd). mr. hurd of texas. ``it's not a revolution or jihad. it's a slaughter. i was shocked by what i did.'' ``i found it very, very hard to live there. isis fighters don't represent the religion. i don't see them as good muslims.'' mr. speaker, those are the words of americans who traveled overseas to fight alongside isis. they left home believing they were headed toward a great adventure. they were promised glory and honor, but what they found was death and a perversion of the religion they believe in. these fighters were originally recruited to fight for isis through social media. every day isis spreads their lies and propaganda, drawing in naive young americans. they do this in dozens of different languages, reaching people across the world. even while isis loses ground on the battlefield, they are working hard to make it up in the digital sphere. the combating terrorist recruitment act will allow us to take these powerful words of truth and use them to combat the lies that isis is spreading on social media. some may say this is unnecessary. some may say: why aren't we already doing this? we aren't. that is why we need this piece of legislation. this bill requires the secretary of homeland security to use the testimonials of former extremists and defectors as part of an ongoing effort to stop terrorist recruitment. these are individuals who have seen the brutality of terrorist groups firsthand and have rejected it. this bill is not limited to specific groups. let me repeat that one more time: this bill is not limited to specific groups. it gives our counterterrorism professionals the flexibility needed to fight back against extremists as the threat environment and terrorist tactics change. it also requires dhs to coordinate these efforts with other agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and foreign partners so that we do this the right way, finding the best outlets for undermining terrorist propaganda. [[page h1964]] the bipartisan foreign fighter task force i served on recommends that we use these credible voices to fight against isis' online efforts. the nonpartisan homeland security advisory council has urged dhs to use the testimonials of former extremists in our counternarrative efforts. our foreign partners are already using these tactics and finding them effective. our young people are being targeted. we have the tools to help protect them. these tools can stop others in our hometowns from making a terrible mistake. we need to get in the online fight, but time is not on our side. i encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of the combating terrorist recruitment act. having spent 9\1/2\ years as an undercover officer chasing terrorists across the world, there is no such thing as a silver bullet. we have to do this piecemeal, and this bill is one step going in that direction. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from oregon (mr. defazio), the ranking member on the house transportation committee. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i rise today as one who served from the creation of the homeland security committee until just a couple of years ago. i am concerned about what i am hearing here today on the floor, and i am surprised. perhaps we should insert the word ``some,'' combating some terrorist recruitment in 2016. now, the chairman said that dhs certainly has the flexibility to address domestic terrorism. well, that is true. but why leave out explicit mention of domestic terrorism? {time} 1645 are you afraid of offending some rightwing nuts out there? what is the deal? seriously, i just went through this in oregon. i have been on the department of justice and the fbi for about 2 years: go get cliven bundy, get his cattle off the land, put the guy in jail. they didn't do it. and what happened? he taught his kids the way it was done. you show the government a gun, and they will run away, and you keep doing what you want, and you can deny that the federal government has the right to own any public lands in this country and try and take them over for private individuals. now, this is a serious threat. the murrah building, there were no foreign terrorists involved, 168 dead, hundreds injured, and we can't explicitly put into this bill all terrorism, including domestic terrorism. i really fear that some are worried that some of these rightwing extremist groups out there might be offended if we were to say that they are a threat to our nation. well, they are very much a threat, and this bill omitting that should have this bill denied passage on this floor and bring it back in a comprehensive way next week. mr. mccaul. mr. speaker, i yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman from new york (mr. donovan). mr. donovan. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 4820, the combating terrorist recruitment act authored by mr. fleischmann. this bill is one step in implementing the recommendations of the committee on homeland security's foreign fighter task force. this bipartisan team was charged with studying how our government can combat western citizens who become radicalized and take up arms with terrorists. the president, senior national security officials, industry leaders, and experts have all expressed support for this concept. while all self-radicalized terrorists deserve the consequences of their behavior, some realize just how profound they were mistaken after seeing the reality of life under isis. they sometimes recant and tell the truth about the atrocities that they have witnessed or committed. that is valuable information. what this bill does is common sense. it directs the secretary of homeland security to use testimony from these individuals as part of our efforts to combat violent extremists. president obama himself stated that we need to ``lift up the voices'' of former extremists in order to expose the hypocrisy of isis, but this bill does not limit the department's ability to countermeasure terrorist groups that threaten us no matter where they are located. as we speak, isis is using social media and the internet to radicalize young americans who are vulnerable to a message of inclusion in a grand cause, no matter how sinister. before they make a mistake that could cause them and others their lives, let's take every opportunity to counter isis' poisonous narrative. to hear from others like them who wanted to believe in isis and found the truth too late is a tactic we should utilize. i urge my colleagues to pass this bill, which received bipartisan support in committee. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i have no further speakers and i am prepared to close. mr. mccaul. mr. speaker, i yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. perry). mr. perry. mr. speaker, i would like to thank the gentleman from tennessee for offering this bill, as well as chairman mccaul for bringing it to the floor. when the terrorists attacked in san bernardino, many americans said: what are we doing? when you find out that these folks are trafficking on the internet and messaging, they say: where is our fbi? where are the services protecting us, and why aren't they doing everything they can? this is one thing they can do is offer testimonials from people who have been there who can give other people who might be interested in joining the truth. yet there are some folks here who don't want to do that. they are interested in misrepresenting this bill. i want to remind everybody that this bill is the result of a bipartisan task force, a bipartisan task force, member-led, that said we need to do exactly this, and unanimously move this forward to the full committee. they say it is unnecessary. well, if it is unnecessary, why isn't homeland security doing this already? why not? how long are they going to wait? they say that they offered amendments. really? they offered amendments? they couldn't be bothered to answer the chairman's call when he said: hey, can you collaborate with us on this so we have a good bill that everybody is involved in. they waited until the day of the markup, and then came in with a bunch of amendments and concerns. it was apparent that all they wanted to do was slow the process down and, as a matter of fact, move the process to some other date. how long are we going to wait? do you want to ask the relatives of those who are killed by these people how long they want to wait? how about the next ones? now, some on the other side have picked this up as this is a politically motivated agenda. i say some because not all. as a matter of fact, many on the other side voted to move this bill right to the floor where it is now. i don't understand why they would want to have america be less safe. i don't understand, mr. speaker. we spent 4 hours--4 hours--going over a two-page bill. two pages. we entertained what they wanted to change, and we did make some changes, but it was apparent that all they wanted to really do was stall and stall and move this process forward down the line and never get to it. mr. speaker, we don't have any choice. we have to move forward now. those in opposition are simply willfully refusing to see what all america sees. we need to address this threat immediately. it is a two- page bill, and it doesn't deny homeland security from doing anything that it has already been doing. as a matter of fact, these folks on the other side demanded at that markup--they demanded--that we say that homeland security must do this. and the chairman said: okay, if you want to demand that they do it, we will demand that they do it. mr. speaker, i think we ought to make america safe and pass this bill. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, in recent years, from boston to charleston, we have seen individuals operating within our communities and living among us plot to cause mass harm in the name of a violent extremist and hateful ideology. today much has been made of the fact that the fbi has open investigations of isil-inspired activity in all 50 states. far less [[page h1965]] attention has been given to the number of open investigations of anti- government and militia groups, a number that grew by one-third in 2015 alone. we cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the threats posed by any terrorist group or organization, as the bill before us today would do. therefore, it is imperative that dhs use testimonials from violent extremists involved in all forms of violent extremism. public testimonials can be a powerful tool to reach individuals who otherwise might be susceptible to terrorist propaganda. given the diversity in the threat landscape that we face, it just makes sense that any such effort should be comprehensive. unfortunately, the bill's sponsors have decided that this bill should turn away from the comprehensive approach. mr. speaker, again, let me indicate that the only real issue before us is the domestic aspect of terrorism. domestic terrorist organizations have demonstrated time and time again, they have killed more americans here on our soil than foreign terrorists have. the reason we are in opposition is we don't recognize that in this legislation. our effort in markup, as well as here on the floor, is to make sure that all of the bad people get recognized, those international and foreign, but also those who are domestic. some of us have lived in parts of the country where domestic terrorism was a way of life for a lot of us, and because of that, we are very passionate on that subject. the charleston situation was very unfortunate. that was an act of domestic terrorism. there is no question about it. so why wouldn't we want to add those kind of extremist activities in this legislation so we can cover everyone? that is really the opposition that we have had. for that reason, i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing h.r. 4820. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. mccaul. i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, paris, brussels, chattanooga, san bernardino. how many more? mr. speaker, it is time to act, and act today on this important legislation that is bipartisan. it is important to point out--i know the ranking member has good intentions, but our bill allows dhs to combat terrorist recruitment by all dangerous organizations, as was brought out at the markup. the president's homeland security adviser, lisa monaco, said: ``our efforts will be the most effective when they focus on amplifying authentic voices,'' such as former violent extremists. these voices can convince others from going down the path to violence. the president's national security adviser, susan rice, added that they are already amplifying the voices of isil defectors overseas. and she explains that ``these voices are eroding isil's appeal.'' this countermessaging works, and it has worked for the state department, but we are not doing it at home. we need to do it here at home and not just overseas. that is why i urge strong support for this. i don't understand after it being the product of a bipartisan task force with bipartisan support out of the committee, the very week that the brussels attack occurred, we marked up this bill. mr. speaker, it is time to act. i urge passage of this bill. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise to speak in opposition to h.r. 4820, the ``combating terrorist recruitment act of 2016,'' because regrettably the bill was not improved as i had hoped and expected between the committee markup and, floor consideration. specifically, section 2 of h.r. 4820, directs the secretary of homeland security, inter alia, to employ ``counter-messaging of foreign terrorist organization communications and narratives.'' however, the bill is silent on the issue of domestic terrorists and the threat they pose to the safety and security of americans. this was a point raised by the minority members during the markup, but an agreement could not be reached to include the words ``and domestic terrorist'' in the bill. as a senior member of the house committee on homeland security and ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations, i appreciate the concerns the bill is intended to address but in my view the bill's scope is too limited in view of the number and frequency of violent domestic extremist attacks such as the one occurring in the evening of june 17, 2015 at the historic mother emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston, south carolina. combating violent extremism is too important to become the subject of partisan political disputes. instead, we should work together to find common ground that reconciles the competing interests of collective security and individual liberties. we must not focus on one religion as being a threat--this would be wrong and counterproductive. mr. speaker, there have been other attacks by foreign and domestic violent extremists. the fort hood texas attack committed by major nidal malik hasan, who opened fire and killed 13 u.s. military personnel. the boston marathon attackers were two chechen brothers dzhokhar tsarnaev and tamerlan tsarnaev who carried out a bombing that took 3 lives and injured 264 others. later, the brothers killed university police officer sean a. collier. on december 2, 2015, 14 people were killed and 22 were seriously injured in a terrorist attack in san bernardino, california, which consisted of a mass shooting and an attempted bombing. the perpetrators, syed rizwan farook and tashfeen malik, a married couple living in the city of redlands, who the san bernardino county department of public health training event and holiday party, of about 80 employees. this threat of attack by foreign terrorists on american soil is real and substantial and requires vigilance by the administration and this congress. however, threats of domestic terrorist attacks are also real. mr. speaker, we cannot be unmindful of the fact that since september 2001, there have been 250 deaths at the hands of home grown violent extremists as opposed by 50 by foreign terrorists. the seminal act of homegrown domestic terror occurred in 1995, when the domestic terrorist timothy mcveigh detonated the truck bomb that destroyed the alfred p. murrah federal building, killing 168 persons and injured over 680 people. at the time, it is the largest loss of american lives at the hands of a domestic terror group since the civil war. today, the challenge is countering the messages of violent extremism no matter the source and not to fall for thinking that one type of violent extremism is less of a threat than another type of violent extremism. radical and extremist groups, both domestic and international, systematically prey upon the vulnerabilities of young persons by offering inducements such as financial assistance, familial-like bonds, or the promise of an exciting and heroic life. in some cases, youth have been forcibly recruited or tricked into participating in terrorist activities, including suicide bombings. the heinous attack in mother emmanuel church was a defining moment in our nation's history for many reasons, but the final chapter will be written by those who are charged with keeping our nation and its people safe while preserving the way of life that terrorist seek to change. one of the enduring challenges for members of the homeland security committee is how we guide the work of the department of homeland security. i hosted dhs secretary jeh johnson in houston for two days of discussions, and tours that were insightful and probing on a range of regional and national homeland security issues. the issue of violent extremism is one of several efforts that the department of homeland security has prioritized and begun efforts to address both the international threat and the domestic threats. dhs defines ``domestic terrorism'' as: ``any act of violence that is dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources committed by a group or individual based and operating entirely within the united states or its territories without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group.'' groups and individuals inspired to commit terrorist acts are motivated by a range of personal, religious, political, or other ideological beliefs--there is no magic formula. further, the complexity of adding social media as a new source of recruitment for violent extremists is complicating the efforts of law enforcement, domestic security and national defense. the line between lawfully protected speech and activity that may be a threat should be clearly defined by law. taking care to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights means that our system of laws must acknowledge that reading, writing, or speaking of one's views or beliefs even when they are unpopular is not a crime. [[page h1966]] hate speech is not a crime--while an act of violence motivated by hate is. violent extremist threats within the united states can come from a range of violent extremist groups and individuals, including domestic terrorists and homegrown violent extremists (hves). the troubling violent nature of the attack at mother emanuel ame church, its location in the south, on a night devoted to prayer services, by a young man still in his twenties awaken fears that many of us who represent majority minority congressional districts had hoped were receding with the passage of time. in the wake of the killings at mother emanuel in charleston, several african american churches have fallen victim to fires. historically, african american churches are the center of religious, social, cultural and political life for the communities they serve. since the tragic events of september 11, 2001, members serving in this body were mindful of the history that we worked not to repeat. today, we are still working to assure the public that appropriate checks must be made certain in how increased in government authority is controlled. the demographics of young persons' becoming involved in terrorist groups also appear to be changing. in many cases the persons implicated are younger than reported in the past and there appear to be more female youth joining the ranks of terrorist organizations. additionally, more young supporters are coming from western countries that are further removed from actual conflict areas. the palestinian islamic jihad and hamas have recruited children as young as thirteen to be suicide bombers and children as young as eleven to smuggle explosives and weapons. during 2003, thirteen-year-old twin sisters who had been recruited by al-qaeda linked groups were caught attempting to commit a suicide bombing against western businesses and local government buildings in morocco. counter-recruitment and counter-radicalization initiatives should be tailored locally, and should engage members from across the community who are in a position to address specific underlying factors or identify potential radicalization indicators. counter-recruitment and radicalization initiatives must evolve with the young audiences they are intended to reach, adapt along with the adversaries, incorporate new developments in technologies, and address changes within environments where young persons are susceptible. i encourage my colleagues to withdraw this bill and allow for it to be considered under an open rule or for the bill to be sent back to the committee for further consideration. the speaker pro tempore (mr. perry). the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. mccaul) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 4820, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",42849

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as I have come to appreciate the seriousness of the many threats facing our transportation systems, I realize that one of the most targeted and vulnerable points of attack exist for our international in-bound aviation. It is no secret that terror groups across the world value the horrific symbolism of bringing down an aircraft and are continuously plotting to take down planes. They recognize that it is easier for them to attack an aircraft destined for the United States from overseas rather than travel to the United States and then plot a domestic attack. This understanding is nothing new. My own district of Syracuse, New York, tragically learned of terrorists' determination to bring down airplanes when 35 Syracuse University students and students from other local universities, along with my close friend's sister, were killed in the Lockerbie bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988. Now, with the horrific attacks in Belgium against two transportation modes, including aviation, it has been reiterated that we must not wait for such attacks to occur in the homeland. We must be as determined to mitigate the threat as extremists are in perpetrating their attacks against us. The Brussels attacks took place against the European capital with one of the explosions occurring just a few blocks from the European Parliament. {time} 1700 I was near those sites not too long ago, where those explosions took place, when visiting Brussels as part of a congressional delegation focused on stemming the flow of ISIS-affiliated foreign fighters, so I am particularly reminded of how close to home such attacks really are. While a number of security enhancements have been made in recent months by the Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration, and airlines, more must be done. SAFE GATES is an important, bipartisan bill which requires TSA's Office of Global Strategies to comprehensively assess its own mission needs, with the intent of directing resources in a more intelligence-driven, risk-based manner. Further, the legislation directs TSA to provide better communication and foster stronger partnerships with foreign partners and airlines in order to make sure that everyone with a stake in securing aviation is aware of the serious threats facing our skies. Lastly, the SAFE GATES Act authorizes the donation of critical security screening equipment and bolsters TSA's authority to mandate overseas cargo security standards as a means of building capacity for the security of aircraft headed for the United States. Recently, our colleagues in the Senate added this language to authorizing language for the Federal Aviation Administration. During the amendment process, Chairman Thune of the Senate Commerce Committee added the text of this bill, along with some additional provisions, to push TSA to work toward developing a new generation of security screening checkpoints. This provision incorporates critical stakeholder feedback by empowering the Aviation Security Advisory Committee to make recommendations to the Administrator concerning checkpoints of the future. In preparation for bringing this legislation to the floor today, and in agreement with my Democratic colleagues, we have added this thoughtful provision to our bill as well. I would like to thank my bipartisan cosponsor, Congressman Keating, for his unwavering support of this critically important legislation. Moreover, I wish to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. McCaul, and the ranking member, Mr. Thompson, for moving this bill through committee so we can bring our efforts to bear on the House floor today. Lastly, I want to applaud Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson of the Senate Commerce Committee for making sure that this bill text was added as a security provision to the Senate's FAA legislation, and I look forward to working closely with my Senate colleagues going forward to get this legislation to the President's desk. This legislation stands as a testament to the rare ability of Congress to come together in a bicameral and bipartisan manner to make the American people more secure. It also serves as a direct refute to those terrorists plotting to harm the American people, the American economy, and our right to move about freely without fear and without hindrance. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4698, the SAFE GATES Act. Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us comes at a very important time. Recent events have fueled increased interest in addressing terrorism threats at overseas airports. Just last month, a terrorist cell carried out three simultaneous, coordinated attacks on the Brussels airport and a major rail station that resulted in the death of 32 people and injuries to over 300 people. At the airport, terrorists filled large suitcases with nail bombs that were detonated in two separate explosions on the public side of the airport. This [[Page H1968]] attack, in the heart of the European Union's capital, underscores the reality that the aviation sector continues to be a major terrorist target. Previously, in February, a terrorist boarded a commercial aircraft departing from Mogadishu with a bomb concealed in a laptop. The terrorist detonated the bomb aboard the aircraft, killing himself and injuring two others. Experts suggest that, had the terrorist detonated the bomb at a higher altitude, the damage to the plane would have been catastrophic and the aircraft would have been destroyed. The deadliest aviation attack in recent memory took place in October 2015, when Metrojet flight 9268, departing from Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport, was blown up over the northern Sinai. This horrific tragedy resulted in the loss of 224 lives. H.R. 4698 is responsive to these devastating incidents. It focuses on last point of departure airports, or those airports that originate from foreign countries that fly to the U.S. nonstop, to airports within the U.S. H.R. 4698 requires TSA to do a security assessment of these airports and take into account: the level of coordination and cooperation between the countries in which the airports are located and TSA; the intelligence capabilities of each country; information on the numbers of known or suspected terrorists transiting through such airports; and the security screening capabilities at these airports. The legislation also requires TSA to submit a plan to bolster and enhance security collaboration between the U.S. and its foreign and domestic partners and authorizes TSA to donate security screening equipment to a foreign airport if it will reduce specific vulnerabilities to the security of the U.S. or U.S. citizens. In addition to codifying TSA's efforts to bolster security at last point of departure airports, H.R. 4698 also seeks to make enhancements to security screening at U.S. airports. Specifically, it directs TSA to request that the Aviation Security Advisory Committee develop recommendations to make passenger screening processes more efficient and effective. The areas that the ASAC would be considering include checkpoint configuration, technology innovation, and best practices within aviation security. As the lead author of legislation authorizing the ASAC, I strongly believe that this body, which is composed of key stakeholders from throughout the aviation community, is a positive catalyst for improvement within TSA. Mr. Speaker, I close by saying that there is bipartisan support for this legislation. While on the subject of addressing overseas threats, I would note that, in recent years, DHS has made great strides in pushing the borders out, that is, identifying and stopping overseas threats before they reach our borders. Congress needs to support these efforts. To that end, in the coming weeks, I will be introducing comprehensive legislation to expand and strengthen DHS' overseas program aimed at vetting and screening travelers to the U.S. My legislation, entitled Pushing Out America's Borders Act of 2016, seeks to accelerate DHS' efforts at expanding and establishing overseas posts for both CBP and ICE to conduct critical traveler vetting and screening operations. With the passage of H.R. 4698 today, the House is poised to raise the level of aviation security overseas. The next challenge for this body is to support DHS in its efforts to take more proactive approaches to pushing out our Nation's border security. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Katko's cooperation in making sure that this bill was brought to the floor. We had a couple of hiccups along the way, but we worked them out. This is really how it should be done, and I appreciate the gentleman's help in getting us there. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now. Threats to international-bound aviation are proliferating every day, and the Department of Homeland Security, TSA, and airlines need the adequate tools and authorities necessary to ensure the safety and security of traveling Americans. Without the authorities and oversight built into this legislation, I fear that Congress will not be doing all it can to stay ahead of the persistent threats posed by violent extremists. We have seen the threat they pose in Brussels and in last year's attacks on airliners overseas. So we must not wait to mitigate these threats until it is too late. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of Capitol Hill for working together to develop this important piece of legislation. I again urge my colleagues to support this bill. I want to thank the ranking member for his cooperation. Yes, we had some hiccups, but that is part of the process. The fact of the matter is that we had a very good bill by working together and talking together. While the last colloquy on the last bill, H.R. 2820, showed we do have differences, I dare say that on the Homeland Security Committee we have far more agreements than we have disagreements, and I hope we can continue in that manner going forward. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4698, the ``Securing Aviation from Foreign Entry Points and Guarding Airports through Enhanced Security Act of 2016.'' As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, and a former chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation and Security, I have been committed to protecting and improving the security of our nation's airways. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) needs all the support we can provide to aid them in protecting our nation against security threats. The critical work of TSA agents around the country provides security for the nation's airports, maintains a security force to screen all commercial airline passengers and baggage, and works with the transportation, law enforcement and intelligence communities to ensure safety. In 2015, TSA officers screened 708,316,339 million passengers (more than 1.9 million per day) at more than 450 airports across the nation-- which is 40,780,330 million more passengers than for the same timeframe in 2014. In addition to screening more than 708 million passengers last year, TSA officers also screened 1.6 billion carry-on bags, 432 million checked bags and 12.9 million airport employees. Obtaining critical information about TSA's procedures and planning while handling enhanced security screenings throughout the country will only make us stronger and safer. The Congressional District I represent in Houston, Texas is home to two of the world's busiest airports. The Bush International and the William P. Hobby Airports are essential hubs for domestic and international air travel for Houston and the region. Nearly 40 million passengers traveled through Bush International Airport (IAH) and an additional 10 million traveled through William P. Hobby (HOU). IAH is the 11th busiest airport in the U.S. for total passenger traffic with more than 650 daily departures. Since January, IAH has seen a significant increase in both international and domestic travelers. International travel in the first half of 2015 increased by 3.9 percent compared to the same period last year. More than 5.1 million international passengers boarded flights out of IAH. It is estimated that at the current rate, IAH could see nearly 10.2 million international passengers by the end of the year. In October 2015, in an effort to re-establish the airport's daily international air service, the William P. Hobby Airport opened a new 280,000 foot complex that includes five gates for its international concourse. This addition is expected to support travel service for nearly 7,500 international passengers and 25 departing flights a day. Enhanced security protects our economic interests, more importantly; implementing this bill will protect our citizens. H.R. 4698 will direct the TSA to conduct a comprehensive security risk assessment of all last point of departure airports with nonstop flights to the United States. H.R. 4698 will also require TSA to submit to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) a plan to: --enhance collaboration, coordination, and information-sharing about international-inbound aviation between the United States and domestic and foreign partners in order to enhance security capabilities at foreign airports, --assess TSA ability to enter into a mutual agreement with a foreign government entity to permit TSA representatives to conduct inspections of foreign airports without prior notice. [[Page H1969]] Through H.R. 4698: GAO will review TSA efforts to enhance security capabilities at foreign airports and secure international-inbound aviation. TSA will submit to Congress a comprehensive workforce assessment of all TSA personnel within its Office of Global Strategies or whose primary professional duties contribute to the TSA's global efforts to secure transportation security, including whether they are assigned in a risk-based, intelligence-driven matter. TSA may donate security screening equipment to a foreign last point of departure airport operator if the equipment can be expected to mitigate a specific vulnerability to U.S. security or U.S. citizens. TSA may evaluate foreign countries' air cargo programs to determine whether they provide a level of security commensurate with that required by U.S. air cargo security programs. Mr. Speaker, we cannot wait until our security is breached by terrorists before we act, otherwise we would not have learned the lessons of September 11, 2001. I urge my colleagues on the Committee to join me in supporting this important step forward to protecting our airports. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4698, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1966-H1969] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SECURING AVIATION FROM FOREIGN ENTRY POINTS AND GUARDING AIRPORTS THROUGH ENHANCED SECURITY ACT OF 2016 Mr. KATKO.

We must be as determined to mitigate the threat as extremists are in perpetrating their attacks against us. The Brussels attacks took place against the European capital with one of the explosions occurring just a few blocks from the European Parliament. {time} 1700 I was near those sites not too long ago, where those explosions took place, when visiting Brussels as part of a congressional delegation focused on stemming the flow of ISIS-affiliated foreign fighters, so I am particularly reminded of how close to home such attacks really are. While a number of security enhancements have been made in recent months by the Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration, and airlines, more must be done. SAFE GATES is an important, bipartisan bill which requires TSA's Office of Global Strategies to comprehensively assess its own mission needs, with the intent of directing resources in a more intelligence-driven, risk-based manner. Further, the legislation directs TSA to provide better communication and foster stronger partnerships with foreign partners and airlines in order to make sure that everyone with a stake in securing aviation is aware of the serious threats facing our skies. Lastly, the SAFE GATES Act authorizes the donation of critical security screening equipment and bolsters TSA's authority to mandate overseas cargo security standards as a means of building capacity for the security of aircraft headed for the United States. Recently, our colleagues in the Senate added this language to authorizing language for the Federal Aviation Administration. During the amendment process, Chairman Thune of the Senate Commerce Committee added the text of this bill, along with some additional provisions, to push TSA to work toward developing a new generation of security screening checkpoints. This provision incorporates critical stakeholder feedback by empowering the Aviation Security Advisory Committee to make recommendations to the Administrator concerning checkpoints of the future. In preparation for bringing this legislation to the floor today, and in agreement with my Democratic colleagues, we have added this thoughtful provision to our bill as well. I would like to thank my bipartisan cosponsor, Congressman Keating, for his unwavering support of this critically important legislation. Moreover, I wish to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. McCaul, and the ranking member, Mr. Thompson, for moving this bill through committee so we can bring our efforts to bear on the House floor today. Lastly, I want to applaud Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson of the Senate Commerce Committee for making sure that this bill text was added as a security provision to the Senate's FAA legislation, and I look forward to working closely with my Senate colleagues going forward to get this legislation to the President's desk. This legislation stands as a testament to the rare ability of Congress to come together in a bicameral and bipartisan manner to make the American people more secure. It also serves as a direct refute to those terrorists plotting to harm the American people, the American economy, and our right to move about freely without fear and without hindrance. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4698, the SAFE GATES Act. Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us comes at a very important time. Recent events have fueled increased interest in addressing terrorism threats at overseas airports. Just last month, a terrorist cell carried out three simultaneous, coordinated attacks on the Brussels airport and a major rail station that resulted in the death of 32 people and injuries to over 300 people. At the airport, terrorists filled large suitcases with nail bombs that were detonated in two separate explosions on the public side of the airport. This [[Page H1968]] attack, in the heart of the European Union's capital, underscores the reality that the aviation sector continues to be a major terrorist target. Previously, in February, a terrorist boarded a commercial aircraft departing from Mogadishu with a bomb concealed in a laptop. The terrorist detonated the bomb aboard the aircraft, killing himself and injuring two others. Experts suggest that, had the terrorist detonated the bomb at a higher altitude, the damage to the plane would have been catastrophic and the aircraft would have been destroyed. The deadliest aviation attack in recent memory took place in October 2015, when Metrojet flight 9268, departing from Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport, was blown up over the northern Sinai. This horrific tragedy resulted in the loss of 224 lives. H.R. 4698 is responsive to these devastating incidents. It focuses on last point of departure airports, or those airports that originate from foreign countries that fly to the U.S. nonstop, to airports within the U.S. H.R. 4698 requires TSA to do a security assessment of these airports and take into account: the level of coordination and cooperation between the countries in which the airports are located and TSA; the intelligence capabilities of each country; information on the numbers of known or suspected terrorists transiting through such airports; and the security screening capabilities at these airports. The legislation also requires TSA to submit a plan to bolster and enhance security collaboration between the U.S. and its foreign and domestic partners and authorizes TSA to donate security screening equipment to a foreign airport if it will reduce specific vulnerabilities to the security of the U.S. or U.S. citizens. In addition to codifying TSA's efforts to bolster security at last point of departure airports, H.R. 4698 also seeks to make enhancements to security screening at U.S. airports. Specifically, it directs TSA to request that the Aviation Security Advisory Committee develop recommendations to make passenger screening processes more efficient and effective. The areas that the ASAC would be considering include checkpoint configuration, technology innovation, and best practices within aviation security. As the lead author of legislation authorizing the ASAC, I strongly believe that this body, which is composed of key stakeholders from throughout the aviation community, is a positive catalyst for improvement within TSA. Mr. Speaker, I close by saying that there is bipartisan support for this legislation. While on the subject of addressing overseas threats, I would note that, in recent years, DHS has made great strides in pushing the borders out, that is, identifying and stopping overseas threats before they reach our borders. Congress needs to support these efforts. To that end, in the coming weeks, I will be introducing comprehensive legislation to expand and strengthen DHS' overseas program aimed at vetting and screening travelers to the U.S. My legislation, entitled Pushing Out America's Borders Act of 2016, seeks to accelerate DHS' efforts at expanding and establishing overseas posts for both CBP and ICE to conduct critical traveler vetting and screening operations. With the passage of H.R. 4698 today, the House is poised to raise the level of aviation security overseas. The next challenge for this body is to support DHS in its efforts to take more proactive approaches to pushing out our Nation's border security. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Katko's cooperation in making sure that this bill was brought to the floor. We had a couple of hiccups along the way, but we worked them out. This is really how it should be done, and I appreciate the gentleman's help in getting us there. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now. Threats to international-bound aviation are proliferating every day, and the Department of Homeland Security, TSA, and airlines need the adequate tools and authorities necessary to ensure the safety and security of traveling Americans. Without the authorities and oversight built into this legislation, I fear that Congress will not be doing all it can to stay ahead of the persistent threats posed by violent extremists. We have seen the threat they pose in Brussels and in last year's attacks on airliners overseas. So we must not wait to mitigate these threats until it is too late. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of Capitol Hill for working together to develop this important piece of legislation. I again urge my colleagues to support this bill. I want to thank the ranking member for his cooperation. Yes, we had some hiccups, but that is part of the process. The fact of the matter is that we had a very good bill by working together and talking together. While the last colloquy on the last bill, H.R. 2820, showed we do have differences, I dare say that on the Homeland Security Committee we have far more agreements than we have disagreements, and I hope we can continue in that manner going forward. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4698, the ``Securing Aviation from Foreign Entry Points and Guarding Airports through Enhanced Security Act of 2016.'' As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, and a former chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation and Security, I have been committed to protecting and improving the security of our nation's airways. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) needs all the support we can provide to aid them in protecting our nation against security threats. The critical work of TSA agents around the country provides security for the nation's airports, maintains a security force to screen all commercial airline passengers and baggage, and works with the transportation, law enforcement and intelligence communities to ensure safety. In 2015, TSA officers screened 708,316,339 million passengers (more than 1.9 million per day) at more than 450 airports across the nation-- which is 40,780,330 million more passengers than for the same timeframe in 2014. In addition to screening more than 708 million passengers last year, TSA officers also screened 1.6 billion carry-on bags, 432 million checked bags and 12.9 million airport employees. Obtaining critical information about TSA's procedures and planning while handling enhanced security screenings throughout the country will only make us stronger and safer. The Congressional District I represent in Houston, Texas is home to two of the world's busiest airports. The Bush International and the William P. Hobby Airports are essential hubs for domestic and international air travel for Houston and the region. Nearly 40 million passengers traveled through Bush International Airport (IAH) and an additional 10 million traveled through William P. Hobby (HOU). IAH is the 11th busiest airport in the U.S. for total passenger traffic with more than 650 daily departures. Since January, IAH has seen a significant increase in both international and domestic travelers. International travel in the first half of 2015 increased by 3.9 percent compared to the same period last year. More than 5.1 million international passengers boarded flights out of IAH. It is estimated that at the current rate, IAH could see nearly 10.2 million international passengers by the end of the year. In October 2015, in an effort to re-establish the airport's daily international air service, the William P. Hobby Airport opened a new 280,000 foot complex that includes five gates for its international concourse. This addition is expected to support travel service for nearly 7,500 international passengers and 25 departing flights a day. Enhanced security protects our economic interests, more importantly; implementing this bill will protect our citizens. H.R. 4698 will direct the TSA to conduct a comprehensive security risk assessment of all last point of departure airports with nonstop flights to the United States. H.R. 4698 will also require TSA to submit to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) a plan to: --enhance collaboration, coordination, and information-sharing about international-inbound aviation between the United States and domestic and foreign partners in order to enhance security capabilities at foreign airports, --assess TSA ability to enter into a mutual agreement with a foreign government entity to permit TSA representatives to conduct inspections of foreign airports without prior notice. [[Page H1969]] Through H.R. 4698: GAO will review TSA efforts to enhance security capabilities at foreign airports and secure international-inbound aviation. TSA will submit to Congress a comprehensive workforce assessment of all TSA personnel within its Office of Global Strategies or whose primary professional duties contribute to the TSA's global efforts to secure transportation security, including whether they are assigned in a risk-based, intelligence-driven matter. TSA may donate security screening equipment to a foreign last point of departure airport operator if the equipment can be expected to mitigate a specific vulnerability to U.S. security or U.S. citizens. TSA may evaluate foreign countries' air cargo programs to determine whether they provide a level of security commensurate with that required by U.S. air cargo security programs. Mr. Speaker, we cannot wait until our security is breached by terrorists before we act, otherwise we would not have learned the lessons of September 11, 2001. I urge my colleagues on the Committee to join me in supporting this important step forward to protecting our airports. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4698, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1966-H1969] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SECURING AVIATION FROM FOREIGN ENTRY POINTS AND GUARDING AIRPORTS THROUGH ENHANCED SECURITY ACT OF 2016 Mr. KATKO.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as I have come to appreciate the seriousness of the many threats facing our transportation systems, I realize that one of the most targeted and vulnerable points of attack exist for our international in-bound aviation. It is no secret that terror groups across the world value the horrific symbolism of bringing down an aircraft and are continuously plotting to take down planes. They recognize that it is easier for them to attack an aircraft destined for the United States from overseas rather than travel to the United States and then plot a domestic attack. This understanding is nothing new. My own district of Syracuse, New York, tragically learned of terrorists' determination to bring down airplanes when 35 Syracuse University students and students from other local universities, along with my close friend's sister, were killed in the Lockerbie bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988.

Mr. Speaker, we cannot wait until our security is breached by terrorists before we act, otherwise we would not have learned the lessons of September 11, 2001. I urge my colleagues on the Committee to join me in supporting this important step forward to protecting our airports. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia).

recognizes the gentleman from new york. general leave mr. katko. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new york? there was no objection. mr. katko. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, as i have come to appreciate the seriousness of the many threats facing our transportation systems, i realize that one of the most targeted and vulnerable points of attack exist for our international in-bound aviation. it is no secret that terror groups across the world value the horrific symbolism of bringing down an aircraft and are continuously plotting to take down planes. they recognize that it is easier for them to attack an aircraft destined for the united states from overseas rather than travel to the united states and then plot a domestic attack. this understanding is nothing new. my own district of syracuse, new york, tragically learned of terrorists' determination to bring down airplanes when 35 syracuse university students and students from other local universities, along with my close friend's sister, were killed in the lockerbie bombing of pan am flight 103 in 1988. now, with the horrific attacks in belgium against two transportation modes, including aviation, it has been reiterated that we must not wait for such attacks to occur in the homeland. we must be as determined to mitigate the threat as extremists are in perpetrating their attacks against us. the brussels attacks took place against the european capital with one of the explosions occurring just a few blocks from the european parliament. {time} 1700 i was near those sites not too long ago, where those explosions took place, when visiting brussels as part of a congressional delegation focused on stemming the flow of isis-affiliated foreign fighters, so i am particularly reminded of how close to home such attacks really are. while a number of security enhancements have been made in recent months by the department of homeland security, transportation security administration, and airlines, more must be done. safe gates is an important, bipartisan bill which requires tsa's office of global strategies to comprehensively assess its own mission needs, with the intent of directing resources in a more intelligence-driven, risk-based manner. further, the legislation directs tsa to provide better communication and foster stronger partnerships with foreign partners and airlines in order to make sure that everyone with a stake in securing aviation is aware of the serious threats facing our skies. lastly, the safe gates act authorizes the donation of critical security screening equipment and bolsters tsa's authority to mandate overseas cargo security standards as a means of building capacity for the security of aircraft headed for the united states. recently, our colleagues in the senate added this language to authorizing language for the federal aviation administration. during the amendment process, chairman thune of the senate commerce committee added the text of this bill, along with some additional provisions, to push tsa to work toward developing a new generation of security screening checkpoints. this provision incorporates critical stakeholder feedback by empowering the aviation security advisory committee to make recommendations to the administrator concerning checkpoints of the future. in preparation for bringing this legislation to the floor today, and in agreement with my democratic colleagues, we have added this thoughtful provision to our bill as well. i would like to thank my bipartisan cosponsor, congressman keating, for his unwavering support of this critically important legislation. moreover, i wish to thank the chairman of the full committee, mr. mccaul, and the ranking member, mr. thompson, for moving this bill through committee so we can bring our efforts to bear on the house floor today. lastly, i want to applaud chairman thune and ranking member nelson of the senate commerce committee for making sure that this bill text was added as a security provision to the senate's faa legislation, and i look forward to working closely with my senate colleagues going forward to get this legislation to the president's desk. this legislation stands as a testament to the rare ability of congress to come together in a bicameral and bipartisan manner to make the american people more secure. it also serves as a direct refute to those terrorists plotting to harm the american people, the american economy, and our right to move about freely without fear and without hindrance. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 4698, the safe gates act. mr. speaker, the legislation before us comes at a very important time. recent events have fueled increased interest in addressing terrorism threats at overseas airports. just last month, a terrorist cell carried out three simultaneous, coordinated attacks on the brussels airport and a major rail station that resulted in the death of 32 people and injuries to over 300 people. at the airport, terrorists filled large suitcases with nail bombs that were detonated in two separate explosions on the public side of the airport. this [[page h1968]] attack, in the heart of the european union's capital, underscores the reality that the aviation sector continues to be a major terrorist target. previously, in february, a terrorist boarded a commercial aircraft departing from mogadishu with a bomb concealed in a laptop. the terrorist detonated the bomb aboard the aircraft, killing himself and injuring two others. experts suggest that, had the terrorist detonated the bomb at a higher altitude, the damage to the plane would have been catastrophic and the aircraft would have been destroyed. the deadliest aviation attack in recent memory took place in october 2015, when metrojet flight 9268, departing from sharm el-sheikh international airport, was blown up over the northern sinai. this horrific tragedy resulted in the loss of 224 lives. h.r. 4698 is responsive to these devastating incidents. it focuses on last point of departure airports, or those airports that originate from foreign countries that fly to the u.s. nonstop, to airports within the u.s. h.r. 4698 requires tsa to do a security assessment of these airports and take into account: the level of coordination and cooperation between the countries in which the airports are located and tsa; the intelligence capabilities of each country; information on the numbers of known or suspected terrorists transiting through such airports; and the security screening capabilities at these airports. the legislation also requires tsa to submit a plan to bolster and enhance security collaboration between the u.s. and its foreign and domestic partners and authorizes tsa to donate security screening equipment to a foreign airport if it will reduce specific vulnerabilities to the security of the u.s. or u.s. citizens. in addition to codifying tsa's efforts to bolster security at last point of departure airports, h.r. 4698 also seeks to make enhancements to security screening at u.s. airports. specifically, it directs tsa to request that the aviation security advisory committee develop recommendations to make passenger screening processes more efficient and effective. the areas that the asac would be considering include checkpoint configuration, technology innovation, and best practices within aviation security. as the lead author of legislation authorizing the asac, i strongly believe that this body, which is composed of key stakeholders from throughout the aviation community, is a positive catalyst for improvement within tsa. mr. speaker, i close by saying that there is bipartisan support for this legislation. while on the subject of addressing overseas threats, i would note that, in recent years, dhs has made great strides in pushing the borders out, that is, identifying and stopping overseas threats before they reach our borders. congress needs to support these efforts. to that end, in the coming weeks, i will be introducing comprehensive legislation to expand and strengthen dhs' overseas program aimed at vetting and screening travelers to the u.s. my legislation, entitled pushing out america's borders act of 2016, seeks to accelerate dhs' efforts at expanding and establishing overseas posts for both cbp and ice to conduct critical traveler vetting and screening operations. with the passage of h.r. 4698 today, the house is poised to raise the level of aviation security overseas. the next challenge for this body is to support dhs in its efforts to take more proactive approaches to pushing out our nation's border security. mr. speaker, i appreciate mr. katko's cooperation in making sure that this bill was brought to the floor. we had a couple of hiccups along the way, but we worked them out. this is really how it should be done, and i appreciate the gentleman's help in getting us there. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. katko. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, the time to act is now. threats to international-bound aviation are proliferating every day, and the department of homeland security, tsa, and airlines need the adequate tools and authorities necessary to ensure the safety and security of traveling americans. without the authorities and oversight built into this legislation, i fear that congress will not be doing all it can to stay ahead of the persistent threats posed by violent extremists. we have seen the threat they pose in brussels and in last year's attacks on airliners overseas. so we must not wait to mitigate these threats until it is too late. i thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of capitol hill for working together to develop this important piece of legislation. i again urge my colleagues to support this bill. i want to thank the ranking member for his cooperation. yes, we had some hiccups, but that is part of the process. the fact of the matter is that we had a very good bill by working together and talking together. while the last colloquy on the last bill, h.r. 2820, showed we do have differences, i dare say that on the homeland security committee we have far more agreements than we have disagreements, and i hope we can continue in that manner going forward. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 4698, the ``securing aviation from foreign entry points and guarding airports through enhanced security act of 2016.'' as a senior member of the house committee on homeland security, the ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security and investigations, and a former chair of the homeland security subcommittee on transportation and security, i have been committed to protecting and improving the security of our nation's airways. the transportation security administration (tsa) needs all the support we can provide to aid them in protecting our nation against security threats. the critical work of tsa agents around the country provides security for the nation's airports, maintains a security force to screen all commercial airline passengers and baggage, and works with the transportation, law enforcement and intelligence communities to ensure safety. in 2015, tsa officers screened 708,316,339 million passengers (more than 1.9 million per day) at more than 450 airports across the nation-- which is 40,780,330 million more passengers than for the same timeframe in 2014. in addition to screening more than 708 million passengers last year, tsa officers also screened 1.6 billion carry-on bags, 432 million checked bags and 12.9 million airport employees. obtaining critical information about tsa's procedures and planning while handling enhanced security screenings throughout the country will only make us stronger and safer. the congressional district i represent in houston, texas is home to two of the world's busiest airports. the bush international and the william p. hobby airports are essential hubs for domestic and international air travel for houston and the region. nearly 40 million passengers traveled through bush international airport (iah) and an additional 10 million traveled through william p. hobby (hou). iah is the 11th busiest airport in the u.s. for total passenger traffic with more than 650 daily departures. since january, iah has seen a significant increase in both international and domestic travelers. international travel in the first half of 2015 increased by 3.9 percent compared to the same period last year. more than 5.1 million international passengers boarded flights out of iah. it is estimated that at the current rate, iah could see nearly 10.2 million international passengers by the end of the year. in october 2015, in an effort to re-establish the airport's daily international air service, the william p. hobby airport opened a new 280,000 foot complex that includes five gates for its international concourse. this addition is expected to support travel service for nearly 7,500 international passengers and 25 departing flights a day. enhanced security protects our economic interests, more importantly; implementing this bill will protect our citizens. h.r. 4698 will direct the tsa to conduct a comprehensive security risk assessment of all last point of departure airports with nonstop flights to the united states. h.r. 4698 will also require tsa to submit to congress and the government accountability office (gao) a plan to: --enhance collaboration, coordination, and information-sharing about international-inbound aviation between the united states and domestic and foreign partners in order to enhance security capabilities at foreign airports, --assess tsa ability to enter into a mutual agreement with a foreign government entity to permit tsa representatives to conduct inspections of foreign airports without prior notice. [[page h1969]] through h.r. 4698: gao will review tsa efforts to enhance security capabilities at foreign airports and secure international-inbound aviation. tsa will submit to congress a comprehensive workforce assessment of all tsa personnel within its office of global strategies or whose primary professional duties contribute to the tsa's global efforts to secure transportation security, including whether they are assigned in a risk-based, intelligence-driven matter. tsa may donate security screening equipment to a foreign last point of departure airport operator if the equipment can be expected to mitigate a specific vulnerability to u.s. security or u.s. citizens. tsa may evaluate foreign countries' air cargo programs to determine whether they provide a level of security commensurate with that required by u.s. air cargo security programs. mr. speaker, we cannot wait until our security is breached by terrorists before we act, otherwise we would not have learned the lessons of september 11, 2001. i urge my colleagues on the committee to join me in supporting this important step forward to protecting our airports. the speaker pro tempore (mr. jody b. hice of georgia). the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from new york (mr. katko) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 4698, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",25427

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. General Leave Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3583, the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies, or PREPARE Act, which I introduced during my tenure as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. The PREPARE Act is part of the Committee on Homeland Security's effort to authorize and ensure the efficiency of the Department of Homeland Security's operations. The provisions of this bill were informed by the subcommittee's oversight this Congress and discussions with stakeholders. This was a bipartisan process, and I am pleased that the subcommittee's ranking member, Congressman Payne, joined me in sponsoring this bill. This bill is an example of how we should be working together in Congress to get things done. The PREPARE Act makes a number of improvements to the operations at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Office of Health Affairs, and Office of Emergency Communications. The bill authorizes, for the first time, Operation Stonegarden, which provides grants to law enforcement agencies along the border to enhance border security. These funds are vital to the security of border communities, like the ones in my district in southern Arizona. We must ensure that grant programs like the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative are providing a return on investment and assisting in the closure of capability gaps. That is why the bill requires FEMA to analyze data included in yearly State Preparedness Reports and Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessments to gauge year-over-year improvements. The bill also requires FEMA to share information on grants management best practices with grant recipients so that they may benefit from innovative practices used by other grantees. In addition, the bill sets the period of performance for these grant programs at 3 years, to ensure grant recipients have sufficient time to make sound investments. To ensure FEMA is operating efficiently and effectively, the bill requires the Administrator to designate an individual to serve as FEMA's chief management official and take steps to address the findings and recommendations of a number of GAO reports. The bill also requires FEMA to update its strategic human capital plan so it has the workforce it needs to complete its important mission. It is vital that our Nation's first responders have the tools that they need to communicate. That is why the bill seeks to ensure that the First Responder Network Authority and the Department of Homeland Security work together to secure the nationwide public safety broadband network that is under development against cyberattacks. After hearing much concern from first responders who rely on the technical assistance and programming of the Office of Emergency Communication, the bill prohibits the Secretary of Homeland Security from reorganizing OEC without prior authorization. {time} 1715 A 2015 GAO review of interoperability at the Department noted that CBP and ICE personnel reported the lack of interoperability along the border resulted in missed apprehensions and jeopardized agent safety. As a result, the bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that DHS' radio users, such as Border Patrol agents, CBP officers, and ICE agents receive ongoing training on the use of radio systems, including interagency radio use protocols. This provision builds upon legislation signed into the law by the President that requires DHS to develop a strategy to achieve and maintain interoperability among its components. To address the chemical and biological threats we face, the PREPARE Act authorizes responsibilities of the Department's Chief Medical Officer and establishes a pilot program to provide anthrax vaccines to first responders on a voluntary basis. I want to thank my successor, Chairman Donovan, for his leadership in continuing to shepherd the PREPARE Act to the floor today. I would also like to thank Chairman Shuster, Chairman Upton, and Chairman Hensarling for working with us to advance this bill. Mr. Speaker, the PREPARE Act builds efficiencies and increases coordination for preparedness improvements while providing greater accountability for taxpayers. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

McCaul, Chairman. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3853, the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3583, the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act, also known as the PREPARE Act. Before I begin, I would like to commend former Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee Chairperson McSally and Ranking Member Payne, Jr., for their close collaboration in developing this legislation. H.R. 3583 is the product of extensive bipartisan oversight carried out by the subcommittee and will make communities better prepared to respond to manmade and natural disasters. In particular, this measure makes a number of improvements related to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's administration of the Homeland Security Grant Program, authorizes activities of the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium and the Rural Domestic Preparedness Consortium, and addresses ongoing interoperability challenges both within the Department of Homeland Security and the State and local level. A provision I authored at the full committee to improve the Homeland Security Grant Program is also included. That provision directs FEMA to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the DHS' Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties regarding policy and guidance in the Urban Areas Security Initiative and the State Homeland Security Grant Program. Under current grant guidance, grantees are permitted to use funding for activities related to countering violent extremism. By requiring FEMA to consult with DHS' Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in developing its grant guidance related to CVE, we will ensure that the activities carried out by the grantees do not target ordinary citizens simply because of their religion or ethnic background. Additionally, to address shortcomings of the National Incident Management System, commonly called NIMS, revealed at a series of full committee hearings examining the heroic response of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, the committee accepted an amendment I authored requiring FEMA to review and revise NIMS once every 5 years. Regular review of NIMS will ensure that its protocols are responsive to the current threat environment, incident management requirements, and lessons learned from previous incidents. Finally, the bill includes important provisions to improve Federal interoperable communications capabilities added by Subcommittee Ranking Member Payne, Jr. To improve interoperable communications on the State and local level, H.R. 3583 includes Mr. Payne's Statewide Interoperable Communications Act, which facilitates coordination of emergency communication purchases and policies within a State. The bill also addresses interoperability challenges at DHS by requiring that the Undersecretary for Management verify that all radio users at the Department receive initial and ongoing training in the use of DHS' radio systems. I commend Ranking Member Payne, Jr., on his work on the bill and his ongoing efforts to address the interoperability challenges that continue to hamstring Federal, State, and local first responders. H.R. 3583 will go far in helping first responders do their job better and safer [[Page H1976]] and will make our communities better prepared and more resilient. I urge my colleagues to support the PREPARE Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman McSally for yielding. As chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3583, the PREPARE Act, of which I am pleased to be an original sponsor. Introduced by the subcommittee's former Chairwoman, Representative McSally, the PREPARE Act seeks to enhance accountability at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Office of Emergency Communications, and Office of Health Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security. The Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee is fortunate to work with a very engaged stakeholder community, and many of the provisions of this bill were formed through hearings, briefings, and meetings with those stakeholders. For example, the bill sets the period of performance for a number of grant programs at 3 years. We heard from numerous stakeholder groups that FEMA's reduction of the period of performance from 3 years to 2 years inhibited their ability to make meaningful grant investments. I am pleased that FEMA has changed the period of performance back to 3 years, and the PREPARE Act codifies that timeline. The PREPARE Act prohibits FEMA from implementing its National Preparedness Grant Program proposal, which was widely opposed by first responders. It seeks to ensure greater outreach by the Department to law enforcement agencies through the Office of State and local law enforcement. It prohibits the Undersecretary of National Protection and Programs Directorate from reorganizing or changing the location of the Office of Emergency Communications without authorization of Congress. Stakeholder groups such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Association of Fire Chiefs, Major Cities Chiefs, and National Sheriffs' Association have expressed their great concern about the impact this proposed reorganization would have on the Office of Emergency Communications and its work with first responders to achieve and maintain interoperability communications. It authorizes the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, which provides vital training for first responders, and it authorizes a voluntary anthrax vaccination program for first responders to help protect those who protect us. The PREPARE Act also includes flood insurance provisions of great importance to my constituents. Superstorm Sandy devastated Staten Island and South Brooklyn 3\1/2\ years ago, claiming dozens of lives and destroying thousands of homes. Unfortunately, since then, my constituents have gone through the storm after the storm. Damage inspectors shamelessly doctored their reports to blame pre-existing conditions for Sandy's destruction, cheating Sandy victims out of insurance proceedings they rightfully deserved. By applying lessons learned in the aftermath of that fateful day, title V of the PREPARE Act will make two important improvements to the National Flood Insurance Program. First, this legislation will empower and protect policyholders by requiring engineers and inspectors employed to assess flood insurance claims to provide policyholders with copies of the reports listing flood damage to their homes. This will prevent fraud and increase efficiency and transparency by giving policyholders more information about their claims at a critical stage in the process. Second, this legislation will improve the flood insurance claims appeal process by fixing an archaic and confusing court filing deadline that prevents policyholders from using the FEMA appeals process for fear of missing their opportunity to seek relief in Federal court. The bill will set a firm start date for the claim's statute of limitations and pause the statute of limitations while policyholders pursue their appeal at the agency level. Ultimately, this legislation will reduce costly litigation, saving taxpayers and policyholders money. I am pleased to work with Chairwoman McSally and Ranking Member Payne on this bipartisan legislation. I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their leadership in moving it forward. I would particularly like to thank Chairman Hensarling and Subcommittee Chairman Luetkemeyer of the Financial Services Committee for working with me to advance the flood insurance process reforms in this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 3583. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3583 seeks to resolve gaps in the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to build State and local capabilities to prevent, protect against, and respond to manmade and natural disasters. Again, this bipartisan legislation is a product of careful oversight and significant stakeholder outreach. I urge my colleagues to support the PREPARE Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3583. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act (PREPARE Act/H.R. 3583). In addition to enhancing accountability at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Office of Emergency Communications, and the Office of Health Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), this legislation makes critical reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP) claims process. Nearly three and a half years have passed since Superstorm Sandy devastated New Jersey, New York, and other parts of the Northeast, yet thousands of victims are still fighting for fair and equitable treatment from the NFIP. Following Sandy, these homeowners were further victimized by the unconscionable misconduct of certain insurance companies and engineering firms who defrauded them, all of which was enabled by FEMA's inadequate control and oversight. The Sandy Claims Review Process was launched after my colleagues and I pushed FEMA to reopen a robust and thorough claims process to review all potential Sandy-related underpayments. To date, over 19,000 NFIP policyholders have entered the review process. More than 7,000 policyholders have been offered additional claims payments, with over $46 million in actual payments made and over $89 million in proposed payments. Homeowners who pursued litigation outside of the claims process have received nearly $160 million in settlements. Those who dutifully paid their premiums with the expectation that the NFIP would be there following a disaster deserve every penny owed to them. The tens of millions of dollars paid out thus far should have been in the hands of policyholders years ago. These homeowners were betrayed following Sandy, and reforms are necessary to restore consumer trust and taxpayer confidence in the NFIP. In a report released last month, the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that FEMA does not provide adequate oversight of its NFIP Write Your Own (WYO) Program. As a result, FEMA ``is unable to ensure that WYO companies are properly implementing the NFIP and is unable to identify systemic problems in the program. Furthermore, without adequate internal controls in place, FEMA's NFIP funds may be at risk for fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement.'' Of particular concern are altered or falsified engineering reports that resulted in dramatically lower claim payments for Sandy victims. Last year, 60 Minutes' ``The Storm after the Storm'' reported on allegations of engineering reports receiving drastic alterations after being submitted to the insurer by the on-site engineer inspector. FEMA's then-Deputy Associate Administrator for Insurance told 60 Minutes that he was not going to ``conceal that fact that it happened. Because in the last three weeks, I've seen evidence of it.'' This was subsequently confirmed in delegation briefings I hosted with FEMA. [[Page H1977]] Title V of the PREPARE Act will require any final engineering reports and/or claims adjustment reports--certified and free of alterations--to be provided to the policyholder first, before any employer or agency. It also amends the claims appeal process to provide policyholders with more time to consider legal remedies. Together these provisions will help reform a fundamentally broken system and provide policyholders with the transparency and fairness they are entitled to throughout the NFIP claims process. FEMA must deliver on its promises. That begins with the completion of the ongoing Sandy Claims Review Process and a resolution to Sandy- related litigation. Every suspected instance of fraud must be investigated and bad actors must be expelled. FEMA must closely monitor the performance of specific inspectors and adjustors that may not be illegal, but simply shoddy and incompetent. The NFIP Transformation Task Force must continue its implementation of OIG's seven recommendations to improve its oversight. Together with the PREPARE Act, these actions can restore accountability and ensure lasting reform. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3583, the ``Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act,'' also known as the ``PREPARE Act.'' I became Ranking Member of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee in the beginning of 2013. I took on that position because I represent the 10th Congressional of New Jersey, which according to the New York Times, encompasses the two most dangerous miles in America. From major mass transit arteries and chemical facilities to homes and schools, my district is vulnerable to a variety of man-made and natural disasters. Our community's first responders must be prepared to respond to every worst-case scenario. That is why I was proud to work with Ms. McSally to author the ``PREPARE Act.'' In my capacity as Ranking Member of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity to hear from first responders and emergency managers across the country, as well as doctors, public health experts, and individuals advocating to ensure the needs of children are incorporated into disaster response plans. I am pleased to say that H.R. 3583 is responsive to the calls to action we have heard on the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee. For example, the Subcommittee has conducted extensive oversight of progress related to interoperable communications, and we have learned that the important governance structures--developed with support of the Interoperable Emergency Communications Grant Program--have suffered since the program was eliminated in 2011. To preserve the progress States have made on emergency communications planning and coordination, H.R. 3583 includes my Statewide Interoperable Communications Enhancement Act, which passed the House as a stand-alone measure in July. H.R. 3583 also includes language I offered to address communications training gaps at DHS by requiring all radio users to receive initial and ongoing training consistent with the DHS Interoperable Communications Strategy, which was required under legislation I wrote last year. The ``PREPARE Act'' also makes important progress in the area of biopreparedness, particularly related to improving how DHS manages its medical countermeasures program and establishing a voluntary anthrax vaccination program for first responders. To address concerns the Subcommittee heard from organizations like Save the Children related to the unique needs of children during disasters, the Committee accepted an amendment I offered directing FEMA to appoint a technical expert to ensure that children are incorporated into disaster preparedness, planning, response, and recovery activities. As the father of triplets, I have worked hard to improve the way the Federal government helps schools keep children safe during disasters and to address gaps in disaster planning that affect children. I appreciate the Committee's support for my efforts to ensure H.R. 3583 improves the way the needs of children are integrated into emergency planning. Finally, the bill guarantees homeland security grant program recipients three years to use their grant funds, which will help ensure that limited funds are spent effectively and deliberately. H.R. 3583 also includes common-sense provisions requiring grantees to have maintenance plans in place before using Federal money to procure important emergency response equipment, directing FEMA to include grant management best practices in its annual Notice of Funding Opportunity, and charging FEMA to provide information to Congress on how grant funds are closing capability gaps. On the subject of the Homeland Security Grant Program, I would like to once again, on the record, voice my opposition to the funding cuts proposed in the President's FY 2017 budget request. First responders across the country have made clear over and over again that these important grant dollars are critical to building and maintaining preparedness and response capabilities. State and local governments are already struggling to absorb cuts to homeland security grant funding that have occurred over the last decade, and every first responder I have spoken to tells me that planning, training, and exercise opportunities would further suffer with more cuts. I urge appropriators to reject the proposed funding cuts and to provide additional funding to these grant programs. Before I conclude, I would like to congratulate the former Subcommittee Chairman McSally on bringing this legislation to the floor, and I thank her for working with me as she developed the bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3583. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee and Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I rise in support of H.R. 3583, the PREPARE Act, a bill that provides an important additional tool in preparing for attacks and responding to emergencies. I support this legislation, because it requires multiple emergency agencies to coordinate and improve overall preparedness for attacks and emergencies. Specifically, H.R. 3583 amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Federal Emergency management Agency (FEMA) to enter into memoranda of understanding with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Office of Emergency Communication (OEC), the Office for State and Local Law Enforcement, the Countering Violent Extremism Coordinator, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and other Department of Homeland Security offices and components to delineate their responsibilities for awarding grants to: Public Transportation Agencies to improve security under Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. High-risk urban areas and state, local, and tribal governments to protect against terrorism under the UASI and the State Homeland Security Grant Program. Implementation of Area Maritime Transportation Security Plans and facility security plans, provide port security services, and train law enforcement personnel. The PREPARE Act is a smart bill that will enable the Department of Homeland Security to establish a social media working group to identify and provide guidance and best practices for the emergency preparedness and response community. The social media group will submit an annual report that includes: A review and analysis of social media technologies used to support preparedness, response, and recovery activities. A review of best practices and lessons learned. Recommendations to improve DHS's use of social media technologies for emergency management purposes. Recommendations to improve public awareness of the type of information disseminated through such technologies, and recommendations on how to access such information during emergencies. A review of available training for government officials. A review of coordination efforts with the private sector to discuss and resolve legal, operational, technical, privacy, and security concerns. In today's increasingly advanced and complex technology, social media is easily and heavily utilized by terrorists as a dangerous recruiting tool. Mr. Speaker, the PREPARE Act will equip the Department of Homeland Security with vital tools and resources to prevent and remove social media threats and recruitment tactics implemented by terrorist groups. The PREPARE Act will further require FEMA to integrate the needs of children into its activities to protect against natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters, including by appointing a technical expert to coordinate such activities. This is a comprehensive bill that will protect all Americans in every corner of this nation. I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 3583. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3583, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the [[Page H1978]] rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1969-H1978] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROMOTING RESILIENCE AND EFFICIENCY IN PREPARING FOR ATTACKS AND RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES ACT Ms. McSALLY.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. General Leave Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3583, the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies, or PREPARE Act, which I introduced during my tenure as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. The PREPARE Act is part of the Committee on Homeland Security's effort to authorize and ensure the efficiency of the Department of Homeland Security's operations. The provisions of this bill were informed by the subcommittee's oversight this Congress and discussions with stakeholders. This was a bipartisan process, and I am pleased that the subcommittee's ranking member, Congressman Payne, joined me in sponsoring this bill. This bill is an example of how we should be working together in Congress to get things done. The PREPARE Act makes a number of improvements to the operations at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Office of Health Affairs, and Office of Emergency Communications. The bill authorizes, for the first time, Operation Stonegarden, which provides grants to law enforcement agencies along the border to enhance border security. These funds are vital to the security of border communities, like the ones in my district in southern Arizona. We must ensure that grant programs like the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative are providing a return on investment and assisting in the closure of capability gaps. That is why the bill requires FEMA to analyze data included in yearly State Preparedness Reports and Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessments to gauge year-over-year improvements. The bill also requires FEMA to share information on grants management best practices with grant recipients so that they may benefit from innovative practices used by other grantees. In addition, the bill sets the period of performance for these grant programs at 3 years, to ensure grant recipients have sufficient time to make sound investments. To ensure FEMA is operating efficiently and effectively, the bill requires the Administrator to designate an individual to serve as FEMA's chief management official and take steps to address the findings and recommendations of a number of GAO reports. The bill also requires FEMA to update its strategic human capital plan so it has the workforce it needs to complete its important mission. It is vital that our Nation's first responders have the tools that they need to communicate. That is why the bill seeks to ensure that the First Responder Network Authority and the Department of Homeland Security work together to secure the nationwide public safety broadband network that is under development against cyberattacks. After hearing much concern from first responders who rely on the technical assistance and programming of the Office of Emergency Communication, the bill prohibits the Secretary of Homeland Security from reorganizing OEC without prior authorization. {time} 1715 A 2015 GAO review of interoperability at the Department noted that CBP and ICE personnel reported the lack of interoperability along the border resulted in missed apprehensions and jeopardized agent safety. As a result, the bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that DHS' radio users, such as Border Patrol agents, CBP officers, and ICE agents receive ongoing training on the use of radio systems, including interagency radio use protocols. This provision builds upon legislation signed into the law by the President that requires DHS to develop a strategy to achieve and maintain interoperability among its components. To address the chemical and biological threats we face, the PREPARE Act authorizes responsibilities of the Department's Chief Medical Officer and establishes a pilot program to provide anthrax vaccines to first responders on a voluntary basis. I want to thank my successor, Chairman Donovan, for his leadership in continuing to shepherd the PREPARE Act to the floor today. I would also like to thank Chairman Shuster, Chairman Upton, and Chairman Hensarling for working with us to advance this bill. Mr. Speaker, the PREPARE Act builds efficiencies and increases coordination for preparedness improvements while providing greater accountability for taxpayers. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

McCaul, Chairman. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3853, the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3583, the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act, also known as the PREPARE Act. Before I begin, I would like to commend former Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee Chairperson McSally and Ranking Member Payne, Jr., for their close collaboration in developing this legislation. H.R. 3583 is the product of extensive bipartisan oversight carried out by the subcommittee and will make communities better prepared to respond to manmade and natural disasters. In particular, this measure makes a number of improvements related to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's administration of the Homeland Security Grant Program, authorizes activities of the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium and the Rural Domestic Preparedness Consortium, and addresses ongoing interoperability challenges both within the Department of Homeland Security and the State and local level. A provision I authored at the full committee to improve the Homeland Security Grant Program is also included. That provision directs FEMA to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the DHS' Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties regarding policy and guidance in the Urban Areas Security Initiative and the State Homeland Security Grant Program. Under current grant guidance, grantees are permitted to use funding for activities related to countering violent extremism. By requiring FEMA to consult with DHS' Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in developing its grant guidance related to CVE, we will ensure that the activities carried out by the grantees do not target ordinary citizens simply because of their religion or ethnic background. Additionally, to address shortcomings of the National Incident Management System, commonly called NIMS, revealed at a series of full committee hearings examining the heroic response of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, the committee accepted an amendment I authored requiring FEMA to review and revise NIMS once every 5 years. Regular review of NIMS will ensure that its protocols are responsive to the current threat environment, incident management requirements, and lessons learned from previous incidents. Finally, the bill includes important provisions to improve Federal interoperable communications capabilities added by Subcommittee Ranking Member Payne, Jr. To improve interoperable communications on the State and local level, H.R. 3583 includes Mr. Payne's Statewide Interoperable Communications Act, which facilitates coordination of emergency communication purchases and policies within a State. The bill also addresses interoperability challenges at DHS by requiring that the Undersecretary for Management verify that all radio users at the Department receive initial and ongoing training in the use of DHS' radio systems. I commend Ranking Member Payne, Jr., on his work on the bill and his ongoing efforts to address the interoperability challenges that continue to hamstring Federal, State, and local first responders. H.R. 3583 will go far in helping first responders do their job better and safer [[Page H1976]] and will make our communities better prepared and more resilient. I urge my colleagues to support the PREPARE Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman McSally for yielding. As chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3583, the PREPARE Act, of which I am pleased to be an original sponsor. Introduced by the subcommittee's former Chairwoman, Representative McSally, the PREPARE Act seeks to enhance accountability at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Office of Emergency Communications, and Office of Health Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security. The Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee is fortunate to work with a very engaged stakeholder community, and many of the provisions of this bill were formed through hearings, briefings, and meetings with those stakeholders. For example, the bill sets the period of performance for a number of grant programs at 3 years. We heard from numerous stakeholder groups that FEMA's reduction of the period of performance from 3 years to 2 years inhibited their ability to make meaningful grant investments. I am pleased that FEMA has changed the period of performance back to 3 years, and the PREPARE Act codifies that timeline. The PREPARE Act prohibits FEMA from implementing its National Preparedness Grant Program proposal, which was widely opposed by first responders. It seeks to ensure greater outreach by the Department to law enforcement agencies through the Office of State and local law enforcement. It prohibits the Undersecretary of National Protection and Programs Directorate from reorganizing or changing the location of the Office of Emergency Communications without authorization of Congress. Stakeholder groups such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Association of Fire Chiefs, Major Cities Chiefs, and National Sheriffs' Association have expressed their great concern about the impact this proposed reorganization would have on the Office of Emergency Communications and its work with first responders to achieve and maintain interoperability communications. It authorizes the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, which provides vital training for first responders, and it authorizes a voluntary anthrax vaccination program for first responders to help protect those who protect us. The PREPARE Act also includes flood insurance provisions of great importance to my constituents. Superstorm Sandy devastated Staten Island and South Brooklyn 3\1/2\ years ago, claiming dozens of lives and destroying thousands of homes. Unfortunately, since then, my constituents have gone through the storm after the storm. Damage inspectors shamelessly doctored their reports to blame pre-existing conditions for Sandy's destruction, cheating Sandy victims out of insurance proceedings they rightfully deserved. By applying lessons learned in the aftermath of that fateful day, title V of the PREPARE Act will make two important improvements to the National Flood Insurance Program. First, this legislation will empower and protect policyholders by requiring engineers and inspectors employed to assess flood insurance claims to provide policyholders with copies of the reports listing flood damage to their homes. This will prevent fraud and increase efficiency and transparency by giving policyholders more information about their claims at a critical stage in the process. Second, this legislation will improve the flood insurance claims appeal process by fixing an archaic and confusing court filing deadline that prevents policyholders from using the FEMA appeals process for fear of missing their opportunity to seek relief in Federal court. The bill will set a firm start date for the claim's statute of limitations and pause the statute of limitations while policyholders pursue their appeal at the agency level. Ultimately, this legislation will reduce costly litigation, saving taxpayers and policyholders money. I am pleased to work with Chairwoman McSally and Ranking Member Payne on this bipartisan legislation. I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their leadership in moving it forward. I would particularly like to thank Chairman Hensarling and Subcommittee Chairman Luetkemeyer of the Financial Services Committee for working with me to advance the flood insurance process reforms in this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 3583. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3583 seeks to resolve gaps in the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to build State and local capabilities to prevent, protect against, and respond to manmade and natural disasters. Again, this bipartisan legislation is a product of careful oversight and significant stakeholder outreach. I urge my colleagues to support the PREPARE Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3583. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act (PREPARE Act/H.R. 3583). In addition to enhancing accountability at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Office of Emergency Communications, and the Office of Health Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), this legislation makes critical reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP) claims process. Nearly three and a half years have passed since Superstorm Sandy devastated New Jersey, New York, and other parts of the Northeast, yet thousands of victims are still fighting for fair and equitable treatment from the NFIP. Following Sandy, these homeowners were further victimized by the unconscionable misconduct of certain insurance companies and engineering firms who defrauded them, all of which was enabled by FEMA's inadequate control and oversight. The Sandy Claims Review Process was launched after my colleagues and I pushed FEMA to reopen a robust and thorough claims process to review all potential Sandy-related underpayments. To date, over 19,000 NFIP policyholders have entered the review process. More than 7,000 policyholders have been offered additional claims payments, with over $46 million in actual payments made and over $89 million in proposed payments. Homeowners who pursued litigation outside of the claims process have received nearly $160 million in settlements. Those who dutifully paid their premiums with the expectation that the NFIP would be there following a disaster deserve every penny owed to them. The tens of millions of dollars paid out thus far should have been in the hands of policyholders years ago. These homeowners were betrayed following Sandy, and reforms are necessary to restore consumer trust and taxpayer confidence in the NFIP. In a report released last month, the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that FEMA does not provide adequate oversight of its NFIP Write Your Own (WYO) Program. As a result, FEMA ``is unable to ensure that WYO companies are properly implementing the NFIP and is unable to identify systemic problems in the program. Furthermore, without adequate internal controls in place, FEMA's NFIP funds may be at risk for fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement.'' Of particular concern are altered or falsified engineering reports that resulted in dramatically lower claim payments for Sandy victims. Last year, 60 Minutes' ``The Storm after the Storm'' reported on allegations of engineering reports receiving drastic alterations after being submitted to the insurer by the on-site engineer inspector. FEMA's then-Deputy Associate Administrator for Insurance told 60 Minutes that he was not going to ``conceal that fact that it happened. Because in the last three weeks, I've seen evidence of it.'' This was subsequently confirmed in delegation briefings I hosted with FEMA. [[Page H1977]] Title V of the PREPARE Act will require any final engineering reports and/or claims adjustment reports--certified and free of alterations--to be provided to the policyholder first, before any employer or agency. It also amends the claims appeal process to provide policyholders with more time to consider legal remedies. Together these provisions will help reform a fundamentally broken system and provide policyholders with the transparency and fairness they are entitled to throughout the NFIP claims process. FEMA must deliver on its promises. That begins with the completion of the ongoing Sandy Claims Review Process and a resolution to Sandy- related litigation. Every suspected instance of fraud must be investigated and bad actors must be expelled. FEMA must closely monitor the performance of specific inspectors and adjustors that may not be illegal, but simply shoddy and incompetent. The NFIP Transformation Task Force must continue its implementation of OIG's seven recommendations to improve its oversight. Together with the PREPARE Act, these actions can restore accountability and ensure lasting reform. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3583, the ``Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act,'' also known as the ``PREPARE Act.'' I became Ranking Member of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee in the beginning of 2013. I took on that position because I represent the 10th Congressional of New Jersey, which according to the New York Times, encompasses the two most dangerous miles in America. From major mass transit arteries and chemical facilities to homes and schools, my district is vulnerable to a variety of man-made and natural disasters. Our community's first responders must be prepared to respond to every worst-case scenario. That is why I was proud to work with Ms. McSally to author the ``PREPARE Act.'' In my capacity as Ranking Member of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity to hear from first responders and emergency managers across the country, as well as doctors, public health experts, and individuals advocating to ensure the needs of children are incorporated into disaster response plans. I am pleased to say that H.R. 3583 is responsive to the calls to action we have heard on the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee. For example, the Subcommittee has conducted extensive oversight of progress related to interoperable communications, and we have learned that the important governance structures--developed with support of the Interoperable Emergency Communications Grant Program--have suffered since the program was eliminated in 2011. To preserve the progress States have made on emergency communications planning and coordination, H.R. 3583 includes my Statewide Interoperable Communications Enhancement Act, which passed the House as a stand-alone measure in July. H.R. 3583 also includes language I offered to address communications training gaps at DHS by requiring all radio users to receive initial and ongoing training consistent with the DHS Interoperable Communications Strategy, which was required under legislation I wrote last year. The ``PREPARE Act'' also makes important progress in the area of biopreparedness, particularly related to improving how DHS manages its medical countermeasures program and establishing a voluntary anthrax vaccination program for first responders. To address concerns the Subcommittee heard from organizations like Save the Children related to the unique needs of children during disasters, the Committee accepted an amendment I offered directing FEMA to appoint a technical expert to ensure that children are incorporated into disaster preparedness, planning, response, and recovery activities. As the father of triplets, I have worked hard to improve the way the Federal government helps schools keep children safe during disasters and to address gaps in disaster planning that affect children. I appreciate the Committee's support for my efforts to ensure H.R. 3583 improves the way the needs of children are integrated into emergency planning. Finally, the bill guarantees homeland security grant program recipients three years to use their grant funds, which will help ensure that limited funds are spent effectively and deliberately. H.R. 3583 also includes common-sense provisions requiring grantees to have maintenance plans in place before using Federal money to procure important emergency response equipment, directing FEMA to include grant management best practices in its annual Notice of Funding Opportunity, and charging FEMA to provide information to Congress on how grant funds are closing capability gaps. On the subject of the Homeland Security Grant Program, I would like to once again, on the record, voice my opposition to the funding cuts proposed in the President's FY 2017 budget request. First responders across the country have made clear over and over again that these important grant dollars are critical to building and maintaining preparedness and response capabilities. State and local governments are already struggling to absorb cuts to homeland security grant funding that have occurred over the last decade, and every first responder I have spoken to tells me that planning, training, and exercise opportunities would further suffer with more cuts. I urge appropriators to reject the proposed funding cuts and to provide additional funding to these grant programs. Before I conclude, I would like to congratulate the former Subcommittee Chairman McSally on bringing this legislation to the floor, and I thank her for working with me as she developed the bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3583. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee and Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I rise in support of H.R. 3583, the PREPARE Act, a bill that provides an important additional tool in preparing for attacks and responding to emergencies. I support this legislation, because it requires multiple emergency agencies to coordinate and improve overall preparedness for attacks and emergencies. Specifically, H.R. 3583 amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Federal Emergency management Agency (FEMA) to enter into memoranda of understanding with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Office of Emergency Communication (OEC), the Office for State and Local Law Enforcement, the Countering Violent Extremism Coordinator, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and other Department of Homeland Security offices and components to delineate their responsibilities for awarding grants to: Public Transportation Agencies to improve security under Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. High-risk urban areas and state, local, and tribal governments to protect against terrorism under the UASI and the State Homeland Security Grant Program. Implementation of Area Maritime Transportation Security Plans and facility security plans, provide port security services, and train law enforcement personnel. The PREPARE Act is a smart bill that will enable the Department of Homeland Security to establish a social media working group to identify and provide guidance and best practices for the emergency preparedness and response community. The social media group will submit an annual report that includes: A review and analysis of social media technologies used to support preparedness, response, and recovery activities. A review of best practices and lessons learned. Recommendations to improve DHS's use of social media technologies for emergency management purposes. Recommendations to improve public awareness of the type of information disseminated through such technologies, and recommendations on how to access such information during emergencies. A review of available training for government officials. A review of coordination efforts with the private sector to discuss and resolve legal, operational, technical, privacy, and security concerns. In today's increasingly advanced and complex technology, social media is easily and heavily utilized by terrorists as a dangerous recruiting tool. Mr. Speaker, the PREPARE Act will equip the Department of Homeland Security with vital tools and resources to prevent and remove social media threats and recruitment tactics implemented by terrorist groups. The PREPARE Act will further require FEMA to integrate the needs of children into its activities to protect against natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters, including by appointing a technical expert to coordinate such activities. This is a comprehensive bill that will protect all Americans in every corner of this nation. I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 3583. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3583, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the [[Page H1978]] rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1969-H1978] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROMOTING RESILIENCE AND EFFICIENCY IN PREPARING FOR ATTACKS AND RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES ACT Ms. McSALLY.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. General Leave Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3583, the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies, or PREPARE Act, which I introduced during my tenure as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. The PREPARE Act is part of the Committee on Homeland Security's effort to authorize and ensure the efficiency of the Department of Homeland Security's operations. The provisions of this bill were informed by the subcommittee's oversight this Congress and discussions with stakeholders. This was a bipartisan process, and I am pleased that the subcommittee's ranking member, Congressman Payne, joined me in sponsoring this bill. This bill is an example of how we should be working together in Congress to get things done. The PREPARE Act makes a number of improvements to the operations at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Office of Health Affairs, and Office of Emergency Communications. The bill authorizes, for the first time, Operation Stonegarden, which provides grants to law enforcement agencies along the border to enhance border security. These funds are vital to the security of border communities, like the ones in my district in southern Arizona. We must ensure that grant programs like the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative are providing a return on investment and assisting in the closure of capability gaps. That is why the bill requires FEMA to analyze data included in yearly State Preparedness Reports and Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessments to gauge year-over-year improvements. The bill also requires FEMA to share information on grants management best practices with grant recipients so that they may benefit from innovative practices used by other grantees. In addition, the bill sets the period of performance for these grant programs at 3 years, to ensure grant recipients have sufficient time to make sound investments. To ensure FEMA is operating efficiently and effectively, the bill requires the Administrator to designate an individual to serve as FEMA's chief management official and take steps to address the findings and recommendations of a number of GAO reports. The bill also requires FEMA to update its strategic human capital plan so it has the workforce it needs to complete its important mission. It is vital that our Nation's first responders have the tools that they need to communicate. That is why the bill seeks to ensure that the First Responder Network Authority and the Department of Homeland Security work together to secure the nationwide public safety broadband network that is under development against cyberattacks. After hearing much concern from first responders who rely on the technical assistance and programming of the Office of Emergency Communication, the bill prohibits the Secretary of Homeland Security from reorganizing OEC without prior authorization. {time} 1715 A 2015 GAO review of interoperability at the Department noted that CBP and ICE personnel reported the lack of interoperability along the border resulted in missed apprehensions and jeopardized agent safety. As a result, the bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that DHS' radio users, such as Border Patrol agents, CBP officers, and ICE agents receive ongoing training on the use of radio systems, including interagency radio use protocols. This provision builds upon legislation signed into the law by the President that requires DHS to develop a strategy to achieve and maintain interoperability among its components. To address the chemical and biological threats we face, the PREPARE Act authorizes responsibilities of the Department's Chief Medical Officer and establishes a pilot program to provide anthrax vaccines to first responders on a voluntary basis. I want to thank my successor, Chairman Donovan, for his leadership in continuing to shepherd the PREPARE Act to the floor today. I would also like to thank Chairman Shuster, Chairman Upton, and Chairman Hensarling for working with us to advance this bill. Mr. Speaker, the PREPARE Act builds efficiencies and increases coordination for preparedness improvements while providing greater accountability for taxpayers. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

McCaul, Chairman. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3853, the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3583, the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act, also known as the PREPARE Act. Before I begin, I would like to commend former Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee Chairperson McSally and Ranking Member Payne, Jr., for their close collaboration in developing this legislation. H.R. 3583 is the product of extensive bipartisan oversight carried out by the subcommittee and will make communities better prepared to respond to manmade and natural disasters. In particular, this measure makes a number of improvements related to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's administration of the Homeland Security Grant Program, authorizes activities of the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium and the Rural Domestic Preparedness Consortium, and addresses ongoing interoperability challenges both within the Department of Homeland Security and the State and local level. A provision I authored at the full committee to improve the Homeland Security Grant Program is also included. That provision directs FEMA to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the DHS' Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties regarding policy and guidance in the Urban Areas Security Initiative and the State Homeland Security Grant Program. Under current grant guidance, grantees are permitted to use funding for activities related to countering violent extremism. By requiring FEMA to consult with DHS' Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in developing its grant guidance related to CVE, we will ensure that the activities carried out by the grantees do not target ordinary citizens simply because of their religion or ethnic background. Additionally, to address shortcomings of the National Incident Management System, commonly called NIMS, revealed at a series of full committee hearings examining the heroic response of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, the committee accepted an amendment I authored requiring FEMA to review and revise NIMS once every 5 years. Regular review of NIMS will ensure that its protocols are responsive to the current threat environment, incident management requirements, and lessons learned from previous incidents. Finally, the bill includes important provisions to improve Federal interoperable communications capabilities added by Subcommittee Ranking Member Payne, Jr. To improve interoperable communications on the State and local level, H.R. 3583 includes Mr. Payne's Statewide Interoperable Communications Act, which facilitates coordination of emergency communication purchases and policies within a State. The bill also addresses interoperability challenges at DHS by requiring that the Undersecretary for Management verify that all radio users at the Department receive initial and ongoing training in the use of DHS' radio systems. I commend Ranking Member Payne, Jr., on his work on the bill and his ongoing efforts to address the interoperability challenges that continue to hamstring Federal, State, and local first responders. H.R. 3583 will go far in helping first responders do their job better and safer [[Page H1976]] and will make our communities better prepared and more resilient. I urge my colleagues to support the PREPARE Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman McSally for yielding. As chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3583, the PREPARE Act, of which I am pleased to be an original sponsor. Introduced by the subcommittee's former Chairwoman, Representative McSally, the PREPARE Act seeks to enhance accountability at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Office of Emergency Communications, and Office of Health Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security. The Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee is fortunate to work with a very engaged stakeholder community, and many of the provisions of this bill were formed through hearings, briefings, and meetings with those stakeholders. For example, the bill sets the period of performance for a number of grant programs at 3 years. We heard from numerous stakeholder groups that FEMA's reduction of the period of performance from 3 years to 2 years inhibited their ability to make meaningful grant investments. I am pleased that FEMA has changed the period of performance back to 3 years, and the PREPARE Act codifies that timeline. The PREPARE Act prohibits FEMA from implementing its National Preparedness Grant Program proposal, which was widely opposed by first responders. It seeks to ensure greater outreach by the Department to law enforcement agencies through the Office of State and local law enforcement. It prohibits the Undersecretary of National Protection and Programs Directorate from reorganizing or changing the location of the Office of Emergency Communications without authorization of Congress. Stakeholder groups such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Association of Fire Chiefs, Major Cities Chiefs, and National Sheriffs' Association have expressed their great concern about the impact this proposed reorganization would have on the Office of Emergency Communications and its work with first responders to achieve and maintain interoperability communications. It authorizes the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, which provides vital training for first responders, and it authorizes a voluntary anthrax vaccination program for first responders to help protect those who protect us. The PREPARE Act also includes flood insurance provisions of great importance to my constituents. Superstorm Sandy devastated Staten Island and South Brooklyn 3\1/2\ years ago, claiming dozens of lives and destroying thousands of homes. Unfortunately, since then, my constituents have gone through the storm after the storm. Damage inspectors shamelessly doctored their reports to blame pre-existing conditions for Sandy's destruction, cheating Sandy victims out of insurance proceedings they rightfully deserved. By applying lessons learned in the aftermath of that fateful day, title V of the PREPARE Act will make two important improvements to the National Flood Insurance Program. First, this legislation will empower and protect policyholders by requiring engineers and inspectors employed to assess flood insurance claims to provide policyholders with copies of the reports listing flood damage to their homes. This will prevent fraud and increase efficiency and transparency by giving policyholders more information about their claims at a critical stage in the process. Second, this legislation will improve the flood insurance claims appeal process by fixing an archaic and confusing court filing deadline that prevents policyholders from using the FEMA appeals process for fear of missing their opportunity to seek relief in Federal court. The bill will set a firm start date for the claim's statute of limitations and pause the statute of limitations while policyholders pursue their appeal at the agency level. Ultimately, this legislation will reduce costly litigation, saving taxpayers and policyholders money. I am pleased to work with Chairwoman McSally and Ranking Member Payne on this bipartisan legislation. I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their leadership in moving it forward. I would particularly like to thank Chairman Hensarling and Subcommittee Chairman Luetkemeyer of the Financial Services Committee for working with me to advance the flood insurance process reforms in this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 3583. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3583 seeks to resolve gaps in the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to build State and local capabilities to prevent, protect against, and respond to manmade and natural disasters. Again, this bipartisan legislation is a product of careful oversight and significant stakeholder outreach. I urge my colleagues to support the PREPARE Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3583. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act (PREPARE Act/H.R. 3583). In addition to enhancing accountability at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Office of Emergency Communications, and the Office of Health Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), this legislation makes critical reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP) claims process. Nearly three and a half years have passed since Superstorm Sandy devastated New Jersey, New York, and other parts of the Northeast, yet thousands of victims are still fighting for fair and equitable treatment from the NFIP. Following Sandy, these homeowners were further victimized by the unconscionable misconduct of certain insurance companies and engineering firms who defrauded them, all of which was enabled by FEMA's inadequate control and oversight. The Sandy Claims Review Process was launched after my colleagues and I pushed FEMA to reopen a robust and thorough claims process to review all potential Sandy-related underpayments. To date, over 19,000 NFIP policyholders have entered the review process. More than 7,000 policyholders have been offered additional claims payments, with over $46 million in actual payments made and over $89 million in proposed payments. Homeowners who pursued litigation outside of the claims process have received nearly $160 million in settlements. Those who dutifully paid their premiums with the expectation that the NFIP would be there following a disaster deserve every penny owed to them. The tens of millions of dollars paid out thus far should have been in the hands of policyholders years ago. These homeowners were betrayed following Sandy, and reforms are necessary to restore consumer trust and taxpayer confidence in the NFIP. In a report released last month, the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that FEMA does not provide adequate oversight of its NFIP Write Your Own (WYO) Program. As a result, FEMA ``is unable to ensure that WYO companies are properly implementing the NFIP and is unable to identify systemic problems in the program. Furthermore, without adequate internal controls in place, FEMA's NFIP funds may be at risk for fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement.'' Of particular concern are altered or falsified engineering reports that resulted in dramatically lower claim payments for Sandy victims. Last year, 60 Minutes' ``The Storm after the Storm'' reported on allegations of engineering reports receiving drastic alterations after being submitted to the insurer by the on-site engineer inspector. FEMA's then-Deputy Associate Administrator for Insurance told 60 Minutes that he was not going to ``conceal that fact that it happened. Because in the last three weeks, I've seen evidence of it.'' This was subsequently confirmed in delegation briefings I hosted with FEMA. [[Page H1977]] Title V of the PREPARE Act will require any final engineering reports and/or claims adjustment reports--certified and free of alterations--to be provided to the policyholder first, before any employer or agency. It also amends the claims appeal process to provide policyholders with more time to consider legal remedies. Together these provisions will help reform a fundamentally broken system and provide policyholders with the transparency and fairness they are entitled to throughout the NFIP claims process. FEMA must deliver on its promises. That begins with the completion of the ongoing Sandy Claims Review Process and a resolution to Sandy- related litigation. Every suspected instance of fraud must be investigated and bad actors must be expelled. FEMA must closely monitor the performance of specific inspectors and adjustors that may not be illegal, but simply shoddy and incompetent. The NFIP Transformation Task Force must continue its implementation of OIG's seven recommendations to improve its oversight. Together with the PREPARE Act, these actions can restore accountability and ensure lasting reform. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3583, the ``Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act,'' also known as the ``PREPARE Act.'' I became Ranking Member of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee in the beginning of 2013. I took on that position because I represent the 10th Congressional of New Jersey, which according to the New York Times, encompasses the two most dangerous miles in America. From major mass transit arteries and chemical facilities to homes and schools, my district is vulnerable to a variety of man-made and natural disasters. Our community's first responders must be prepared to respond to every worst-case scenario. That is why I was proud to work with Ms. McSally to author the ``PREPARE Act.'' In my capacity as Ranking Member of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity to hear from first responders and emergency managers across the country, as well as doctors, public health experts, and individuals advocating to ensure the needs of children are incorporated into disaster response plans. I am pleased to say that H.R. 3583 is responsive to the calls to action we have heard on the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee. For example, the Subcommittee has conducted extensive oversight of progress related to interoperable communications, and we have learned that the important governance structures--developed with support of the Interoperable Emergency Communications Grant Program--have suffered since the program was eliminated in 2011. To preserve the progress States have made on emergency communications planning and coordination, H.R. 3583 includes my Statewide Interoperable Communications Enhancement Act, which passed the House as a stand-alone measure in July. H.R. 3583 also includes language I offered to address communications training gaps at DHS by requiring all radio users to receive initial and ongoing training consistent with the DHS Interoperable Communications Strategy, which was required under legislation I wrote last year. The ``PREPARE Act'' also makes important progress in the area of biopreparedness, particularly related to improving how DHS manages its medical countermeasures program and establishing a voluntary anthrax vaccination program for first responders. To address concerns the Subcommittee heard from organizations like Save the Children related to the unique needs of children during disasters, the Committee accepted an amendment I offered directing FEMA to appoint a technical expert to ensure that children are incorporated into disaster preparedness, planning, response, and recovery activities. As the father of triplets, I have worked hard to improve the way the Federal government helps schools keep children safe during disasters and to address gaps in disaster planning that affect children. I appreciate the Committee's support for my efforts to ensure H.R. 3583 improves the way the needs of children are integrated into emergency planning. Finally, the bill guarantees homeland security grant program recipients three years to use their grant funds, which will help ensure that limited funds are spent effectively and deliberately. H.R. 3583 also includes common-sense provisions requiring grantees to have maintenance plans in place before using Federal money to procure important emergency response equipment, directing FEMA to include grant management best practices in its annual Notice of Funding Opportunity, and charging FEMA to provide information to Congress on how grant funds are closing capability gaps. On the subject of the Homeland Security Grant Program, I would like to once again, on the record, voice my opposition to the funding cuts proposed in the President's FY 2017 budget request. First responders across the country have made clear over and over again that these important grant dollars are critical to building and maintaining preparedness and response capabilities. State and local governments are already struggling to absorb cuts to homeland security grant funding that have occurred over the last decade, and every first responder I have spoken to tells me that planning, training, and exercise opportunities would further suffer with more cuts. I urge appropriators to reject the proposed funding cuts and to provide additional funding to these grant programs. Before I conclude, I would like to congratulate the former Subcommittee Chairman McSally on bringing this legislation to the floor, and I thank her for working with me as she developed the bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3583. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee and Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I rise in support of H.R. 3583, the PREPARE Act, a bill that provides an important additional tool in preparing for attacks and responding to emergencies. I support this legislation, because it requires multiple emergency agencies to coordinate and improve overall preparedness for attacks and emergencies. Specifically, H.R. 3583 amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Federal Emergency management Agency (FEMA) to enter into memoranda of understanding with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Office of Emergency Communication (OEC), the Office for State and Local Law Enforcement, the Countering Violent Extremism Coordinator, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and other Department of Homeland Security offices and components to delineate their responsibilities for awarding grants to: Public Transportation Agencies to improve security under Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. High-risk urban areas and state, local, and tribal governments to protect against terrorism under the UASI and the State Homeland Security Grant Program. Implementation of Area Maritime Transportation Security Plans and facility security plans, provide port security services, and train law enforcement personnel. The PREPARE Act is a smart bill that will enable the Department of Homeland Security to establish a social media working group to identify and provide guidance and best practices for the emergency preparedness and response community. The social media group will submit an annual report that includes: A review and analysis of social media technologies used to support preparedness, response, and recovery activities. A review of best practices and lessons learned. Recommendations to improve DHS's use of social media technologies for emergency management purposes. Recommendations to improve public awareness of the type of information disseminated through such technologies, and recommendations on how to access such information during emergencies. A review of available training for government officials. A review of coordination efforts with the private sector to discuss and resolve legal, operational, technical, privacy, and security concerns. In today's increasingly advanced and complex technology, social media is easily and heavily utilized by terrorists as a dangerous recruiting tool. Mr. Speaker, the PREPARE Act will equip the Department of Homeland Security with vital tools and resources to prevent and remove social media threats and recruitment tactics implemented by terrorist groups. The PREPARE Act will further require FEMA to integrate the needs of children into its activities to protect against natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters, including by appointing a technical expert to coordinate such activities. This is a comprehensive bill that will protect all Americans in every corner of this nation. I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 3583. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3583, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the [[Page H1978]] rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,82227,82227,82295,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [house] [pages h1969-h1978] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] promoting resilience and efficiency in preparing for attacks and responding to emergencies act ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 3583) to reform and improve the federal emergency management agency, the office of emergency communications, and the office of health affairs of the department of homeland security, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 3583 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title; table of contents.

gentlewoman from arizona (ms. mcsally) and the gentleman from mississippi (mr. thompson) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from arizona. general leave ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from arizona? there was no objection. ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 3583, the promoting resilience and efficiency in preparing for attacks and responding to emergencies, or prepare act, which i introduced during my tenure as chairman of the committee on homeland security's subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response, and communications. the prepare act is part of the committee on homeland security's effort to authorize and ensure the efficiency of the department of homeland security's operations. the provisions of this bill were informed by the subcommittee's oversight this congress and discussions with stakeholders. this was a bipartisan process, and i am pleased that the subcommittee's ranking member, congressman payne, joined me in sponsoring this bill. this bill is an example of how we should be working together in congress to get things done. the prepare act makes a number of improvements to the operations at the federal emergency management agency, office of health affairs, and office of emergency communications. the bill authorizes, for the first time, operation stonegarden, which provides grants to law enforcement agencies along the border to enhance border security. these funds are vital to the security of border communities, like the ones in my district in southern arizona. we must ensure that grant programs like the state homeland security grant program and the urban areas security initiative are providing a return on investment and assisting in the closure of capability gaps. that is why the bill requires fema to analyze data included in yearly state preparedness reports and threat and hazard identification and risk assessments to gauge year-over-year improvements. the bill also requires fema to share information on grants management best practices with grant recipients so that they may benefit from innovative practices used by other grantees. in addition, the bill sets the period of performance for these grant programs at 3 years, to ensure grant recipients have sufficient time to make sound investments. to ensure fema is operating efficiently and effectively, the bill requires the administrator to designate an individual to serve as fema's chief management official and take steps to address the findings and recommendations of a number of gao reports. the bill also requires fema to update its strategic human capital plan so it has the workforce it needs to complete its important mission. it is vital that our nation's first responders have the tools that they need to communicate. that is why the bill seeks to ensure that the first responder network authority and the department of homeland security work together to secure the nationwide public safety broadband network that is under development against cyberattacks. after hearing much concern from first responders who rely on the technical assistance and programming of the office of emergency communication, the bill prohibits the secretary of homeland security from reorganizing oec without prior authorization. {time} 1715 a 2015 gao review of interoperability at the department noted that cbp and ice personnel reported the lack of interoperability along the border resulted in missed apprehensions and jeopardized agent safety. as a result, the bill requires the department of homeland security to ensure that dhs' radio users, such as border patrol agents, cbp officers, and ice agents receive ongoing training on the use of radio systems, including interagency radio use protocols. this provision builds upon legislation signed into the law by the president that requires dhs to develop a strategy to achieve and maintain interoperability among its components. to address the chemical and biological threats we face, the prepare act authorizes responsibilities of the department's chief medical officer and establishes a pilot program to provide anthrax vaccines to first responders on a voluntary basis. i want to thank my successor, chairman donovan, for his leadership in continuing to shepherd the prepare act to the floor today. i would also like to thank chairman shuster, chairman upton, and chairman hensarling for working with us to advance this bill. mr. speaker, the prepare act builds efficiencies and increases coordination for preparedness improvements while providing greater accountability for taxpayers. i urge all members to join me in supporting this legislation. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. committee on transportation and infrastructure, house of representatives, washington, dc, march 10, 2016. hon. michael

the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the house floor. the committee on financial services takes this action with our mutual understanding that, by foregoing consideration of h.r. 3583 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues that fall within our rule x jurisdiction. our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any house-senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and requests your support for any such request. finally, i would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to h.r. 3583 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the congressional record during floor consideration thereof. sincerely, jeb hensarling, chairman. ____ house of representatives, committee on homeland security, washington, dc. april 6, 2016. hon. jeb hensarling, chairman, committee on financial services, rayburn house office building, washington, dc. dear chairman hensarling: thank you for your letter regarding h.r. 3583, the ``promoting resilience and efficiency in preparing for attacks and responding to emergencies act.'' i appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the house of representatives, and accordingly, understand the committee on financial services will forgo action on the bill. the committee on homeland security concurs with the mutual understanding that by forgoing action on this bill, the committee on financial services does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. in addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, i would support your request to have the committee on financial services represented on the conference committee. i will insert copies of this exchange into the congressional record during consideration of this bill on the house floor. i thank you for your cooperation in this matter. sincerely, michael t. mccaul, chairman. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 3853, the promoting resilience and efficiency in preparing for attacks and responding to emergencies act, and i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of h.r. 3583, the promoting resilience and efficiency in preparing for attacks and responding to emergencies act, also known as the prepare act. before i begin, i would like to commend former emergency preparedness subcommittee chairperson mcsally and ranking member payne, jr., for their close collaboration in developing this legislation. h.r. 3583 is the product of extensive bipartisan oversight carried out by the subcommittee and will make communities better prepared to respond to manmade and natural disasters. in particular, this measure makes a number of improvements related to the federal emergency management agency's administration of the homeland security grant program, authorizes activities of the national domestic preparedness consortium and the rural domestic preparedness consortium, and addresses ongoing interoperability challenges both within the department of homeland security and the state and local level. a provision i authored at the full committee to improve the homeland security grant program is also included. that provision directs fema to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the dhs' office of civil rights and civil liberties regarding policy and guidance in the urban areas security initiative and the state homeland security grant program. under current grant guidance, grantees are permitted to use funding for activities related to countering violent extremism. by requiring fema to consult with dhs' office of civil rights and civil liberties in developing its grant guidance related to cve, we will ensure that the activities carried out by the grantees do not target ordinary citizens simply because of their religion or ethnic background. additionally, to address shortcomings of the national incident management system, commonly called nims, revealed at a series of full committee hearings examining the heroic response of the 2013 boston marathon bombings, the committee accepted an amendment i authored requiring fema to review and revise nims once every 5 years. regular review of nims will ensure that its protocols are responsive to the current threat environment, incident management requirements, and lessons learned from previous incidents. finally, the bill includes important provisions to improve federal interoperable communications capabilities added by subcommittee ranking member payne, jr. to improve interoperable communications on the state and local level, h.r. 3583 includes mr. payne's statewide interoperable communications act, which facilitates coordination of emergency communication purchases and policies within a state. the bill also addresses interoperability challenges at dhs by requiring that the undersecretary for management verify that all radio users at the department receive initial and ongoing training in the use of dhs' radio systems. i commend ranking member payne, jr., on his work on the bill and his ongoing efforts to address the interoperability challenges that continue to hamstring federal, state, and local first responders. h.r. 3583 will go far in helping first responders do their job better and safer [[page h1976]] and will make our communities better prepared and more resilient. i urge my colleagues to support the prepare act. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from new york (mr. donovan), the chairman of the subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response, and communications. mr. donovan. mr. speaker, i thank chairwoman mcsally for yielding. as chairman of the committee on homeland security's subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response, and communications, i rise today in strong support of h.r. 3583, the prepare act, of which i am pleased to be an original sponsor. introduced by the subcommittee's former chairwoman, representative mcsally, the prepare act seeks to enhance accountability at the federal emergency management agency, office of emergency communications, and office of health affairs at the department of homeland security. the emergency preparedness, response, and communications subcommittee is fortunate to work with a very engaged stakeholder community, and many of the provisions of this bill were formed through hearings, briefings, and meetings with those stakeholders. for example, the bill sets the period of performance for a number of grant programs at 3 years. we heard from numerous stakeholder groups that fema's reduction of the period of performance from 3 years to 2 years inhibited their ability to make meaningful grant investments. i am pleased that fema has changed the period of performance back to 3 years, and the prepare act codifies that timeline. the prepare act prohibits fema from implementing its national preparedness grant program proposal, which was widely opposed by first responders. it seeks to ensure greater outreach by the department to law enforcement agencies through the office of state and local law enforcement. it prohibits the undersecretary of national protection and programs directorate from reorganizing or changing the location of the office of emergency communications without authorization of congress. stakeholder groups such as the international association of chiefs of police, international association of fire chiefs, major cities chiefs, and national sheriffs' association have expressed their great concern about the impact this proposed reorganization would have on the office of emergency communications and its work with first responders to achieve and maintain interoperability communications. it authorizes the national domestic preparedness consortium, which provides vital training for first responders, and it authorizes a voluntary anthrax vaccination program for first responders to help protect those who protect us. the prepare act also includes flood insurance provisions of great importance to my constituents. superstorm sandy devastated staten island and south brooklyn 3\1/2\ years ago, claiming dozens of lives and destroying thousands of homes. unfortunately, since then, my constituents have gone through the storm after the storm. damage inspectors shamelessly doctored their reports to blame pre-existing conditions for sandy's destruction, cheating sandy victims out of insurance proceedings they rightfully deserved. by applying lessons learned in the aftermath of that fateful day, title v of the prepare act will make two important improvements to the national flood insurance program. first, this legislation will empower and protect policyholders by requiring engineers and inspectors employed to assess flood insurance claims to provide policyholders with copies of the reports listing flood damage to their homes. this will prevent fraud and increase efficiency and transparency by giving policyholders more information about their claims at a critical stage in the process. second, this legislation will improve the flood insurance claims appeal process by fixing an archaic and confusing court filing deadline that prevents policyholders from using the fema appeals process for fear of missing their opportunity to seek relief in federal court. the bill will set a firm start date for the claim's statute of limitations and pause the statute of limitations while policyholders pursue their appeal at the agency level. ultimately, this legislation will reduce costly litigation, saving taxpayers and policyholders money. i am pleased to work with chairwoman mcsally and ranking member payne on this bipartisan legislation. i would like to thank chairman mccaul and ranking member thompson for their leadership in moving it forward. i would particularly like to thank chairman hensarling and subcommittee chairman luetkemeyer of the financial services committee for working with me to advance the flood insurance process reforms in this bill. mr. speaker, i urge all members to join me in supporting h.r. 3583. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, h.r. 3583 seeks to resolve gaps in the department of homeland security's efforts to build state and local capabilities to prevent, protect against, and respond to manmade and natural disasters. again, this bipartisan legislation is a product of careful oversight and significant stakeholder outreach. i urge my colleagues to support the prepare act. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i once again urge my colleagues to support h.r. 3583. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of the promoting resilience and efficiency in preparing for attacks and responding to emergencies act (prepare act/h.r. 3583). in addition to enhancing accountability at the federal emergency management agency (fema), the office of emergency communications, and the office of health affairs at the department of homeland security (dhs), this legislation makes critical reforms to the national flood insurance program's (nfip) claims process. nearly three and a half years have passed since superstorm sandy devastated new jersey, new york, and other parts of the northeast, yet thousands of victims are still fighting for fair and equitable treatment from the nfip. following sandy, these homeowners were further victimized by the unconscionable misconduct of certain insurance companies and engineering firms who defrauded them, all of which was enabled by fema's inadequate control and oversight. the sandy claims review process was launched after my colleagues and i pushed fema to reopen a robust and thorough claims process to review all potential sandy-related underpayments. to date, over 19,000 nfip policyholders have entered the review process. more than 7,000 policyholders have been offered additional claims payments, with over $46 million in actual payments made and over $89 million in proposed payments. homeowners who pursued litigation outside of the claims process have received nearly $160 million in settlements. those who dutifully paid their premiums with the expectation that the nfip would be there following a disaster deserve every penny owed to them. the tens of millions of dollars paid out thus far should have been in the hands of policyholders years ago. these homeowners were betrayed following sandy, and reforms are necessary to restore consumer trust and taxpayer confidence in the nfip. in a report released last month, the dhs office of inspector general (oig) found that fema does not provide adequate oversight of its nfip write your own (wyo) program. as a result, fema ``is unable to ensure that wyo companies are properly implementing the nfip and is unable to identify systemic problems in the program. furthermore, without adequate internal controls in place, fema's nfip funds may be at risk for fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement.'' of particular concern are altered or falsified engineering reports that resulted in dramatically lower claim payments for sandy victims. last year, 60 minutes' ``the storm after the storm'' reported on allegations of engineering reports receiving drastic alterations after being submitted to the insurer by the on-site engineer inspector. fema's then-deputy associate administrator for insurance told 60 minutes that he was not going to ``conceal that fact that it happened. because in the last three weeks, i've seen evidence of it.'' this was subsequently confirmed in delegation briefings i hosted with fema. [[page h1977]] title v of the prepare act will require any final engineering reports and/or claims adjustment reports--certified and free of alterations--to be provided to the policyholder first, before any employer or agency. it also amends the claims appeal process to provide policyholders with more time to consider legal remedies. together these provisions will help reform a fundamentally broken system and provide policyholders with the transparency and fairness they are entitled to throughout the nfip claims process. fema must deliver on its promises. that begins with the completion of the ongoing sandy claims review process and a resolution to sandy- related litigation. every suspected instance of fraud must be investigated and bad actors must be expelled. fema must closely monitor the performance of specific inspectors and adjustors that may not be illegal, but simply shoddy and incompetent. the nfip transformation task force must continue its implementation of oig's seven recommendations to improve its oversight. together with the prepare act, these actions can restore accountability and ensure lasting reform. mr. payne. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of h.r. 3583, the ``promoting resilience and efficiency in preparing for attacks and responding to emergencies act,'' also known as the ``prepare act.'' i became ranking member of the emergency preparedness subcommittee in the beginning of 2013. i took on that position because i represent the 10th congressional of new jersey, which according to the new york times, encompasses the two most dangerous miles in america. from major mass transit arteries and chemical facilities to homes and schools, my district is vulnerable to a variety of man-made and natural disasters. our community's first responders must be prepared to respond to every worst-case scenario. that is why i was proud to work with ms. mcsally to author the ``prepare act.'' in my capacity as ranking member of the emergency preparedness subcommittee, i have had the opportunity to hear from first responders and emergency managers across the country, as well as doctors, public health experts, and individuals advocating to ensure the needs of children are incorporated into disaster response plans. i am pleased to say that h.r. 3583 is responsive to the calls to action we have heard on the emergency preparedness subcommittee. for example, the subcommittee has conducted extensive oversight of progress related to interoperable communications, and we have learned that the important governance structures--developed with support of the interoperable emergency communications grant program--have suffered since the program was eliminated in 2011. to preserve the progress states have made on emergency communications planning and coordination, h.r. 3583 includes my statewide interoperable communications enhancement act, which passed the house as a stand-alone measure in july. h.r. 3583 also includes language i offered to address communications training gaps at dhs by requiring all radio users to receive initial and ongoing training consistent with the dhs interoperable communications strategy, which was required under legislation i wrote last year. the ``prepare act'' also makes important progress in the area of biopreparedness, particularly related to improving how dhs manages its medical countermeasures program and establishing a voluntary anthrax vaccination program for first responders. to address concerns the subcommittee heard from organizations like save the children related to the unique needs of children during disasters, the committee accepted an amendment i offered directing fema to appoint a technical expert to ensure that children are incorporated into disaster preparedness, planning, response, and recovery activities. as the father of triplets, i have worked hard to improve the way the federal government helps schools keep children safe during disasters and to address gaps in disaster planning that affect children. i appreciate the committee's support for my efforts to ensure h.r. 3583 improves the way the needs of children are integrated into emergency planning. finally, the bill guarantees homeland security grant program recipients three years to use their grant funds, which will help ensure that limited funds are spent effectively and deliberately. h.r. 3583 also includes common-sense provisions requiring grantees to have maintenance plans in place before using federal money to procure important emergency response equipment, directing fema to include grant management best practices in its annual notice of funding opportunity, and charging fema to provide information to congress on how grant funds are closing capability gaps. on the subject of the homeland security grant program, i would like to once again, on the record, voice my opposition to the funding cuts proposed in the president's fy 2017 budget request. first responders across the country have made clear over and over again that these important grant dollars are critical to building and maintaining preparedness and response capabilities. state and local governments are already struggling to absorb cuts to homeland security grant funding that have occurred over the last decade, and every first responder i have spoken to tells me that planning, training, and exercise opportunities would further suffer with more cuts. i urge appropriators to reject the proposed funding cuts and to provide additional funding to these grant programs. before i conclude, i would like to congratulate the former subcommittee chairman mcsally on bringing this legislation to the floor, and i thank her for working with me as she developed the bill. i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 3583. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, as the ranking member of the judiciary committee and subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations, i rise in support of h.r. 3583, the prepare act, a bill that provides an important additional tool in preparing for attacks and responding to emergencies. i support this legislation, because it requires multiple emergency agencies to coordinate and improve overall preparedness for attacks and emergencies. specifically, h.r. 3583 amends the homeland security act of 2002 to require the federal emergency management agency (fema) to enter into memoranda of understanding with u.s. customs and border protection (cbp), the transportation security administration, the coast guard, the office of intelligence and analysis, the office of emergency communication (oec), the office for state and local law enforcement, the countering violent extremism coordinator, the office for civil rights and civil liberties, and other department of homeland security offices and components to delineate their responsibilities for awarding grants to: public transportation agencies to improve security under recommendations of the 9/11 commission act of 2007. high-risk urban areas and state, local, and tribal governments to protect against terrorism under the uasi and the state homeland security grant program. implementation of area maritime transportation security plans and facility security plans, provide port security services, and train law enforcement personnel. the prepare act is a smart bill that will enable the department of homeland security to establish a social media working group to identify and provide guidance and best practices for the emergency preparedness and response community. the social media group will submit an annual report that includes: a review and analysis of social media technologies used to support preparedness, response, and recovery activities. a review of best practices and lessons learned. recommendations to improve dhs's use of social media technologies for emergency management purposes. recommendations to improve public awareness of the type of information disseminated through such technologies, and recommendations on how to access such information during emergencies. a review of available training for government officials. a review of coordination efforts with the private sector to discuss and resolve legal, operational, technical, privacy, and security concerns. in today's increasingly advanced and complex technology, social media is easily and heavily utilized by terrorists as a dangerous recruiting tool. mr. speaker, the prepare act will equip the department of homeland security with vital tools and resources to prevent and remove social media threats and recruitment tactics implemented by terrorist groups. the prepare act will further require fema to integrate the needs of children into its activities to protect against natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters, including by appointing a technical expert to coordinate such activities. this is a comprehensive bill that will protect all americans in every corner of this nation. i urge all members to join me in voting to pass h.r. 3583. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from arizona (ms. mcsally) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3583, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the [[page h1978]] rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",82227

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT AND ADOPTION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BISON AS THE NATIONAL MAMMAL. (a) In General.--The mammal commonly known as the ``North American bison'' is adopted as the national mammal of the United States. (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act or the adoption of the North American bison as the national mammal of the United States shall be construed or used as a reason to alter, change, modify, or otherwise affect any plan, policy, management decision, regulation, or other action by the Federal Government. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I would prefer to have the primary sponsor of this bill, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay), speak first. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. Chaffetz. Today I rise in support of the National Bison Legacy Act. This bill will adopt the North American bison as the national mammal of the United States. I also want to thank my colleague from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem) for her cosponsorship of this legislation. {time} 1730 The bison are dear to me because they have a historical and spiritual link to the United States Colored Troops who were first organized in 1863 to 1866 as the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the four all-Black infantry regiments. Despite facing relentless racism and woefully inadequate military supplies, nicknamed the Buffalo Soldiers because of their tireless marching and dogged trail skills, they had earned the name of the rugged and revered buffalo. By way of reference, my great-great- grandfather and his brother were members of the Buffalo Soldiers after coming out of slavery. The North American bison is a unifying symbol in the United States. Once numbering in the tens of millions, bison were nearly extinguished by the 1880s, with the travesty borne most by Native Americans whose fate was intertwined with the buffalo. In 1905, visionary ranchers, tribes, industrialists, sport hunters, and conservationists joined President Theodore Roosevelt in a monumental effort to reverse the American bison's demise. Now over 60 tribes are working to restore bison to over 1 million acres of Native American lands. Bison production on private ranches is in its strongest economic condition in more than a decade. The National Bison Legacy Act enjoys broad bipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress, as well as support from a coalition of over 60 organizations, including Native American tribes, ranchers, and government agencies. The list keeps growing. I look forward to working with all of you to make this bill become law and honor a great American icon, the bison. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time and ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) control the remainder of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Missouri? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem). Mrs. NOEM. I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, today I support the National Bison Legacy Act because it is a very important bill to the tribes in my State and also to the heritage of South Dakota and the United States. It is a bill that I helped Representative Clay of Missouri introduce, and I thank him for all of his hard work on the legislation. It has been a long process, but we are finally here today to get it across the House floor. I am thrilled to sponsor this bill with my colleagues, to raise up an enduring symbol of our Nation's Native American heritage, the American frontier, and the resilience that has long distinguished America from others around the globe. The Tatanka is important both physically and spiritually in Native American culture. These animals offered food, shelter, tools, and clothing. Native Americans could make soap from the fat and homes from their hides. Every piece was used, which is why bison were, and continue to be, a symbol of survival and a cultural example of how to live in a healthy and productive manner. This bill recognizes that. There are also lessons to be learned about resilience from these animals. [[Page H1979]] Bison roamed across most of North America before nearly being wiped from existence. Through the efforts of tribes, ranchers, conservationists, and others, the species has survived and can once again be lifted as a literal and cultural example of productivity from which each of us can learn. I am proud that my family has raised bison as well. They are majestic animals that represent the Plains that we are so proud of and that I am so honored to represent today. I want to thank the chairman and his staff for bringing this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In conclusion, let me just say one of the most majestic animals on the face of the planet is the American bison. You go to see it and you just sit in awe and you think of the rich history and the role that it has played in our Nation. It serves as a symbol on two of our State flags, and it is the seal of the Department of the Interior. I just want to say that I hope all Americans--especially the youth-- get a chance to see one of the bison out in the wild. It was close to extinction, but it was brought back. There are hundreds of thousands of them now. Whether you go to South Dakota or up to Yellowstone, Montana, there are places where you can really see these bison out. It really is an amazing sight. I think it is appropriate that we move this bill today. I want to thank Mr. Clay of Missouri and, in particular, Mrs. Noem of South Dakota for her recognizing the importance of this issue. I also want to thank Mrs. Lummis of Wyoming. She offered an important amendment that made an adjustment to the bill. I think this is a smart thing for the Congress to do, and I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2908, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1978-H1979] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL BISON LEGACY ACT Mr. CHAFFETZ.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I would prefer to have the primary sponsor of this bill, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay), speak first. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. Chaffetz. Today I rise in support of the National Bison Legacy Act. This bill will adopt the North American bison as the national mammal of the United States. I also want to thank my colleague from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem) for her cosponsorship of this legislation. {time} 1730 The bison are dear to me because they have a historical and spiritual link to the United States Colored Troops who were first organized in 1863 to 1866 as the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the four all-Black infantry regiments. Despite facing relentless racism and woefully inadequate military supplies, nicknamed the Buffalo Soldiers because of their tireless marching and dogged trail skills, they had earned the name of the rugged and revered buffalo. By way of reference, my great-great- grandfather and his brother were members of the Buffalo Soldiers after coming out of slavery. The North American bison is a unifying symbol in the United States. Once numbering in the tens of millions, bison were nearly extinguished by the 1880s, with the travesty borne most by Native Americans whose fate was intertwined with the buffalo. In 1905, visionary ranchers, tribes, industrialists, sport hunters, and conservationists joined President Theodore Roosevelt in a monumental effort to reverse the American bison's demise. Now over 60 tribes are working to restore bison to over 1 million acres of Native American lands. Bison production on private ranches is in its strongest economic condition in more than a decade. The National Bison Legacy Act enjoys broad bipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress, as well as support from a coalition of over 60 organizations, including Native American tribes, ranchers, and government agencies. The list keeps growing. I look forward to working with all of you to make this bill become law and honor a great American icon, the bison. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time and ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) control the remainder of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Missouri? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem). Mrs. NOEM. I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, today I support the National Bison Legacy Act because it is a very important bill to the tribes in my State and also to the heritage of South Dakota and the United States. It is a bill that I helped Representative Clay of Missouri introduce, and I thank him for all of his hard work on the legislation. It has been a long process, but we are finally here today to get it across the House floor. I am thrilled to sponsor this bill with my colleagues, to raise up an enduring symbol of our Nation's Native American heritage, the American frontier, and the resilience that has long distinguished America from others around the globe. The Tatanka is important both physically and spiritually in Native American culture. These animals offered food, shelter, tools, and clothing. Native Americans could make soap from the fat and homes from their hides. Every piece was used, which is why bison were, and continue to be, a symbol of survival and a cultural example of how to live in a healthy and productive manner. This bill recognizes that. There are also lessons to be learned about resilience from these animals. [[Page H1979]] Bison roamed across most of North America before nearly being wiped from existence. Through the efforts of tribes, ranchers, conservationists, and others, the species has survived and can once again be lifted as a literal and cultural example of productivity from which each of us can learn. I am proud that my family has raised bison as well. They are majestic animals that represent the Plains that we are so proud of and that I am so honored to represent today. I want to thank the chairman and his staff for bringing this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In conclusion, let me just say one of the most majestic animals on the face of the planet is the American bison. You go to see it and you just sit in awe and you think of the rich history and the role that it has played in our Nation. It serves as a symbol on two of our State flags, and it is the seal of the Department of the Interior. I just want to say that I hope all Americans--especially the youth-- get a chance to see one of the bison out in the wild. It was close to extinction, but it was brought back. There are hundreds of thousands of them now. Whether you go to South Dakota or up to Yellowstone, Montana, there are places where you can really see these bison out. It really is an amazing sight. I think it is appropriate that we move this bill today. I want to thank Mr. Clay of Missouri and, in particular, Mrs. Noem of South Dakota for her recognizing the importance of this issue. I also want to thank Mrs. Lummis of Wyoming. She offered an important amendment that made an adjustment to the bill. I think this is a smart thing for the Congress to do, and I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2908, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1978-H1979] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL BISON LEGACY ACT Mr. CHAFFETZ.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to [[Page H1982]] revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 4359 is a commonsense solution to address the misuse of administrative leave for misconduct or performance issues. Unfortunately, it has been commonplace for the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to hear stories of Federal employees who remain on administrative leave for months, or years, at a time. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. The overwhelming majority of people who work for the Federal Government are good, honest, decent, patriotic people who care. They work hard, they are trying to serve their country, and they put in an honest day's work. But we do have some bad apples. Every once in a while, they show up, and they start working for the Federal Government. They create problems and they create mayhem. Unfortunately, we have to tighten the rules surrounding their situation because we have had a number of Federal employees that have remained on administrative leave sometimes not just for days, sometimes not just for weeks. Sometimes this drags on for months and for years-- years--to be on administrative leave. While on administrative leave, these employees receive full pay and benefits despite the fact that they are not working. There are going to be extraordinary circumstances, but this is happening far too often. It is particularly difficult to understand how the IRS could, for example, justify allowing Lois Lerner to sit on administrative leave for 4 months before her retirement. She was an individual who abused her power as a Federal employee by engaging in the political targeting of American citizens. But she is not alone. This is certainly not a bill just about her situation. Every year, hundreds, if not thousands, of Federal employees are under investigation for significant misconduct and remain on administrative leave for far longer than is necessary to complete an investigation. One reason administrative leave has become such a significant problem is because agencies simply find it easier to keep an employee on administrative leave. It is the path of least resistance. This means that some individuals face little to no penalty for significant misconduct and are all too often permitted to remain on administrative leave until they are able to retire. Mr. Speaker, abuse of administrative leave is a real problem. H.R. 4359 will protect American taxpayer dollars from being further wasted. Consider one example highlighted by the inspector general for the Environmental Protection Agency, who found an employee earning $120,000 a year annually while watching pornography on the job. This employee was placed on administrative leave for a year--a year. I believe, in this particular case, this person actually admitted to doing it. It wasn't just a casual oops. This person was watching for literally hours upon hours each day and admitted it. They put him on administrative leave, and this went on for a year. Why should the American taxpayers have to pay for that? It is a clear waste of our dollars. The American people deserve better, and so do the employees who work around this person. According to the Government Accountability Office report, the GAO, which reviewed the use of administrative leave between the years 2011 and 2013, 263 Federal employees were on administrative leave for more than a year at the 24 agencies reviewed. GAO found that those individuals on administrative leave cost the people, the American taxpayers, more than $31 million. Why should we have to pay for that? It is an astonishing amount of money to pay for Federal employees, and they are doing absolutely nothing. They can, essentially, go wherever they want to go, and it is, essentially, a paid vacation. It also sends the wrong message to the hardworking Americans from whom we levee taxes. We cannot use tax dollars to pay misbehaving or poor-performing Federal employees. There are often situations that come up where the employees need a fair chance to defend themselves. But again, under this bill, it gives them plenty of time to do that. If there needs to be an extension, there can be an extension; but if there is not timely disciplinary action, if any disciplinary action at all, for their performance issues, the American taxpayers are left holding the bag and the expense. Mr. Speaker, agencies are abusing the system of administrative leave and failing to explain why. In a report conducted by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, agencies were found to be opaque about why they were using administrative leave, or completely nonresponsive, when Senator Grassley inquired about 58 employees at the Department of Defense that they had on administrative leave for more than a year. Think about that. At the DOD, the Department of Defense, they had 58 employees who had been on administrative leave for more than a year, and the Department of Defense just decided not to respond, just literally did not respond. Mr. Speaker, I understand the need and utility of administrative leave. When used properly, administrative leave provides agencies with the flexibility needed to better manage human resources and to get to the bottom of certain situations, but it has become a tool that agencies hide behind with far too little oversight and accountability. The shortcomings of the current system need to end, and this bill that I am the chief sponsor of will curb these abuses. Specifically, this legislation will limit the use of administrative leave for misconduct or performance issues to 14 days per year in order to push agencies to complete their investigations quickly or to find acceptable alternate work for the individual to perform during such an investigation. This is fair to the employee, as well as the management, as well as the American taxpayers. Rather than allowing indefinite leave, agencies will have to take disciplinary action against bad actors, which will serve to bring greater accountability to the Federal workforce. The bill is also critical to protecting whistleblowers. The Office of Special Counsel, or the OSC, has a responsibility in the Federal Government to investigate potential reprisal and petition the Merit Systems Protection Board to stop retaliatory actions. However, being put on administrative leave does not constitute a personnel action that is reviewable by the OSC. Thus, as long as a whistleblower is placed on administrative leave, he or she is left in limbo at the discretion of the agency with no right to appeal their status. Because of this, I believe that the bill before us, H.R. 4359, will go a long way to help reducing retaliation and protect whistleblowers by barring agencies from leaving employees on indefinite administrative leave. Mr. Speaker, getting this legislation to the floor today, I am proud to say we have been able to work collaboratively in a bipartisan way. I particularly want to thank Mr. Lynch of Massachusetts for his passion on this issue and working with us. We incorporated some of those suggestions into the bill today. We have altered the bill to give the agencies the option to extend the use of administrative leave beyond 14 days in discrete 30-day periods. Under these provisions, the agencies will be required to report to Congress after the use of the first 30-day extension, detailing why the extension is necessary, the stage of any investigation against the employee, the reasons the employee cannot return to the workplace, as well as other pertinent information. Again, I want to thank Mr. Lynch for his work on this legislation. I believe that this is a stronger bill and more fair to the employees. I think it was an important step forward. I thank Mr. Cummings, the committee as a whole, and the many members who were involved in getting the bill to this point today. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I think we can all agree that agency overuse of administrative leave can be a problem and that we need to pursue ways that agencies can use administrative leave more efficiently, while preserving due process protections for Federal employees. [[Page H1983]] I want to thank the chairman for working with the minority, and particularly with Representative Lynch, to address our concerns that the original bill could have encouraged agencies to suspend employees without pay and without due process. The bill, as reported, would preserve the ability of an agency to place employees on administrative leave in those exceptional circumstances when they may pose a threat to safety, agency mission, or government property. It would also allow the agency to consider the results of a thorough and complete investigation prior to taking disciplinary action. The bill, however, would not punish employees by stripping them of pay before allegations are properly adjudicated, preserving the principle that one is innocent until proven guilty. The bill before us strikes the appropriate balance, we believe, between the need for stricter oversight of agency use of administrative leave and the due process rights of Federal employees. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4359. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 4359. We have worked in a good, bipartisan way. It is a good bill for the country and is good for the employees of the Federal Government. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Womack). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4359, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1981-H1983] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE REFORM ACT Mr. CHAFFETZ.

She was an individual who abused her power as a Federal employee by engaging in the political targeting of American citizens. But she is not alone. This is certainly not a bill just about her situation. Every year, hundreds, if not thousands, of Federal employees are under investigation for significant misconduct and remain on administrative leave for far longer than is necessary to complete an investigation. One reason administrative leave has become such a significant problem is because agencies simply find it easier to keep an employee on administrative leave. It is the path of least resistance. This means that some individuals face little to no penalty for significant misconduct and are all too often permitted to remain on administrative leave until they are able to retire. Mr. Speaker, abuse of administrative leave is a real problem. H.R. 4359 will protect American taxpayer dollars from being further wasted. Consider one example highlighted by the inspector general for the Environmental Protection Agency, who found an employee earning $120,000 a year annually while watching pornography on the job. This employee was placed on administrative leave for a year--a year. I believe, in this particular case, this person actually admitted to doing it. It wasn't just a casual oops. This person was watching for literally hours upon hours each day and admitted it. They put him on administrative leave, and this went on for a year. Why should the American taxpayers have to pay for that? It is a clear waste of our dollars. The American people deserve better, and so do the employees who work around this person. According to the Government Accountability Office report, the GAO, which reviewed the use of administrative leave between the years 2011 and 2013, 263 Federal employees were on administrative leave for more than a year at the 24 agencies reviewed. GAO found that those individuals on administrative leave cost the people, the American taxpayers, more than $31 million. Why should we have to pay for that? It is an astonishing amount of money to pay for Federal employees, and they are doing absolutely nothing. They can, essentially, go wherever they want to go, and it is, essentially, a paid vacation. It also sends the wrong message to the hardworking Americans from whom we levee taxes. We cannot use tax dollars to pay misbehaving or poor-performing Federal employees. There are often situations that come up where the employees need a fair chance to defend themselves. But again, under this bill, it gives them plenty of time to do that. If there needs to be an extension, there can be an extension; but if there is not timely disciplinary action, if any disciplinary action at all, for their performance issues, the American taxpayers are left holding the bag and the expense. Mr. Speaker, agencies are abusing the system of administrative leave and failing to explain why. In a report conducted by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, agencies were found to be opaque about why they were using administrative leave, or completely nonresponsive, when Senator Grassley inquired about 58 employees at the Department of Defense that they had on administrative leave for more than a year. Think about that. At the DOD, the Department of Defense, they had 58 employees who had been on administrative leave for more than a year, and the Department of Defense just decided not to respond, just literally did not respond. Mr. Speaker, I understand the need and utility of administrative leave. When used properly, administrative leave provides agencies with the flexibility needed to better manage human resources and to get to the bottom of certain situations, but it has become a tool that agencies hide behind with far too little oversight and accountability. The shortcomings of the current system need to end, and this bill that I am the chief sponsor of will curb these abuses. Specifically, this legislation will limit the use of administrative leave for misconduct or performance issues to 14 days per year in order to push agencies to complete their investigations quickly or to find acceptable alternate work for the individual to perform during such an investigation. This is fair to the employee, as well as the management, as well as the American taxpayers. Rather than allowing indefinite leave, agencies will have to take disciplinary action against bad actors, which will serve to bring greater accountability to the Federal workforce. The bill is also critical to protecting whistleblowers. The Office of Special Counsel, or the OSC, has a responsibility in the Federal Government to investigate potential reprisal and petition the Merit Systems Protection Board to stop retaliatory actions. However, being put on administrative leave does not constitute a personnel action that is reviewable by the OSC. Thus, as long as a whistleblower is placed on administrative leave, he or she is left in limbo at the discretion of the agency with no right to appeal their status. Because of this, I believe that the bill before us, H.R. 4359, will go a long way to help reducing retaliation and protect whistleblowers by barring agencies from leaving employees on indefinite administrative leave. Mr. Speaker, getting this legislation to the floor today, I am proud to say we have been able to work collaboratively in a bipartisan way. I particularly want to thank Mr. Lynch of Massachusetts for his passion on this issue and working with us. We incorporated some of those suggestions into the bill today. We have altered the bill to give the agencies the option to extend the use of administrative leave beyond 14 days in discrete 30-day periods. Under these provisions, the agencies will be required to report to Congress after the use of the first 30-day extension, detailing why the extension is necessary, the stage of any investigation against the employee, the reasons the employee cannot return to the workplace, as well as other pertinent information. Again, I want to thank Mr. Lynch for his work on this legislation. I believe that this is a stronger bill and more fair to the employees. I think it was an important step forward. I thank Mr. Cummings, the committee as a whole, and the many members who were involved in getting the bill to this point today. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I think we can all agree that agency overuse of administrative leave can be a problem and that we need to pursue ways that agencies can use administrative leave more efficiently, while preserving due process protections for Federal employees. [[Page H1983]] I want to thank the chairman for working with the minority, and particularly with Representative Lynch, to address our concerns that the original bill could have encouraged agencies to suspend employees without pay and without due process. The bill, as reported, would preserve the ability of an agency to place employees on administrative leave in those exceptional circumstances when they may pose a threat to safety, agency mission, or government property. It would also allow the agency to consider the results of a thorough and complete investigation prior to taking disciplinary action. The bill, however, would not punish employees by stripping them of pay before allegations are properly adjudicated, preserving the principle that one is innocent until proven guilty. The bill before us strikes the appropriate balance, we believe, between the need for stricter oversight of agency use of administrative leave and the due process rights of Federal employees. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4359. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 4359. We have worked in a good, bipartisan way. It is a good bill for the country and is good for the employees of the Federal Government. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Womack). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4359, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,15666,15666,15734,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [house] [pages h1981-h1983] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] administrative leave reform act mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i move that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 4359) to amend title 5, united states code, to provide that federal employees may not be placed on administrative leave for more than 14 days during any year for misconduct or poor performance, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 4359 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``administrative leave reform act''. sec. 2. limitation on administrative leave.

there was no objection. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. h.r. 4359 is a commonsense solution to address the misuse of administrative leave for misconduct or performance issues. unfortunately, it has been commonplace for the oversight and government reform committee to hear stories of federal employees who remain on administrative leave for months, or years, at a time. let me be clear, mr. speaker. the overwhelming majority of people who work for the federal government are good, honest, decent, patriotic people who care. they work hard, they are trying to serve their country, and they put in an honest day's work. but we do have some bad apples. every once in a while, they show up, and they start working for the federal government. they create problems and they create mayhem. unfortunately, we have to tighten the rules surrounding their situation because we have had a number of federal employees that have remained on administrative leave sometimes not just for days, sometimes not just for weeks. sometimes this drags on for months and for years-- years--to be on administrative leave. while on administrative leave, these employees receive full pay and benefits despite the fact that they are not working. there are going to be extraordinary circumstances, but this is happening far too often. it is particularly difficult to understand how the irs could, for example, justify allowing lois lerner to sit on administrative leave for 4 months before her retirement. she was an individual who abused her power as a federal employee by engaging in the political targeting of american citizens. but she is not alone. this is certainly not a bill just about her situation. every year, hundreds, if not thousands, of federal employees are under investigation for significant misconduct and remain on administrative leave for far longer than is necessary to complete an investigation. one reason administrative leave has become such a significant problem is because agencies simply find it easier to keep an employee on administrative leave. it is the path of least resistance. this means that some individuals face little to no penalty for significant misconduct and are all too often permitted to remain on administrative leave until they are able to retire. mr. speaker, abuse of administrative leave is a real problem. h.r. 4359 will protect american taxpayer dollars from being further wasted. consider one example highlighted by the inspector general for the environmental protection agency, who found an employee earning $120,000 a year annually while watching pornography on the job. this employee was placed on administrative leave for a year--a year. i believe, in this particular case, this person actually admitted to doing it. it wasn't just a casual oops. this person was watching for literally hours upon hours each day and admitted it. they put him on administrative leave, and this went on for a year. why should the american taxpayers have to pay for that?

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I prefer to have the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, who is the chief sponsor of this bill, speak first on this issue. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume and thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on behalf of H.R. 2615, the Virgin Islands of the United States Centennial Commission Act. H.R. 2615 will establish a short-term commission to research, plan, develop, and carry out activities related to the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Islands becoming part of the United States. The commission will revisit the history leading up to and directly following the transfer of the islands from Denmark to the United States. Its purpose will be to educate those unaware of that history on a national level of the importance of the territories to the geopolitical advancement of this great Nation. The history of the Virgin Islands and its people is profound, Mr. Speaker. It tells a story of a land so resource-rich and unique in its geography that it was occupied by seven different nations. It tells the story of a resilient people who insurrected slavery and colonial oppression to achieve self-governance. In 1493, when Christopher Columbus landed on the island of St. Croix, which was then called Aye Aye by its native inhabitants, it is the only place in what is now the United States in which Christopher Columbus landed, but it is also reported to be the first place that he met armed resistance. He renamed islands, part of a chain, the Virgin Islands. In 1733, on the island of St. John, the slaves rose up, taking control of the island for almost a year until European powers worked together and the Danish received the help of the French and Spanish Armada to help quell what would have been and was one of the first slave uprisings in the New World. In the mid-1700s, a young boy on the island of St. Croix by the name of Alexander Hamilton received the support of merchant patrons on the island who put together sufficient money to finance his travel and education to the Colonies. He brought to the Colonies his understanding of finance and a monetary system learned from apprenticeship from those merchants, as well as the unique accounting theories from the West African slaves of the island. Those economic gifts, along with his fighting spirit for revolution, liberty, and abolitionist fervor served him and this country well, as he would soon become the first United States Secretary of the Treasury and creator of our modern financial system. Virgin Islanders have played an integral role in the history of this Nation well before we were even part of this country. From its inception and beyond, activists and politicians, David Levy Yulee, the first Jewish United States Senator; Denmark Vesey, leader of the Charleston, South Carolina, slave revolt; Judah Benjamin, Secretary of Treasury of the Confederate Army, are all Virgin Islanders. William Leidesdorff, the founder of San Francisco, and Edward Wilmot Blyden, one of the founders of Liberia, are also from the Virgin Islands. After purchase by the United States in 1917, the contributions of Virgin Islanders have continued through individuals like David Hamilton Jackson, who was a staunch free press advocate and labor movement leader; Hubert Harrison, a key figure in the movement of the Harlem Renaissance; military veterans like Alton Adams, who was the first African American naval bandleader; and General Samuel Ebbesen. Ambassador Terence Todman and Congress of Racial Equality chief, Roy Innis, are Virgin Islanders. Actor Kelsey Grammer and future NBA Hall- of-Famer Timothy Duncan are all from the Virgin Islands. The first female physician of this body as a Member of Congress, my predecessor, Donna Christensen, is a Virgin Islander. During the time of exploration and slave trade, our geographic location made us a hub of Western Hemisphere commerce for several centuries and served a crucial role in naval military activity in the Caribbean Basin. So nearly a century ago, the United States purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark for its geographic importance. On March 31, 2017, the Virgin Islands of the United States will celebrate 100 years as a possession and part of the union of the United States. This bill, H.R. 2615, establishes the Virgin Islands of the United States Centennial Commission to research, plan, develop, and carry out activities the commission considers appropriate to commemorate--and I say commemorate, not celebrate--commemorate a more solemn and worthy endeavor, the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Islands of the United States becoming an unincorporated territory of the United States. Now, I have spent a lot of time talking about the Virgin Islands' history and people because at the time of its transfer nearly 100 years ago, little thought was given to the history, and even less to the people of the Virgin Islands. As the Islanders during that time, my ancestors, my grandparents, watched the Danish flag come down and the Stars and Stripes unfold and ripple over the Fort in Christiansted and over many places in the Virgin Islands, they thought out loud: We knew what we had, but we don't know what we are going to get. Our elders and leaders hoped and believed that the purchase by the United States would herald greater opportunities and profound modernization. Unfortunately, this has not happened. It took a decade of petitioning and lobbying to be given citizenship, and we asked for--we asked for it and petitioned again to be part of the draft. What people willingly offer their sons to fight and die, except those wholly willing to be part of the entire American experience? Even now we have greater casualties per capita than any other group in this Nation in a volunteer military and is an example in part of our valor and patriotism. Through passage of H.R. 2615, the commission will serve as a vehicle to begin the work to tell the story and serve to expose the aspirations and dreams of the American people who call the Virgin Islands home. The commission will begin a national conservation, a discussion to assist in commemorating the great relationship between the United States and its islands--its American islands. The commission will allow a platform for meaningful dialogue around the Virgin Islands' history with the United States, the genesis of the issues affecting the territory, as well as how we solve them. This is an opportunity to engage lawmakers and our Nation around the challenges and enormous opportunities present in the Virgin Islands-- opportunities like our ports and transshipment position, our broadband capacity, our intellectual and artistic pursuits, our university which serves as the only [[Page H1981]] HBCU in the Caribbean, and, most important, our people. Yes, the people still waiting to be recognized and made whole in that transfer nearly a century ago. As the Virgin Islands enters this next century under United States jurisdiction, it will have continued relevance in the region as foreign investments, commerce, information technology, and maritime traffic grow in the Caribbean. It is my hope and it is my dream that its people will have greater relevance in this great Nation and that this commission will show all the importance of that. I would like to thank all of the members of the committee for supporting this bill, voting it unanimously out of committee, and thank Ranking Member Cummings and especially the chairman, Mr. Chaffetz, for working with my staff and me on this bill. {time} 1745 This bipartisan commission, which will be comprised of House and Senate Members along with the administration and other officials, seems only fitting, as the 100th anniversary comes only once. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2615. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. How can you reject that? She said it as eloquently and as passionately from her heart as you possibly could. I am pleased that we could move this forward. In short, this bill creates a bipartisan congressional commission to plan and carry out commemorative activities for the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Islands becoming an unincorporated territory of the United States. The transfer of the Virgin Islands from Denmark to the United States in 1917 was a significant historic and cultural event. Under the bill, the bipartisan commission will develop, plan, and execute formal commemorative activities to honor the rich heritage of the Virgin Islands. The commission's goal is to highlight the cultural, economic, and historical importance of the Virgin Islands. By celebrating this anniversary, the commission also has the opportunity to educate the citizens about the history of the United States Virgin Islands. The commission may solicit and accept gifts and donations to fund its activities, but there is a prohibition, as the legislation bars any use of Federal funds. Again, I thank our colleague, Stacey Plaskett, the Delegate from the Virgin Islands, for her passion and caring. It is one of the most beautiful places on the face of the planet--second, of course, to Utah's Third Congressional District. But, nevertheless, I think that is why they accepted this. I hope everybody gets a chance to visit there. My daughter--on a personal note--was able to work there this past summer for 3 months. She thoroughly enjoyed the people, the culture, and the sheer beauty that is the Virgin Islands. I look forward to supporting this piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2615, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1979-H1981] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VIRGIN ISLANDS OF THE UNITED STATES CENTENNIAL COMMISSION ACT Mr. CHAFFETZ.

General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I prefer to have the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, who is the chief sponsor of this bill, speak first on this issue. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume and thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on behalf of H.R. 2615, the Virgin Islands of the United States Centennial Commission Act. H.R. 2615 will establish a short-term commission to research, plan, develop, and carry out activities related to the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Islands becoming part of the United States. The commission will revisit the history leading up to and directly following the transfer of the islands from Denmark to the United States. Its purpose will be to educate those unaware of that history on a national level of the importance of the territories to the geopolitical advancement of this great Nation. The history of the Virgin Islands and its people is profound, Mr. Speaker. It tells a story of a land so resource-rich and unique in its geography that it was occupied by seven different nations. It tells the story of a resilient people who insurrected slavery and colonial oppression to achieve self-governance. In 1493, when Christopher Columbus landed on the island of St. Croix, which was then called Aye Aye by its native inhabitants, it is the only place in what is now the United States in which Christopher Columbus landed, but it is also reported to be the first place that he met armed resistance. He renamed islands, part of a chain, the Virgin Islands. In 1733, on the island of St. John, the slaves rose up, taking control of the island for almost a year until European powers worked together and the Danish received the help of the French and Spanish Armada to help quell what would have been and was one of the first slave uprisings in the New World. In the mid-1700s, a young boy on the island of St. Croix by the name of Alexander Hamilton received the support of merchant patrons on the island who put together sufficient money to finance his travel and education to the Colonies. He brought to the Colonies his understanding of finance and a monetary system learned from apprenticeship from those merchants, as well as the unique accounting theories from the West African slaves of the island. Those economic gifts, along with his fighting spirit for revolution, liberty, and abolitionist fervor served him and this country well, as he would soon become the first United States Secretary of the Treasury and creator of our modern financial system. Virgin Islanders have played an integral role in the history of this Nation well before we were even part of this country. From its inception and beyond, activists and politicians, David Levy Yulee, the first Jewish United States Senator; Denmark Vesey, leader of the Charleston, South Carolina, slave revolt; Judah Benjamin, Secretary of Treasury of the Confederate Army, are all Virgin Islanders. William Leidesdorff, the founder of San Francisco, and Edward Wilmot Blyden, one of the founders of Liberia, are also from the Virgin Islands. After purchase by the United States in 1917, the contributions of Virgin Islanders have continued through individuals like David Hamilton Jackson, who was a staunch free press advocate and labor movement leader; Hubert Harrison, a key figure in the movement of the Harlem Renaissance; military veterans like Alton Adams, who was the first African American naval bandleader; and General Samuel Ebbesen. Ambassador Terence Todman and Congress of Racial Equality chief, Roy Innis, are Virgin Islanders. Actor Kelsey Grammer and future NBA Hall- of-Famer Timothy Duncan are all from the Virgin Islands. The first female physician of this body as a Member of Congress, my predecessor, Donna Christensen, is a Virgin Islander. During the time of exploration and slave trade, our geographic location made us a hub of Western Hemisphere commerce for several centuries and served a crucial role in naval military activity in the Caribbean Basin. So nearly a century ago, the United States purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark for its geographic importance. On March 31, 2017, the Virgin Islands of the United States will celebrate 100 years as a possession and part of the union of the United States. This bill, H.R. 2615, establishes the Virgin Islands of the United States Centennial Commission to research, plan, develop, and carry out activities the commission considers appropriate to commemorate--and I say commemorate, not celebrate--commemorate a more solemn and worthy endeavor, the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Islands of the United States becoming an unincorporated territory of the United States.

Ambassador Terence Todman and Congress of Racial Equality chief, Roy Innis, are Virgin Islanders. Actor Kelsey Grammer and future NBA Hall- of-Famer Timothy Duncan are all from the Virgin Islands. The first female physician of this body as a Member of Congress, my predecessor, Donna Christensen, is a Virgin Islander. During the time of exploration and slave trade, our geographic location made us a hub of Western Hemisphere commerce for several centuries and served a crucial role in naval military activity in the Caribbean Basin. So nearly a century ago, the United States purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark for its geographic importance. On March 31, 2017, the Virgin Islands of the United States will celebrate 100 years as a possession and part of the union of the United States. This bill, H.R. 2615, establishes the Virgin Islands of the United States Centennial Commission to research, plan, develop, and carry out activities the commission considers appropriate to commemorate--and I say commemorate, not celebrate--commemorate a more solemn and worthy endeavor, the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Islands of the United States becoming an unincorporated territory of the United States. Now, I have spent a lot of time talking about the Virgin Islands' history and people because at the time of its transfer nearly 100 years ago, little thought was given to the history, and even less to the people of the Virgin Islands. As the Islanders during that time, my ancestors, my grandparents, watched the Danish flag come down and the Stars and Stripes unfold and ripple over the Fort in Christiansted and over many places in the Virgin Islands, they thought out loud: We knew what we had, but we don't know what we are going to get. Our elders and leaders hoped and believed that the purchase by the United States would herald greater opportunities and profound modernization. Unfortunately, this has not happened. It took a decade of petitioning and lobbying to be given citizenship, and we asked for--we asked for it and petitioned again to be part of the draft. What people willingly offer their sons to fight and die, except those wholly willing to be part of the entire American experience? Even now we have greater casualties per capita than any other group in this Nation in a volunteer military and is an example in part of our valor and patriotism. Through passage of H.R. 2615, the commission will serve as a vehicle to begin the work to tell the story and serve to expose the aspirations and dreams of the American people who call the Virgin Islands home. The commission will begin a national conservation, a discussion to assist in commemorating the great relationship between the United States and its islands--its American islands. The commission will allow a platform for meaningful dialogue around the Virgin Islands' history with the United States, the genesis of the issues affecting the territory, as well as how we solve them. This is an opportunity to engage lawmakers and our Nation around the challenges and enormous opportunities present in the Virgin Islands-- opportunities like our ports and transshipment position, our broadband capacity, our intellectual and artistic pursuits, our university which serves as the only [[Page H1981]] HBCU in the Caribbean, and, most important, our people. Yes, the people still waiting to be recognized and made whole in that transfer nearly a century ago. As the Virgin Islands enters this next century under United States jurisdiction, it will have continued relevance in the region as foreign investments, commerce, information technology, and maritime traffic grow in the Caribbean. It is my hope and it is my dream that its people will have greater relevance in this great Nation and that this commission will show all the importance of that. I would like to thank all of the members of the committee for supporting this bill, voting it unanimously out of committee, and thank Ranking Member Cummings and especially the chairman, Mr. Chaffetz, for working with my staff and me on this bill. {time} 1745 This bipartisan commission, which will be comprised of House and Senate Members along with the administration and other officials, seems only fitting, as the 100th anniversary comes only once. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2615. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. How can you reject that? She said it as eloquently and as passionately from her heart as you possibly could. I am pleased that we could move this forward. In short, this bill creates a bipartisan congressional commission to plan and carry out commemorative activities for the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Islands becoming an unincorporated territory of the United States. The transfer of the Virgin Islands from Denmark to the United States in 1917 was a significant historic and cultural event. Under the bill, the bipartisan commission will develop, plan, and execute formal commemorative activities to honor the rich heritage of the Virgin Islands. The commission's goal is to highlight the cultural, economic, and historical importance of the Virgin Islands. By celebrating this anniversary, the commission also has the opportunity to educate the citizens about the history of the United States Virgin Islands. The commission may solicit and accept gifts and donations to fund its activities, but there is a prohibition, as the legislation bars any use of Federal funds. Again, I thank our colleague, Stacey Plaskett, the Delegate from the Virgin Islands, for her passion and caring. It is one of the most beautiful places on the face of the planet--second, of course, to Utah's Third Congressional District. But, nevertheless, I think that is why they accepted this. I hope everybody gets a chance to visit there. My daughter--on a personal note--was able to work there this past summer for 3 months. She thoroughly enjoyed the people, the culture, and the sheer beauty that is the Virgin Islands. I look forward to supporting this piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2615, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,18985,18985,19053,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [house] [pages h1979-h1981] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] virgin islands of the united states centennial commission act mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 2615) to establish the virgin islands of the united states centennial commission, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 2615 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``virgin islands of the united states centennial commission act''. sec. 2. establishment. there is established a commission to be known as the ``virgin islands of the united states centennial commission'' (in this act referred to as the ``commission''). sec. 3. duties of commission. the commission shall-- (1) plan, develop, and carry out such activities as the commission determines to be appropriate to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the virgin islands of the united states becoming an unincorporated territory of the united states; (2) provide advice and assistance to federal, state, and local governmental agencies, as well as civic groups to carry out activities to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the virgin islands of the united states becoming an unincorporated territory of the united states; and (3) submit to the president and congress the reports required pursuant to section 7. sec. 4. membership.

this issue. i reserve the balance of my time. ms. plaskett. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume and thank the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) for yielding. mr. speaker, i rise to speak on behalf of h.r. 2615, the virgin islands of the united states centennial commission act. h.r. 2615 will establish a short-term commission to research, plan, develop, and carry out activities related to the 100th anniversary of the virgin islands becoming part of the united states. the commission will revisit the history leading up to and directly following the transfer of the islands from denmark to the united states. its purpose will be to educate those unaware of that history on a national level of the importance of the territories to the geopolitical advancement of this great nation. the history of the virgin islands and its people is profound, mr. speaker. it tells a story of a land so resource-rich and unique in its geography that it was occupied by seven different nations. it tells the story of a resilient people who insurrected slavery and colonial oppression to achieve self-governance. in 1493, when christopher columbus landed on the island of st. croix, which was then called aye aye by its native inhabitants, it is the only place in what is now the united states in which christopher columbus landed, but it is also reported to be the first place that he met armed resistance. he renamed islands, part of a chain, the virgin islands. in 1733, on the island of st. john, the slaves rose up, taking control of the island for almost a year until european powers worked together and the danish received the help of the french and spanish armada to help quell what would have been and was one of the first slave uprisings in the new world. in the mid-1700s, a young boy on the island of st. croix by the name of alexander hamilton received the support of merchant patrons on the island who put together sufficient money to finance his travel and education to the colonies. he brought to the colonies his understanding of finance and a monetary system learned from apprenticeship from those merchants, as well as the unique accounting theories from the west african slaves of the island. those economic gifts, along with his fighting spirit for revolution, liberty, and abolitionist fervor served him and this country well, as he would soon become the first united states secretary of the treasury and creator of our modern financial system. virgin islanders have played an integral role in the history of this nation well before we were even part of this country. from its inception and beyond, activists and politicians, david levy yulee, the first jewish united states senator; denmark vesey, leader of the charleston, south carolina, slave revolt; judah benjamin, secretary of treasury of the confederate army, are all virgin islanders. william leidesdorff, the founder of san francisco, and edward wilmot blyden, one of the founders of liberia, are also from the virgin islands. after purchase by the united states in 1917, the contributions of virgin islanders have continued through individuals like david hamilton jackson, who was a staunch free press advocate and labor movement leader; hubert harrison, a key figure in the movement of the harlem renaissance; military veterans like alton adams, who was the first african american naval bandleader; and general samuel ebbesen. ambassador terence todman and congress of racial equality chief, roy innis, are virgin islanders. actor kelsey grammer and future nba hall- of-famer timothy

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The vast majority of Federal workers are patriotic, they are honest, they are decent, they work hard, they show up early, they do what they are supposed to do, and they are proud to serve their country and provide their role in when they do. For that, we are very grateful. But like any large group of people, there are some bad apples. If you go through the barrel, you are going to find a few bad apples. We have a responsibility to make sure that we weed those out. These individuals must be treated fairly, but they must be held accountable. H.R. 4360 is a bill that accomplishes this balance and that strengthens the integrity of our civil service. {time} 1800 Under the current system, a loophole allows Federal employees who are [[Page H1984]] guilty of serious, but not necessarily criminal, infractions to leave Federal service before an investigation is completed and join a new agency without that new agency ever becoming aware of those previous issues. Unfortunately, in our work on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, we have had some examples of this. H.R. 4360 corrects this problem by requiring a notation to be made in the employee's official personnel file if an investigation leads to an adverse finding against that person even if the employee has already resigned. For example, under the current system, Federal employees who commit some form of misconduct or poor performance could resign from their positions and escape accountability. This is exactly what occurred at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As part of an investigation, the Department of Commerce, Office of the Inspector General requested that a patent examiner attend a voluntary interview with the Office of the Inspector General. However, 2 hours before the interview with the OIG, the patent examiner resigned. In an instant message with a coworker, the examiner explained that the union recommended that he resign in order to have a clean slate, with no record of conduct or performance issues, if he applied to work for another agency. We cannot continue to have a system that creates loopholes for an individual to elude accountability by simply having to submit a piece of paper on a napkin--or something as simple as that--and writing, ``I hereby resign,'' and then keeping his record clean so he can get another job. Mr. Speaker, another example is of a similar event that unfolded with an Interior Department employee who was under investigation for lying about his education credentials. After being interviewed by the Interior Department's Office of Inspector General, this individual resigned from the Interior and later joined the Census Bureau; but when he went over to the Census Bureau, the Census Bureau was unaware of the history until well after it had hired this person. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4360 remedies the scenarios I just discussed, thereby helping to protect agencies from making employment hires when having incomplete pictures of the individuals' backgrounds. This has happened on several occasions. It is almost disappointing that one has to go forward and legislate this, but given that it is happening, it is the responsible thing to do, and we have come together in a good, bipartisan way to make this happen. Specifically under this legislation, separated employees will have notations made in their official personnel files if they resign while under investigation and if those investigations lead to adverse findings. Additionally, if the individuals apply for other positions in the Federal Government, those notations will follow them as agencies will now be required to examine the personnel files of former Federal employees during the hiring process. Bad actors should not be able to resign from government service with clean slates and effectively dupe another agency that will then be hiring them. However, this bill also ensures that separated employees are provided the opportunity to contest the findings of an investigation. I think that is a fair and just way for them to be able to clean their records if they think that they have cases to be made. By working closely with my Democratic colleagues, we were able to build a process into this legislation that gives former employees a mechanism by which to fairly present their cases in the event an investigation leads to an adverse finding. Mr. Speaker, it is also important to note that H.R. 4360 does nothing to diminish the rights or protections that are afforded to whistleblowers. This is a bill to prevent individuals from maneuvering within the Federal Government in order to hide their misconduct. It is that simple. I urge its passage. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 4360, the Official Personnel File Enhancement Act, addresses a legitimate concern of employees who resign their positions during pending investigations or adverse disciplinary actions and then reapply for employment elsewhere in the Federal Government. I think we can agree that measures need to be taken to prevent such incidents from happening in order to protect the integrity of the Federal workforce. I thank Chairman Chaffetz for working with the minority and, particularly, for working with Congressman Connolly from Virginia to address our concerns with the original bill. The introduced version of this legislation would have allowed an agency to put a permanent notation of an investigative finding in an employee's file without giving the employee an opportunity to respond. The bill, as reported, would preserve the principles of due process that help to protect our Federal employees from arbitrary acts and political influence. It would provide a former employee with notice and opportunity to respond to an adverse investigative finding before a notation is placed in the individual's personnel file. The legislation also gives the individual the right to appeal the agency's decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which we believe is the appropriate place for that. These due process protections are consistent with our Constitution and with the fundamental American principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty. I understand that some concerns have been raised regarding how the legislation would be implemented. We hope to address those concerns as the bill moves forward in the legislative process. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4360. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I urge the passage of H.R. 4360. I believe this is a good bill. We worked in a good, bipartisan way. It does make the system more fair and it makes it more accountable. It makes sure, for those who have adverse actions, that they can't simply skirt away from their responsibilities. It does hold people accountable. To that effect, it is a good bill, and I urge its passage. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4360, the Official Personnel File Enhancement Act. As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, myself and other committee members are constantly reading reports of and investigating instances of employee misconduct and performance shortcomings. Yet too often, these investigations come up empty because the employee decided to resign or otherwise leave federal service before the investigation is over, thereby ending the investigation. I cannot tell you how frustrating this is. These investigations must be completed, and any employee seeking to return to federal service must have the results of that investigation as a part their record. We owe it to the American taxpayer to ensure that the federal government only hires the most qualified and honorable employees. H.R. 4360 will allow that to happen. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4360, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The vast majority of Federal workers are patriotic, they are honest, they are decent, they work hard, they show up early, they do what they are supposed to do, and they are proud to serve their country and provide their role in when they do. For that, we are very grateful. But like any large group of people, there are some bad apples. If you go through the barrel, you are going to find a few bad apples. We have a responsibility to make sure that we weed those out. These individuals must be treated fairly, but they must be held accountable. H.R. 4360 is a bill that accomplishes this balance and that strengthens the integrity of our civil service. {time} 1800 Under the current system, a loophole allows Federal employees who are [[Page H1984]] guilty of serious, but not necessarily criminal, infractions to leave Federal service before an investigation is completed and join a new agency without that new agency ever becoming aware of those previous issues. Unfortunately, in our work on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, we have had some examples of this. H.R. 4360 corrects this problem by requiring a notation to be made in the employee's official personnel file if an investigation leads to an adverse finding against that person even if the employee has already resigned. For example, under the current system, Federal employees who commit some form of misconduct or poor performance could resign from their positions and escape accountability. This is exactly what occurred at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As part of an investigation, the Department of Commerce, Office of the Inspector General requested that a patent examiner attend a voluntary interview with the Office of the Inspector General. However, 2 hours before the interview with the OIG, the patent examiner resigned. In an instant message with a coworker, the examiner explained that the union recommended that he resign in order to have a clean slate, with no record of conduct or performance issues, if he applied to work for another agency. We cannot continue to have a system that creates loopholes for an individual to elude accountability by simply having to submit a piece of paper on a napkin--or something as simple as that--and writing, ``I hereby resign,'' and then keeping his record clean so he can get another job. Mr. Speaker, another example is of a similar event that unfolded with an Interior Department employee who was under investigation for lying about his education credentials. After being interviewed by the Interior Department's Office of Inspector General, this individual resigned from the Interior and later joined the Census Bureau; but when he went over to the Census Bureau, the Census Bureau was unaware of the history until well after it had hired this person. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4360 remedies the scenarios I just discussed, thereby helping to protect agencies from making employment hires when having incomplete pictures of the individuals' backgrounds. This has happened on several occasions. It is almost disappointing that one has to go forward and legislate this, but given that it is happening, it is the responsible thing to do, and we have come together in a good, bipartisan way to make this happen. Specifically under this legislation, separated employees will have notations made in their official personnel files if they resign while under investigation and if those investigations lead to adverse findings. Additionally, if the individuals apply for other positions in the Federal Government, those notations will follow them as agencies will now be required to examine the personnel files of former Federal employees during the hiring process. Bad actors should not be able to resign from government service with clean slates and effectively dupe another agency that will then be hiring them. However, this bill also ensures that separated employees are provided the opportunity to contest the findings of an investigation. I think that is a fair and just way for them to be able to clean their records if they think that they have cases to be made. By working closely with my Democratic colleagues, we were able to build a process into this legislation that gives former employees a mechanism by which to fairly present their cases in the event an investigation leads to an adverse finding. Mr. Speaker, it is also important to note that H.R. 4360 does nothing to diminish the rights or protections that are afforded to whistleblowers. This is a bill to prevent individuals from maneuvering within the Federal Government in order to hide their misconduct. It is that simple. I urge its passage. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 4360, the Official Personnel File Enhancement Act, addresses a legitimate concern of employees who resign their positions during pending investigations or adverse disciplinary actions and then reapply for employment elsewhere in the Federal Government.

will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from utah. general leave mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from utah? there was no objection. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. the vast majority of federal workers are patriotic, they are honest, they are decent, they work hard, they show up early, they do what they are supposed to do, and they are proud to serve their country and provide their role in when they do. for that, we are very grateful. but like any large group of people, there are some bad apples. if you go through the barrel, you are going to find a few bad apples. we have a responsibility to make sure that we weed those out. these individuals must be treated fairly, but they must be held accountable. h.r. 4360 is a bill that accomplishes this balance and that strengthens the integrity of our civil service. {time} 1800 under the current system, a loophole allows federal employees who are [[page h1984]] guilty of serious, but not necessarily criminal, infractions to leave federal service before an investigation is completed and join a new agency without that new agency ever becoming aware of those previous issues. unfortunately, in our work on the committee on oversight and government reform, we have had some examples of this. h.r. 4360 corrects this problem by requiring a notation to be made in the employee's official personnel file if an investigation leads to an adverse finding against that person even if the employee has already resigned. for example, under the current system, federal employees who commit some form of misconduct or poor performance could resign from their positions and escape accountability. this is exactly what occurred at the united states patent and trademark office. as part of an investigation, the department of commerce, office of the inspector general requested that a patent examiner attend a voluntary interview with the office of the inspector general. however, 2 hours before the interview with the oig, the patent examiner resigned. in an instant message with a coworker, the examiner explained that the union recommended that he resign in order to have a clean slate, with no record of conduct or performance issues, if he applied to work for another agency. we cannot continue to have a system that creates loopholes for an individual to elude accountability by simply having to submit a piece of paper on a napkin--or something as simple as that--and writing, ``i hereby resign,'' and then keeping his record clean so he can get another job. mr. speaker, another example is of a similar event that unfolded with an interior department employee who was under investigation for lying about his education credentials. after being interviewed by the interior department's office of inspector general, this individual resigned from the interior and later joined the census bureau; but when he went over to the census bureau, the census bureau was unaware of the history until well after it had hired this person. mr. speaker, h.r. 4360 remedies the scenarios i just discussed, thereby helping to protect agencies from making employment hires when having incomplete pictures of the individuals' backgrounds. this has happened on several occasions. it is almost disappointing that one has to go forward and legislate this, but given that it is happening, it is the responsible thing to do, and we have come together in a good, bipartisan way to make this happen. specifically under this legislation, separated employees will have notations made in their official personnel files if they resign while under investigation and if those investigations lead to adverse findings. additionally, if the individuals apply for other positions in the federal government, those notations will follow them as agencies will now be required to examine the personnel files of former federal employees during the hiring process. bad actors should not be able to resign from government service with clean slates and effectively dupe another agency that will then be hiring them. however, this bill also ensures that separated employees are provided the opportunity to contest the findings of an investigation. i think that is a fair and just way for them to be able to clean their records if they think that they have cases to be made. by working closely with my democratic colleagues, we were able to build a process into this legislation that gives former employees a mechanism by which to fairly present their cases in the event an investigation leads to an adverse finding. mr. speaker, it is also important to note that h.r. 4360 does nothing to diminish the rights or protections that are afforded to whistleblowers. this is a bill to prevent individuals from maneuvering within the federal government in order to hide their misconduct. it is that simple. i urge its passage. i reserve the balance of my time. ms. plaskett. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. h.r. 4360, the official personnel file enhancement act, addresses a legitimate concern of employees who resign their positions during pending investigations or adverse disciplinary actions and then reapply for employment elsewhere in the federal government. i think we can agree that measures need to be taken to prevent such incidents from happening in order to protect the integrity of the federal workforce. i thank chairman chaffetz for working with the minority and, particularly, for working with congressman connolly from virginia to address our concerns with the original bill. the introduced version of this legislation would have allowed an agency to put a permanent notation of an investigative finding in an employee's file without giving the employee an opportunity to respond. the bill, as reported, would preserve the principles of due process that help to protect our federal employees from arbitrary acts and political influence. it would provide a former employee with notice and opportunity to respond to an adverse investigative finding before a notation is placed in the individual's personnel file. the legislation also gives the individual the right to appeal the agency's decision to the merit systems protection board, which we believe is the appropriate place for that. these due process protections are consistent with our constitution and with the fundamental american principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty. i understand that some concerns have been raised regarding how the legislation would be implemented. we hope to address those concerns as the bill moves forward in the legislative process. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting h.r. 4360. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i urge the passage of h.r. 4360. i believe this is a good bill. we worked in a good, bipartisan way. it does make the system more fair and it makes it more accountable. it makes sure, for those who have adverse actions, that they can't simply skirt away from their responsibilities. it does hold people accountable. to that effect, it is a good bill, and i urge its passage. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. abraham. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 4360, the official personnel file enhancement act. as a member of the house veterans affairs committee, myself and other committee members are constantly reading reports of and investigating instances of employee misconduct and performance shortcomings. yet too often, these investigations come up empty because the employee decided to resign or otherwise leave federal service before the investigation is over, thereby ending the investigation. i cannot tell you how frustrating this is. these investigations must be completed, and any employee seeking to return to federal service must have the results of that investigation as a part their record. we owe it to the american taxpayer to ensure that the federal government only hires the most qualified and honorable employees. h.r. 4360 will allow that to happen. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 4360, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",15025

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material into the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I acknowledge the ranking member, Mr. Eliot Engel from New York, for his outstanding leadership on this legislation. With its passage today, his H.R. 1493, the Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act, will head to the President's desk for his signature. This is a critical measure. The Islamic State, or ISIS, continues to wreak havoc throughout Iraq and Syria. It is laying a path of death and destruction in its wake, and it has inspired deadly attacks around the world and deadly attacks here at home. No offense is more appalling than the terrorists' complete disregard for human life. As this body has recognized, ISIS is waging a genocide against religious minorities in the Middle East. I recently had the opportunity to talk to some of those Yazidi girls and Christian minorities about what they had been through, as well as to talk to Sunni and Kurdish families. It has unleashed a campaign of sickening violence against Muslims who do not share its radical beliefs and against the other religious minorities across the Middle East and beyond. Besides the human toll of ISIS' deplorable acts, we also mourn the tremendous loss of cultural heritage as these extremists loot and destroy their way through ancient sites in the territories that they conquer. We have seen sickening footage of ISIS' drilling its way through priceless artifacts in Mosul and in its bulldozing of magnificent Mesopotamian ruins in the 3,000-year-old city of Nimrud. [[Page H1986]] ISIS claims the annihilation of cultural sites is meant to counter idol worship, but clearly these terrorists have another goal: to remove all traces of the region's rich and diverse religious and cultural past. It is in line with what the Nazis tried to do in burning the books across Europe in trying to burn history that predated them. By eliminating all evidence of religious pluralism and by eliminating all evidence of humanity's common heritage, it is paving the way for its own horrifying brand of radical Islamist extremism. The looting of antiquities is big business for ISIS. Experts estimate that the group has earned millions of dollars from the sale of stolen artifacts every year, which are often peddled by middlemen in old- fashioned markets or online. Unfortunately, buyers in the U.S. appear to be a primary end destination for many of these pieces, as does Europe, as does Asia. Mr. Speaker, I just returned from the Middle East. I was honored to speak at the Iraq Museum in Baghdad about the need to counter ISIS' trafficking of priceless antiquities. This region is steeped in history from the rise and fall of empires to the evolution of writing and mathematics and art. Much of this heritage remains at risk due to looting by ISIS and, I should add, by other parties to the conflict in Syria, including the murderous Assad regime. That is why last year, Ranking Member Eliot Engel and I introduced this legislation, which will help the U.S. do its part to counter this black market trade. Specifically, this legislation will prevent those antiquities that have been removed since the start of Syria's civil war from being sold or imported into the United States. This will reduce funding to ISIS and will disincentivize future looting. Again, I thank the ranking member, as well as Representatives Smith and Keating, for all of their work on this measure. I also acknowledge the bill's Senate cosponsors--Senators Casey and Perdue and Grassley, as well as Chairman Corker and Ranking Member Cardin of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations--whose leadership was instrumental to this measure's passage by Mr. Engel in the Senate. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of this legislation. First of all, I thank our chairman, Ed Royce, for his leadership on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and for pushing this bill ahead. I don't want to underestimate how important he has been in making sure that this bill reaches the floor. I thank Congressman Chris Smith for joining me as a lead Republican cosponsor on this measure, and I thank our Senate colleagues for their work to help get us to this point. This legislation is another great example of the Committee on Foreign Affairs' working across the aisle to get results because we believe, again, that foreign policy should be bipartisan and that partisanship should stop at the water's edge. When the House finishes its work on this bill today, it will be on its way to the President's desk, and that is something of which we should all be proud. Mr. Speaker, since the time ISIS emerged as a factor in Iraq and in Syria, we have read reports, have seen images, and have watched videos of ISIS terrorists in their destroying of ancient structures and artifacts in the areas they control. It is actually heartbreaking. These fanatics literally want to wipe away history. They want to destroy any trace of culture or belief system that doesn't conform to their twisted ideology and twisted way of thinking, but that is not the whole story. ISIS has also seized on cultural artifacts as a funding source. If you look at satellite pictures of heritage sites that ISIS controls, you can pick out thousands of small holes in the desert. ISIS has looted these areas, has dug up coins and statues and anything else it can carry, and has trafficked those items on the black market. As a result, millions of dollars have flowed into ISIS' coffers. So a few years ago I knew we needed to do more to combat this serious problem. With the help of several colleagues--and, again, I emphasize how helpful the chairman has been--I set out to help preserve this history and, at the same time, to cut off a vital revenue stream for these terrorists. I was confident we could do it because we have done it before. During the Iraq war, we also saw the looting of antiquities. So we passed legislation then to impose import restrictions on those items coming in from Iraq. {time} 1816 I decided that we needed to take similar steps with respect to items coming out of Syria. So we got to work, talking to experts and officials to find the best ways of stopping looted goods arriving on our shores and to make sure those goods aren't sold to help ISIS' campaign of violence. It is really disgraceful that anyone in the United States would buy these things. Those proven practices and innovative approaches are at the core of this bill. These restrictions would bring the United States in line with the U.N. Security Council resolution passed unanimously last year. That resolution called on all States to deny funding to ISIS by preventing trade in Iraqi and Syrian cultural property. Our European partners have already stepped up and enacted similar measures. That is good news because it is going to take a wide-ranging effort to effectively crack down on this illegal marketplace. My bill would also encourage administration agencies already working on this problem to collaborate more closely so that our efforts are more streamlined and efficient. Finally, it is important to note that the legislation would not prevent the importation of Syrian artifacts for preservation or restoration. So this is a good bill. I have been working on it for several years. I am proud of everything that has gone into it by my colleagues and our staff members. I am glad, once again, that we are working in a bipartisan way to pass legislation that advances our interests, and I am very grateful that we are so close to the finish line on this bill. So I want to thank everybody. I want to especially thank Chairman Royce once again. I ask that all Members support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is always a great feeling to cross the finish line on a piece of legislation. At our best, that is what the Foreign Affairs Committee does, and we are at our best here this day. So I again want to thank Chairman Royce for his leadership and partnership. I want to thank our Senate colleagues for doing their part. I want to thank the staff that worked so hard on this bill. We should be seizing every available opportunity to cut off resources to ISIS and other terrorist groups. This legislation goes after a practice that has put millions of dollars in ISIS' hands and has resulted in the irreversible destruction of some of history's greatest artifacts. So it destroys these artifacts, which is bad enough, but then it puts money in ISIS' hands. They actually make money by doing it. It is aiding and abetting terrorism. So it is a double whammy. We knew from past experience that the approach laid out in this bill works. It is long past due that we ramp up our efforts to stop the looting, stop the trafficking, and stop the destruction. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and send it to the President. I know that the President will sign it. It is very important. I hope we will soon see this legislation enacted and on the books. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Again, I thank Mr. Eliot Engel of New York for this legislation. The ancient cities now facing destruction at the hands of ISIS are considered the birthplace of modern civilization. As we stand here on the floor of the House, we see behind us the relief of the great lawgivers. First, there is Moses. Next to him is Hammurabi for Hammurabi's Code, the great lawgivers and heroes of liberty. We think about the fact that, in this part of the world, these antiquities are now in the hands of ISIS. [[Page H1987]] As one expert told the Financial Services Committee's Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing last week, this is where the Acadian King Hammurabi ruled at the beginning of the second millennium BC and where the Hebrew prophet Jonah preached successfully repentance to the Assyrian Ninevites 1,000 years later. Now, in 2015, ISIS has as many as 4,500 cultural sites under its control. A raid carried out last year by U.S. Special Forces revealed that ISIS has invested heavily in the looting and smuggling of antiquities in the region as they cut up antiquities and then try to trade them for hard currency. The legislation before us today is an important step toward curbing this illicit trade and limiting funding to these terrorists. I do want to note that the bill's emergency import restrictions are not designed to continue in perpetuity and can be waived under certain conditions for the temporary safeguarding of cultural property in the United States. The bill also presses the administration to increase accountability for U.S. efforts to protect cultural property overseas and improves congressional oversight of this work. I appreciate the other committees of jurisdiction for working with the Foreign Affairs Committee on this measure, particularly the Committee on Ways and Means for its assistance on the cultural import restrictions in this bill. Lastly, I want to recognize the work of the committee staff on this important legislation, particularly Jessica Kelch, who, along with Mark Iozzi on Mr. Engel's staff and Kristen Marquardt on the Foreign Affairs Committee staff, worked out all the complexities to deliver what I am confident will be effective legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 1493. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material into the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I acknowledge the ranking member, Mr. Eliot Engel from New York, for his outstanding leadership on this legislation. With its passage today, his H.R. 1493, the Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act, will head to the President's desk for his signature. This is a critical measure. The Islamic State, or ISIS, continues to wreak havoc throughout Iraq and Syria. It is laying a path of death and destruction in its wake, and it has inspired deadly attacks around the world and deadly attacks here at home. No offense is more appalling than the terrorists' complete disregard for human life. As this body has recognized, ISIS is waging a genocide against religious minorities in the Middle East. I recently had the opportunity to talk to some of those Yazidi girls and Christian minorities about what they had been through, as well as to talk to Sunni and Kurdish families. It has unleashed a campaign of sickening violence against Muslims who do not share its radical beliefs and against the other religious minorities across the Middle East and beyond. Besides the human toll of ISIS' deplorable acts, we also mourn the tremendous loss of cultural heritage as these extremists loot and destroy their way through ancient sites in the territories that they conquer. We have seen sickening footage of ISIS' drilling its way through priceless artifacts in Mosul and in its bulldozing of magnificent Mesopotamian ruins in the 3,000-year-old city of Nimrud. [[Page H1986]] ISIS claims the annihilation of cultural sites is meant to counter idol worship, but clearly these terrorists have another goal: to remove all traces of the region's rich and diverse religious and cultural past. It is in line with what the Nazis tried to do in burning the books across Europe in trying to burn history that predated them. By eliminating all evidence of religious pluralism and by eliminating all evidence of humanity's common heritage, it is paving the way for its own horrifying brand of radical Islamist extremism. The looting of antiquities is big business for ISIS. Experts estimate that the group has earned millions of dollars from the sale of stolen artifacts every year, which are often peddled by middlemen in old- fashioned markets or online. Unfortunately, buyers in the U.S. appear to be a primary end destination for many of these pieces, as does Europe, as does Asia. Mr. Speaker, I just returned from the Middle East. I was honored to speak at the Iraq Museum in Baghdad about the need to counter ISIS' trafficking of priceless antiquities. This region is steeped in history from the rise and fall of empires to the evolution of writing and mathematics and art. Much of this heritage remains at risk due to looting by ISIS and, I should add, by other parties to the conflict in Syria, including the murderous Assad regime. That is why last year, Ranking Member Eliot Engel and I introduced this legislation, which will help the U.S. do its part to counter this black market trade. Specifically, this legislation will prevent those antiquities that have been removed since the start of Syria's civil war from being sold or imported into the United States. This will reduce funding to ISIS and will disincentivize future looting. Again, I thank the ranking member, as well as Representatives Smith and Keating, for all of their work on this measure. I also acknowledge the bill's Senate cosponsors--Senators Casey and Perdue and Grassley, as well as Chairman Corker and Ranking Member Cardin of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations--whose leadership was instrumental to this measure's passage by Mr. Engel in the Senate. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of this legislation. First of all, I thank our chairman, Ed Royce, for his leadership on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and for pushing this bill ahead. I don't want to underestimate how important he has been in making sure that this bill reaches the floor. I thank Congressman Chris Smith for joining me as a lead Republican cosponsor on this measure, and I thank our Senate colleagues for their work to help get us to this point. This legislation is another great example of the Committee on Foreign Affairs' working across the aisle to get results because we believe, again, that foreign policy should be bipartisan and that partisanship should stop at the water's edge. When the House finishes its work on this bill today, it will be on its way to the President's desk, and that is something of which we should all be proud. Mr. Speaker, since the time ISIS emerged as a factor in Iraq and in Syria, we have read reports, have seen images, and have watched videos of ISIS terrorists in their destroying of ancient structures and artifacts in the areas they control. It is actually heartbreaking. These fanatics literally want to wipe away history. They want to destroy any trace of culture or belief system that doesn't conform to their twisted ideology and twisted way of thinking, but that is not the whole story. ISIS has also seized on cultural artifacts as a funding source. If you look at satellite pictures of heritage sites that ISIS controls, you can pick out thousands of small holes in the desert. ISIS has looted these areas, has dug up coins and statues and anything else it can carry, and has trafficked those items on the black market. As a result, millions of dollars have flowed into ISIS' coffers. So a few years ago I knew we needed to do more to combat this serious problem. With the help of several colleagues--and, again, I emphasize how helpful the chairman has been--I set out to help preserve this history and, at the same time, to cut off a vital revenue stream for these terrorists. I was confident we could do it because we have done it before. During the Iraq war, we also saw the looting of antiquities. So we passed legislation then to impose import restrictions on those items coming in from Iraq. {time} 1816 I decided that we needed to take similar steps with respect to items coming out of Syria. So we got to work, talking to experts and officials to find the best ways of stopping looted goods arriving on our shores and to make sure those goods aren't sold to help ISIS' campaign of violence. It is really disgraceful that anyone in the United States would buy these things. Those proven practices and innovative approaches are at the core of this bill. These restrictions would bring the United States in line with the U.N. Security Council resolution passed unanimously last year. That resolution called on all States to deny funding to ISIS by preventing trade in Iraqi and Syrian cultural property. Our European partners have already stepped up and enacted similar measures. That is good news because it is going to take a wide-ranging effort to effectively crack down on this illegal marketplace. My bill would also encourage administration agencies already working on this problem to collaborate more closely so that our efforts are more streamlined and efficient. Finally, it is important to note that the legislation would not prevent the importation of Syrian artifacts for preservation or restoration. So this is a good bill. I have been working on it for several years. I am proud of everything that has gone into it by my colleagues and our staff members. I am glad, once again, that we are working in a bipartisan way to pass legislation that advances our interests, and I am very grateful that we are so close to the finish line on this bill. So I want to thank everybody. I want to especially thank Chairman Royce once again. I ask that all Members support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is always a great feeling to cross the finish line on a piece of legislation. At our best, that is what the Foreign Affairs Committee does, and we are at our best here this day. So I again want to thank Chairman Royce for his leadership and partnership. I want to thank our Senate colleagues for doing their part. I want to thank the staff that worked so hard on this bill. We should be seizing every available opportunity to cut off resources to ISIS and other terrorist groups. This legislation goes after a practice that has put millions of dollars in ISIS' hands and has resulted in the irreversible destruction of some of history's greatest artifacts. So it destroys these artifacts, which is bad enough, but then it puts money in ISIS' hands. They actually make money by doing it. It is aiding and abetting terrorism. So it is a double whammy. We knew from past experience that the approach laid out in this bill works. It is long past due that we ramp up our efforts to stop the looting, stop the trafficking, and stop the destruction. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and send it to the President. I know that the President will sign it. It is very important. I hope we will soon see this legislation enacted and on the books. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Again, I thank Mr. Eliot Engel of New York for this legislation. The ancient cities now facing destruction at the hands of ISIS are considered the birthplace of modern civilization. As we stand here on the floor of the House, we see behind us the relief of the great lawgivers. First, there is Moses. Next to him is Hammurabi for Hammurabi's Code, the great lawgivers and heroes of liberty. We think about the fact that, in this part of the world, these antiquities are now in the hands of ISIS. [[Page H1987]] As one expert told the Financial Services Committee's Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing last week, this is where the Acadian King Hammurabi ruled at the beginning of the second millennium BC and where the Hebrew prophet Jonah preached successfully repentance to the Assyrian Ninevites 1,000 years later. Now, in 2015, ISIS has as many as 4,500 cultural sites under its control. A raid carried out last year by U.S. Special Forces revealed that ISIS has invested heavily in the looting and smuggling of antiquities in the region as they cut up antiquities and then try to trade them for hard currency. The legislation before us today is an important step toward curbing this illicit trade and limiting funding to these terrorists. I do want to note that the bill's emergency import restrictions are not designed to continue in perpetuity and can be waived under certain conditions for the temporary safeguarding of cultural property in the United States. The bill also presses the administration to increase accountability for U.S. efforts to protect cultural property overseas and improves congressional oversight of this work. I appreciate the other committees of jurisdiction for working with the Foreign Affairs Committee on this measure, particularly the Committee on Ways and Means for its assistance on the cultural import restrictions in this bill. Lastly, I want to recognize the work of the committee staff on this important legislation, particularly Jessica Kelch, who, along with Mark Iozzi on Mr. Engel's staff and Kristen Marquardt on the Foreign Affairs Committee staff, worked out all the complexities to deliver what I am confident will be effective legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 1493. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1984-H1987] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECT AND PRESERVE INTERNATIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTY ACT Mr. ROYCE.

I have been working on it for several years. I am proud of everything that has gone into it by my colleagues and our staff members. I am glad, once again, that we are working in a bipartisan way to pass legislation that advances our interests, and I am very grateful that we are so close to the finish line on this bill. So I want to thank everybody. I want to especially thank Chairman Royce once again. I ask that all Members support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is always a great feeling to cross the finish line on a piece of legislation. At our best, that is what the Foreign Affairs Committee does, and we are at our best here this day. So I again want to thank Chairman Royce for his leadership and partnership. I want to thank our Senate colleagues for doing their part. I want to thank the staff that worked so hard on this bill. We should be seizing every available opportunity to cut off resources to ISIS and other terrorist groups. This legislation goes after a practice that has put millions of dollars in ISIS' hands and has resulted in the irreversible destruction of some of history's greatest artifacts. So it destroys these artifacts, which is bad enough, but then it puts money in ISIS' hands. They actually make money by doing it. It is aiding and abetting terrorism. So it is a double whammy. We knew from past experience that the approach laid out in this bill works. It is long past due that we ramp up our efforts to stop the looting, stop the trafficking, and stop the destruction. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and send it to the President. I know that the President will sign it. It is very important. I hope we will soon see this legislation enacted and on the books. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Again, I thank Mr. Eliot Engel of New York for this legislation. The ancient cities now facing destruction at the hands of ISIS are considered the birthplace of modern civilization. As we stand here on the floor of the House, we see behind us the relief of the great lawgivers. First, there is Moses. Next to him is Hammurabi for Hammurabi's Code, the great lawgivers and heroes of liberty. We think about the fact that, in this part of the world, these antiquities are now in the hands of ISIS. [[Page H1987]] As one expert told the Financial Services Committee's Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing last week, this is where the Acadian King Hammurabi ruled at the beginning of the second millennium BC and where the Hebrew prophet Jonah preached successfully repentance to the Assyrian Ninevites 1,000 years later. Now, in 2015, ISIS has as many as 4,500 cultural sites under its control. A raid carried out last year by U.S. Special Forces revealed that ISIS has invested heavily in the looting and smuggling of antiquities in the region as they cut up antiquities and then try to trade them for hard currency. The legislation before us today is an important step toward curbing this illicit trade and limiting funding to these terrorists. I do want to note that the bill's emergency import restrictions are not designed to continue in perpetuity and can be waived under certain conditions for the temporary safeguarding of cultural property in the United States. The bill also presses the administration to increase accountability for U.S. efforts to protect cultural property overseas and improves congressional oversight of this work. I appreciate the other committees of jurisdiction for working with the Foreign Affairs Committee on this measure, particularly the Committee on Ways and Means for its assistance on the cultural import restrictions in this bill. Lastly, I want to recognize the work of the committee staff on this important legislation, particularly Jessica Kelch, who, along with Mark Iozzi on Mr. Engel's staff and Kristen Marquardt on the Foreign Affairs Committee staff, worked out all the complexities to deliver what I am confident will be effective legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 1493. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,21566,21566,21634,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [house] [pages h1984-h1987] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] protect and preserve international cultural property act mr. royce. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and concur in the senate amendment to the bill (h.r. 1493) to protect and preserve international cultural property at risk due to political instability, armed conflict, or natural or other disasters, and for other purposes. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the senate amendment is as follows: senate amendment: strike out all after the enacting clause and insert: section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``protect and preserve international cultural property act''. sec. 2. sense of congress. it is the sense of congress that the president should establish an interagency coordinating [[page h1985]] committee to coordinate the efforts of the executive branch to protect and preserve international cultural property at risk from political instability, armed conflict, or natural or other disasters. such committee should-- (1) be chaired by a department of state employee of assistant secretary rank or higher, concurrent with that employee's other duties; (2) include representatives of the smithsonian institution and federal agencies with responsibility for the preservation and protection of international cultural property; (3) consult with governmental and nongovernmental organizations, including the united states committee of the blue shield, museums, educational institutions, and research institutions, and participants in the international art and cultural property market on efforts to protect and preserve international cultural property; (4) coordinate core united states interests in-- (a) protecting and preserving international cultural property; (b) preventing and disrupting looting and illegal trade and trafficking in international cultural property, particularly exchanges that provide revenue to terrorist and criminal organizations; (c) protecting sites of cultural and archaeological significance; and (d) providing for the lawful exchange of international cultural property. sec. 3. emergency protection for syrian cultural property.

[[page h1986]] isis claims the annihilation of cultural sites is meant to counter idol worship, but clearly these terrorists have another goal: to remove all traces of the region's rich and diverse religious and cultural past. it is in line with what the nazis tried to do in burning the books across europe in trying to burn history that predated them. by eliminating all evidence of religious pluralism and by eliminating all evidence of humanity's common heritage, it is paving the way for its own horrifying brand of radical islamist extremism. the looting of antiquities is big business for isis. experts estimate that the group has earned millions of dollars from the sale of stolen artifacts every year, which are often peddled by middlemen in old- fashioned markets or online. unfortunately, buyers in the u.s. appear to be a primary end destination for many of these pieces, as does europe, as does asia. mr. speaker, i just returned from the middle east. i was honored to speak at the iraq museum in baghdad about the need to counter isis' trafficking of priceless antiquities. this region is steeped in history from the rise and fall of empires to the evolution of writing and mathematics and art. much of this heritage remains at risk due to looting by isis and, i should add, by other parties to the conflict in syria, including the murderous assad regime. that is why last year, ranking member eliot engel and i introduced this legislation, which will help the u.s. do its part to counter this black market trade. specifically, this legislation will prevent those antiquities that have been removed since the start of syria's civil war from being sold or imported into the united states. this will reduce funding to isis and will disincentivize future looting. again, i thank the ranking member, as well as representatives smith and keating, for all of their work on this measure. i also acknowledge the bill's senate cosponsors--senators casey and perdue and grassley, as well as chairman corker and ranking member cardin of the senate committee on foreign relations--whose leadership was instrumental to this measure's passage by mr. engel in the senate. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in strong support of this legislation. first of all, i thank our chairman, ed royce, for his leadership on the committee on foreign affairs and for pushing this bill ahead. i don't want to underestimate how important he has been in making sure that this bill reaches the floor. i thank congressman chris smith for joining me as a lead republican cosponsor on this measure, and i thank our senate colleagues for their work to help get us to this point. this legislation is another great example of the committee on foreign affairs' working across the aisle to get results because we believe, again, that foreign policy should be bipartisan and that partisanship should stop at the water's edge. when the house finishes its work on this bill today, it will be on its way to the president's desk, and that is something of which we should all be proud. mr. speaker, since the time isis emerged as a factor in iraq and in syria, we have read reports, have seen images, and have watched videos of isis terrorists in their destroying of ancient structures and artifacts in the areas they control. it is actually heartbreaking. these fanatics literally want to wipe away history. they want to destroy any trace of culture or belief system that doesn't conform to their twisted ideology and twisted way of thinking, but that is not the whole story. isis has also seized on cultural artifacts as a funding source. if you look at satellite pictures of heritage sites that isis controls, you can pick out thousands of small holes in the desert. isis has looted these areas, has dug up coins and statues and anything else it can carry, and has trafficked those items on the black market. as a result, millions of dollars have flowed into isis' coffers. so a few years ago i knew we needed to do more to combat this serious problem. with the help of several colleagues--and, again, i emphasize how helpful the chairman has been--i set out to help preserve this history and, at the same time, to cut off a vital revenue stream for these terrorists. i was confident we could do it because we have done it before. during the iraq war, we also saw the looting of antiquities. so we passed legislation then to impose import restrictions on those items coming in from iraq. {time} 1816 i decided that we needed to take similar steps with respect to items coming out of syria. so we got to work, talking to experts and officials to find the best ways of stopping looted goods arriving on our shores and to make sure those goods aren't sold to help isis' campaign of violence. it is really disgraceful that anyone in the united states would buy these things. those proven practices and innovative approaches are at the core of this bill. these restrictions would bring the united states in line with the u.n. security council resolution passed unanimously last year. that resolution called on all states to deny funding to isis by preventing trade in iraqi and syrian cultural property. our european partners have already stepped up and enacted similar measures. that is good news because it is going to take a wide-ranging effort to effectively crack down on this illegal marketplace. my bill would also encourage administration agencies already working on this problem to collaborate more closely so that our efforts are more streamlined and efficient. finally, it is important to note that the legislation would not prevent the importation of syrian artifacts for preservation or restoration. so this is a good bill. i have been working on it for several years. i am proud of everything that has gone into it by my colleagues and our staff members. i am glad, once again, that we are working in a bipartisan way to pass legislation that advances our interests, and i am very grateful that we are so close to the finish line on this bill. so i want to thank everybody. i want to especially thank chairman royce once again. i ask that all members support this bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time to close. mr. engel. mr. speaker, it is always a great feeling to cross the finish line on a piece of legislation. at our best, that is what the foreign affairs committee does, and we are at our best here this day. so i again want to thank chairman royce for his leadership and partnership. i want to thank our senate colleagues for doing their part. i want to thank the staff that worked so hard on this bill. we should be seizing every available opportunity to cut off resources to isis and other terrorist groups. this legislation goes after a practice that has put millions of dollars in isis'

Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, for the last 2 years, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) and I have had the honor of co- chairing the Congressional Charity Golf Classic with Members and former Members. This year, the tournament was a great success. We had over 200 participants, counting Members, former Members, military, and volunteers. The charity chosen by the United States Association of Former Members of Congress for the past 9 years has been Warfighter Sports, which is an organization that enables our most severely wounded military people--those who have lost legs or arms or who have been blinded--to participate in sports. This year, we were able to raise $137,000 for that great charity. The Republicans won the Speaker's Trophy, which I have here, by a score of 158-109. The number one team was headed by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), and the number two team was headed by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Crenshaw). I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green), the co- chairman. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to co-chair the Congressional Charity Golf Classic. The real winners of this golf tournament are the wounded warriors we golfed with. Over the last number of years, since we have changed the format, we have been able to see the changes in them. There is a competitiveness between Republicans and Democrats, but we also play with a lot of people who have literally put their life on the line for our country. They have illnesses and disabilities that this program benefits. I want to thank my colleague from Tennessee. Coming from Texas, I will quit saying the best thing from Tennessee came out in 1836. It was a lot of fun, and I thank the gentleman for doing this. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Page H1988] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NINTH ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL CHARITY GOLF CLASSIC (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, in Houston, Harris County, and surrounding counties last week, eight of our fellow citizens lost their lives. I want to offer our thoughts and prayers on behalf of the families of German Antonio Franco, Claudia Melgar, Sunita Vikas, Malhara Singh, Pedro Rascon Morales, Charles Edward Odum, Suresh Kumar Talluri, and Teri White Rodriguez. They are all loving members of families, who now have lost their lives, and the families are saddened by their loss. In the course of this, I want to thank the first responders for their courageous efforts in, one, seeking to find these individuals, and also helping those who have been impacted by the flooding. The efforts of Houstonians who came to the aid of neighbors and strangers during the flooding saved more lives and provided comfort to those impacted. We offer a special thanks to the diverse religious communities that responded with generosity, by feeding and helping thousands of households left homeless. We are also very grateful for the presence and laudable work of the American Red Cross and, as well, the City of Houston and Harris County, the mayor and county judge, all who were participating in this effort along with other elected officials. When tragedy strikes, we come together, congressional persons, State persons, local elected officials, because we are Texans. It was very sad to lose this many people in a storm that was unexpected. In Ecclesiastes Chapter 3: ``To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven . . . a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.'' I would ask, as we begin to try and rebuild our lives, that we have a moment of silence; if my colleagues would stand in a moment of silence for those names that I have called: German Antonio Franco, Claudia Melgar, Sunita Vikas, Malhara Singh, Pedro Rascon Morales, Charles Edward Odum, Suresh Kumar Talluri, and Teri White Rodriguez. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of my colleagues in the Texas Congressional Delegation in remembrance of those who lost their lives during the Flooding tragedy that occurred in the city of Houston and the surrounding area.

Teri White Rodriguez I thank all of the first responders for their courageous and effective efforts to bring assistance and support to those impacted by the flooding last week. The efforts of Houstonians who came to the aid of neighbors and strangers during the flooding saved lives and provided comfort to those impacted. We offer a special thanks to the diverse religious community of Houston who responded with generosity and compassion to over 1000 households left homeless by the flooding. We are also very grateful for the presence and laudable work of the American Red Cross whose volunteers some of which were also victims of the flooding immediately began to offer aid and assistance to flood victims. As elected officials we share a common bond with our constituents that motivate our work on their behalf each day. When tragedy strikes we in the Texas Delegation cease to see the victims as being from a city, town or rural community but as Texans who are in trouble or in need of help. Ecclesiastics Chapter 3: To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven . . . A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance. This past week has been a time of weeping for far too many Houstonians and those impacted in the State of Texas by flooding, which caused more than $5 billion in damage and loss of life. Today the House stands as one to express our condolences to those impacted by the flooding and to show our commitment that we will do all that we can to ease the suffering of those affected and work to minimize the damage caused by flooding in our State of Texas and every other state.

This past Sunday, in my home State of Rhode Island, the Autism Project held its 14th Annual Imagine Walk and Family Fun Day. Each year, this event keeps getting bigger and bigger, both because the awareness continues to grow, but also because autism continues to grow as a challenge. Thanks to the executive director, Joanne Quinn, and the entire team of the Autism Project, thousands of Rhode Islanders joined together for a fun-filled day to increase awareness of autism spectrum disorder. Every year, they inspire me to fight for programs and resources that will lead to a better future for families living with autism, and I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in this fight by supporting Autism Awareness not just in April, but every month of the year. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Page H1990] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

To address this, Carolyn creatively wove technology into library resources to increase accessibility for both students and teachers. Now, students and teachers are able to access library material at any time online, which, in turn, has increased their potential in the classroom.

[[page h1991]] mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, while horrific trench warfare was taking place in europe, half a continent away on april 25, 1915, the australian and new zealand army corps, anzac, set out to capture the dardanelles and gallipoli, but met fierce resistance from the ottoman turks. it was world war i, 100 years ago. what was originally intended to quickly eliminate turkey from the war turned into a bloody, 8-month battle. more than 8,000 australians and 2,400 new zealanders died in that campaign. the battle and the losses of so many caused australians and new zealanders to remember the sacrifice of all those who died on anzac day, a day of remembrance, april 25. the australians have built a magnificent memorial to their war dead. having seen it, i was humbly inspired how australians show gratitude to their fallen warriors. mr. speaker, join me in honoring our friends and allies, the aussies and the kiwis across the sea, as they honor their fallen on anzac day, those who died in the war to end all wars. and that is just the way it is. ____________________",1370

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight for two purposes. The first is to warmly recognize my noble brother, Steve. I am so proud of you. The second reason I rise is as co-chair of the Ukrainian Caucus to commemorate one of the greatest engineering and political tragedies in modern history. Thirty years ago today, on April 26, 1986, at 1:23 a.m., operators in the control room of reactor number 4 mishandled a routine safety test at Chernobyl's Vladimir Illyich Lenin Nuclear Power Station in the former Soviet Union, now present-day Ukraine. The mishandled test led to a catastrophic explosion that burned for 10 days, and the radioactive fallout spread over tens of thousands of square miles forcing more than one-quarter of a million people permanently from their homes. Its plumes reached northern Europe as well. Chernobyl's legacy remains a heavy burden for the people of Ukraine. To its everlasting shame, the Soviet Union tried to cover up the severity of the disaster engulfing the region with repercussions that could have been avoided. The event drove one-third of a million people from their homes and triggered an epidemic level of thyroid cancer. Over the years, the economic losses have amounted to hundreds of billions of dollars. Mr. Speaker, the impact of Chernobyl lingers socially, economically, and culturally. We, as a free world, should help build a bright future for these communities and their people who persevered in the face of such profound catastrophe. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [House] [Page H1991] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING CHERNOBYL (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, from our Nation's farmers to our foresters, anglers, hunters, and those who love the outdoors, good land management and conservation practices hold endless benefits. To support this stewardship, the 2014 farm bill provides substantial opportunities for agricultural conservation. This includes initiatives such as the Conservation Reserve Program, Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and Conservation Stewardship Program, just to name a few. These voluntary programs are essential in assisting landowners to implement best management practices while also improving water quality and the surrounding watersheds. The farm bill and the committee have also worked to promote well- managed forests. Our Nation's forests, of course, are economic engines in many rural areas while providing resources for our Nation. Additionally, our forests also deliver significant ecological benefits because they are natural water filters, as well as our most important carbon sinks. With Earth Day last Friday, I think it is timely to recognize all the great conservation work going on in our communities and in our committee, and the importance of managed land and water.

That certainly is what we have seen this appropriations season. The Appropriations Committee has already held dozens of hearings. It has marked up funding bills at a steady clip. It is sending good legislation to the floor. One of those bills is the energy security and water infrastructure appropriations measure which is before us now. This legislation is important for American energy, for American waterways and ports, and for American commerce and safety. It will also maintain our nuclear deterrence posture by ensuring nuclear stockpile readiness, which is important for national security. I would like to recognize the bill managers for their diligent work to bring this legislation to the floor for consideration. I would also like to recognize the leadership of the Appropriations Committee for its work in getting this process moving. By returning to regular order, we have opened up the process and empowered Senators--both those who sit on the Appropriations Committee and those who do not--to have more of a say in the appropriations legislation.

Mr. President, I want to be clear about something else, something that is vitally important, something that is imperative. The Senate must do something now to address the outbreak of the Zika virus. We are not going to interfere with the Energy and Water appropriations bill, but we must do something to confront this scourge that is facing our country and the western part of the world. [[Page S2426]] Anyone who has followed the news over the past few months has undoubtedly heard about the spread of Zika. Zika is a virus spread by mosquitos in warmer tropical areas. We have warmer areas in the United States--not tropical but warm--and they breed mosquitos. Zika has been linked to many health problems, but most notable is a terrible birth defect called microencephaly. We have all seen pictures of these babies with these small heads, caused by a mosquito bite. Dr. Anthony Fauci from the National Institutes of Health--he is the leader of the institute dealing with infectious disease--came to the Capitol last Thursday. He briefed us about this thing called Zika. He described how dangerous it is. He was accompanied by people from the Centers for Disease Control. He is, of course, representing the National Institutes of Health. We also had the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They were here to tell us how serious the situation is, how dangerous it is. There are a number of problems as a result of this virus, but the one that has been most illustrated is the fact that in infants the skull does not fully form. So the skull never completely pushes out to form around the brain. So when they are born, these babies have tiny, undeveloped skulls. Sometimes the skulls collapse. Aside from the damaged brains and skulls, these babies also have, of course, developmental delays. Earlier this year a baby in Hawaii was born with this disease, but, sadly, the worst is on its way. We have seen cases of this virus all over the continental United States. These have been linked to travel or transmitted from someone who has traveled to Zika-affected areas. Most Americans are afraid to travel abroad--and, I am sorry to say, rightfully so--for fear of mosquitos carrying Zika, that Zika will infect them. But Zika is already upon us in Puerto Rico and in Florida, and it is going to spread to other places. These mosquitos can breed in something smaller than a bottle cap of water. Puerto Rico is battling the local transmission of the virus as we speak. As of last Friday, the island already had more than 500 confirmed cases of Zika, and they are concerned that 1 in 5 Puerto Ricans could have been infected. Our fellow American citizens in Puerto Rico have limited funding to fight this growing epidemic. We have heard about the financial problems they are having. The Puerto Rican government doesn't even have enough money to pay contractors to empty the septic tanks in schools, which are breeding grounds for mosquito larvae, capable of producing billions of mosquitos--not millions but billions. Experts tell us it won't be long before the mosquitos carrying Zika are infecting people here in the continental United States. We can't wait for that before we act. This is an emergency situation, if anything ever were. The Senate must do something now to counter the spread of this virus. The White House has taken money--they asked for money 2 months ago, but during that period of time, they took money from Ebola funding, which is also vitally important. We are doing pretty well stopping the spread of that. But taking that money away, we are going to be right back with the problem with Ebola if it is not replaced. We have a bill ready to go. Senator Nelson of Florida, who is going to feel this as much as any Senator in the country, has provided a bill to give the President the money he has asked for: $1.9 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations. Democrats believe this $1.9 billion is a good start. Our Nation's public health and infectious disease experts say this is roughly how much money they need to fight this virus. We would be irresponsible not to provide this money and do it now. Senator Nelson's bill will bolster our defense against Zika by funding the development of vaccines, mosquito control methods, and testing and services to those who are infected. So I say to my Republican colleagues, I say to the Republican leader: Do we want to wait until more babies are born with these permanent disabilities--disabilities caused by a virus that the vaccine could help prevent, if not for all children, then for many? Do we want to wait until people in the United States start to suffer from paralysis caused by Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is also linked to Zika? It has already been more than 2 months since the President requested this emergency funding. The longer we wait, the worse it will be. States are already scrambling to address Zika. A story in the Washington Post highlighted the danger of inaction. I quote: Cities and states preparing for possible Zika outbreaks this spring and summer are losing millions of federal dollars that local officials say they were counting on, not only for on-the-ground efforts to track and contain the spread of the mosquito-borne virus but also to respond to other emergencies that threaten public health. Los Angeles County, for example, says it won't be able to fill 17 vacancies at its public health laboratory or buy equipment to upgrade its capability for Zika testing. Michigan is concerned about providing resources to help Flint contend with its ongoing water-contamination crisis. Minnesota plans to reduce its stockpile of certain medications needed to treat first responders during emergencies. The across-the-board funding cuts are part of a complicated shift of resources that the Obama administration blames on Congress for its refusal to approve the White House's $1.9 billion emergency request to combat Zika. The President is right. He is pointing the finger where it belongs-- right here at Congress. So I implore my Republican colleagues, I implore my friend the Republican leader: Let's act now. We have done the work. We have a bill to provide what experts need to fight this devastating virus. Let's get it done. For more than a week, we have heard about Republicans and the appropriations folks working toward an agreement. I have yet to see it. I have heard about it. If the Republican leader and Appropriations have an alternative, they should bring it to the floor now. Democrats are happy to work toward a solution, but we have to get started. We need to get the experts the resources they need to prevent the spread of Zika. It is not acceptable to do nothing. The Senate should not leave this week without addressing legislation that fights Zika. We cannot go on break without taking care of this emergency. When the Senate finishes the work on Energy and Water, we must move to the Zika legislation. The National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, the entire Health and Human Services Cabinet office--they need Congress to send them the funding necessary to start working on a solution to Zika. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2425-S2426] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ZIKA VIRUS Mr. REID.

Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin said: ``When the well is dry, we know the worth of water.'' The drought is here. It has been going on for 15 to 20 years in the western part of the United States. All over the West, we are perilously close to running dry. The water situation is as dangerous as it has been in our lifetime. The States of California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming don't have these huge rivers like we see west of the Mississippi. We have, basically, the little Colorado River. It is a tiny little river. In the past, it has become mighty, but for very short periods of time. That little river is called upon to respond to everything. One of the things that is happening is that Lake Powell, the largest manmade lake in America, is going dry. There is no end in sight. This drought has dropped Lake Mead, which is the resource for water that goes everyplace in the West. Most of the water in California they get out of the Colorado. It all comes out of Lake Mead. Lake Mead levels have dropped to levels not seen since the Great Depression. That is, of course, when the lake was born. It hasn't been full in over three decades. To make matters worse, El Nino is supposed to ease the pain, but it hasn't--only a little bit more. Some say up to 50 million people rely on the Colorado River. We know the State of California, with almost 40 million people, depends on it as much as any other source of water. We have to work to reverse current trends or face a future where water shortages become the new normal. The Federal Government can and should work with States on solutions that make our precious water supplies more sustainable. We [[Page S2427]] need to work together, as the States of California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and even Wyoming, which is a long way away, have worked to solve the issues. Today the Senate continues deliberation on the Energy and Water bill. Later this morning we will consider three amendments. One is a Reid- Heller amendment, which seeks to address drought conditions throughout the West. Our amendment would build on that spirit of collaboration by trying to address the fact that we need to stretch every drop of water as far as it will go. This legislation isn't for any one city or region. It will help every State that relies upon the water in the Colorado River system: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. I hope this amendment will be adopted. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. President, will the Chair announce the business of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2426-S2427] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDRESSING DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE WEST Mr. REID.

This legislation isn't for any one city or region. It will help every State that relies upon the water in the Colorado River system: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. I hope this amendment will be adopted. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. President, will the Chair announce the business of the day. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,2814,2814,2882,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [senate] [pages s2426-s2427] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] addressing drought conditions in the west mr. reid. mr. president, benjamin franklin said: ``when the well is dry, we know the worth of water.'' the drought is here. it has been going on for 15 to 20 years in the western part of the united states. all over the west, we are perilously close to running dry. the water situation is as dangerous as it has been in our lifetime. the states of california, arizona, nevada, colorado, utah, and wyoming don't have these huge rivers like we see west of the mississippi. we have, basically, the little colorado river. it is a tiny little river. in the past, it has become mighty, but for very short periods of time. that little river is called upon to respond to everything. one of the things that is happening is that lake powell, the largest manmade lake in america, is going dry. there is no end in sight. this drought has dropped lake mead, which is the resource for water that goes everyplace in the west. most of the water in california they get out of the colorado. it all comes out of lake mead. lake mead levels have dropped to levels not seen since the great depression. that is, of course, when the lake was born. it hasn't been full in over three decades. to make matters worse, el nino is supposed to ease the pain, but it hasn't--only a little bit more. some say up to 50 million people rely on the colorado river. we know the state of california, with almost 40 million people, depends on it as much as any other source of water. we have to work to reverse current trends or face a future where water shortages become the new normal. the federal government can and should work with states on solutions that make our precious water supplies more sustainable. we [[page s2427]] need to work together, as the states of california, arizona, nevada, utah, and even wyoming, which is a long way away, have worked to solve the issues. today the senate continues deliberation on the energy and water bill. later this morning we will consider three amendments. one is a reid- heller amendment, which seeks to address drought conditions throughout the west. our amendment would build on that spirit of collaboration by trying to address the fact that we need to stretch every drop of water as far as it will go. this legislation isn't for any one city or region. it will help every state that relies upon the water in the colorado river system: arizona, california, colorado, nevada, new mexico, utah, and wyoming. i hope this amendment will be adopted. i urge my colleagues to support it. mr. president, will the chair announce the business of the day. ____________________",2814

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2028, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Pending: Alexander/Feinstein amendment No. 3801, in the nature of a substitute.

Under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided between the two managers or their designees. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Zika Virus Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, by now we have all seen reports of the neurological damage that is done by the Zika virus. We have seen the damage it can do to newborn infants. It has been clinically linked to serious birth defects in pregnant women who contract it. Since the start of the outbreak, nearly 900 Americans in 41 States, Washington, DC, and 3 U.S. territories--including over 80 pregnant women--have already contracted Zika. In my State of Illinois, 13 people have already tested positive, including at least two pregnant women. But because we have the best scientists and researchers in the world at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we know more today about the virus and prevention measures than we did when most of us first heard the word ``Zika'' a few months ago. We know that mosquitoes spread the disease. We know that the arrival of warm weather signals the start of mosquito season, but America is currently unprepared to deal with an outbreak of this dangerous virus. We must improve vector control. We must expand access to family planning, education, and contraception. We must accelerate efforts to develop a vaccine as quickly as humanly possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention desperately needs funding to deal with this crisis, and they need it now before the summer months, when mosquitoes spread north across the United States. Congress has failed to even consider President Obama's emergency Zika funding request. What on Earth is Congress waiting for? Last week Senate Democrats sent a letter to Senate Republican leadership calling for immediate action to pass the Zika supplemental request. I hope this call for action will be heard by all of my Republican colleagues, but I especially hope that it resonates with my colleagues from the Southern States. These are the States that are the most likely to be hit first and hardest by the Zika mosquito virus: Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, and the list goes on. In the absence of congressional action--immediate congressional action--the administration has been forced to divert funding and resources away from other important public health efforts in order to respond to Zika. This morning's Washington Post headline in a few words tells the story: ``Zika crisis costs states funds for emergency preparedness.'' What does that mean? The President asked for this supplemental request weeks ago. The refusal of the Republican-led Congress to respond to the President's request for emergency public health funds to fight Zika means that we are cutting back on public health preparedness in States all across the Nation. Frankly, we are endangering people whom we represent because the Republican majority in Congress refuses to give the President his supplemental request to deal with the Zika virus. For instance, the administration just had to divert $2 million in public health emergency preparedness grants away from Illinois in order to fight Zika in Southern States. Well, let me tell you, I want to help people everywhere, including those in Southern States who are likely to be hit first, but not at the expense of the public health of the people I represent. There is an answer. President Obama suggests it--an emergency public health supplemental for the Zika virus. The Republican majority in Congress has refused to act. Both the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Chicago Department of Public Health received grants to prepare for and to respond to all kinds of public outbreaks, such as Ebola, Zika, and Elizabethkingia, which I will talk about in a moment. These cuts, which are being proposed in order to have the administration have enough resources to respond, are unacceptable and unexplainable. They come at a time when Illinois, my State, is in the middle of the longest budget crisis in our State's history. This current Governor has been unable to reach an agreement on a budget for almost 11 months, making it difficult for Illinois families and State agencies in ordinary circumstances. But because congressional Republican leaders have failed to pass a Zika emergency public health supplemental requested by President Obama, the administration has had to divert money away from States such as Illinois to respond to the threat of the Zika virus in other States. Is this any way to govern a great Nation? Illinois should not have to lose precious funding to deal with public health threats because Republican congressional leaders--from Southern states, I might add--have refused to pass the necessary additional funding to deal with Zika, a virus that will likely impact their States first and hardest. We have to do both. We should pass the Zika supplemental so Illinois and other States can keep the funding they need to deal with current public health threats and receive additional funding to deal with Zika. Let me talk about why diverting $2 million from my State of Illinois to Southern States for Zika is a challenge. Last week the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 10 cases of a bacterial infection known as Elizabethkingia. It has resulted in six deaths in my State. This bacterial outbreak is separate from an outbreak in Wisconsin that resulted in over 60 cases of this infection. So in the middle of this outbreak, Illinois is losing 8 percent in core funding for public health contingencies because of the failure of Republican leaders in Congress to pass President Obama's emergency public health supplemental appropriation. [[Page S2428]] This means that the Illinois State Department of health is not going to be as prepared as it should be to conduct the needed epidemiology, laboratory testing, and outbreak control. And four of our health experts say there will be major cuts that hurt our ability to respond to public health crises. What happens tomorrow if there is another outbreak? Last year our State dealt with unexpected serious outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease. Taking money from one State's public health defense effort to give it to another to deal with a public health threat makes no sense in a great nation, particularly when the President showed the appropriate leadership in asking for the $1.9 billion emergency supplemental to deal with the Zika crisis, and the President asked over 2 months ago. I know many Republicans are in denial when it comes to climate change, but if they would have been in Springfield, IL, my home, last Sunday--just 2 days ago--sitting out on the deck in 80-degree weather in April, they might understand warm weather is coming sooner across the United States and with that warm weather, mosquitoes, and with those mosquitoes, the threat of the Zika virus. I don't come to raise an alarm that is unmerited and unwarranted. I believe this is a serious public health challenge, so serious we should not leave Congress this week and take a recess without passing the President's emergency budget supplemental for public health and the Zika virus. The mosquitoes are not going to be on recess next week, they are going to be working, and sadly they are going to be infecting people across the South and across the United States while congressional leaders dither. The supplemental request would provide more than $1.8 billion in emergency funding to improve CDC vector control to control the mosquitoes that threaten us. It would accelerate efforts at the National Institutes of Health to develop a vaccine. I have heard testimony, so I know it takes time to develop a vaccine. Let's do it in an expeditious, safe, thoughtful, and professional way, but let us not shortchange NIH or any other agency that is facing this crisis. We need to expand education. We need to expand access to women's health planning services. The administration provided a comprehensive plan. It cannot be implemented successfully without resources, and we should act on it this week--get it done before we leave. I joined my colleagues Senator Nelson, Leader Reid, Senator Schumer, and Senator Hirono in introducing a bill to fully fund the administration's request. I am pleased to hear my Republican colleagues on the Committee on Appropriations are interested in working with Democrats to reach a deal. I see Senator Alexander on the floor. I know he is sensitive to this, and I hope he will join in calling for leadership on both sides of the Rotunda to move on this issue before we take our recess. Let us not delay this any longer. We need to ensure we aren't diverting necessary Ebola money to be used for the Zika virus. It is naive to believe the Ebola threat is gone and we can ignore the possibility of its reemergence. In my State and others, we know all too well what happens when you divert money from one public health fund to another. This brings to mind the Biblical story of Noah and the great flood. Noah built the arc before the rain, not after it started. It is reckless, it is dangerous to delay. The cases of Zika are continuing to grow, and inaction and further delay put many families, pregnant women, and children in jeopardy. We have seen the Zika threat coming for many months. We have had the President's request for over 2 months. I urge my colleagues this week, before we go home, to take this appropriate action to begin to protect Americans in every State. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, at 11 a.m. we will have three votes on the Merkley, Flake, and Reid amendments. That will bring to a total of 17 the number of amendments we will have disposed of on the floor. Senator Feinstein and I have worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to include many of their policy suggestions and requests in our basic bill. The last count I saw said 77 Members of the Senate had at least part of their requests or policy suggestions in our basic bill. So we are doing very well. Cloture has been filed. There are only a few amendments remaining that are in question. We hope to conclude that quickly and bring the bill to a conclusion. My hope is that when a Senator has a germane amendment, we can have a vote. Sometimes, if they are controversial, they will be at 60. We have done pretty well with that so far--giving Senators a chance to have a say and to have a vote. I would like to spend about 4 or 5 minutes on an amendment we will be voting on at 11, when we will have limited time to talk--unless Senator Feinstein has something she would like to say before I do that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, as I understand it, the filing deadline for first- degree amendments is this afternoon at either 1:30 p.m. or 2:30 p.m. So everybody should get their amendments in. I thank Senator Alexander again for the cooperative spirit with which he is working on this bill. It is very much appreciated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to speak to the amendment from the Senator from Oregon, which would increase the funding for the wind energy program by $15.4 million. This is in addition to the $30 million that our subcommittee has recommended at the request of Senator Gardner of Colorado for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the $50 million Senator Collins of Maine has recommended for offshore wind research. Within the priorities in the bill, we have already put $80 million, and this would add $15 million more. That may not seem like much, but here is my question: I wonder if the American taxpayers wouldn't think that $23 billion is enough to spend on giant windmills--$23 billion. That is the amount the Congressional Research Service has said Congress has spent of taxpayer money to subsidize wealthy people so they can build giant wind turbines across America. That money has been spent from 1992 through 2016 this year. It started out as an effort to help wind turbines get started in 1992, and it has been renewed 10 times. You would think this is a mature industry. In fact, the previous Energy Secretary said it was. What do we get for this $23 billion? Four percent of our electricity is produced by wind turbines in the United States. This is a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world, and we spend $23 billion for 4 percent of our electricity. Thirty-seven percent of all the subsidies, all the spending we have for different forms of energy produces 4 percent of the electricity. The President of the United States and a number of private people in the United States, such as Bill Gates, have announced they would like to double energy research. I support that. The Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and I introduced legislation that would authorize increased funding at the level of 7 percent for energy research this year so we can move more rapidly toward the goal of doubling research for energy. We spend $5 billion a year for energy research for the U.S. Government. We spend nearly $5 billion a year on subsidizing wealthy people so they can build giant wind turbines. We spend as much subsidizing windmills as we spend on all our energy research. If we stop the subsidies, we could double the research, which is what we should be doing. What are we getting for this? We are getting energy--electricity-- that is true, but it mostly blows at night, when we don't need it. It can't be stored for use when we do need it. So it is unreliable. The wind only blows about one-third of the time. In Tennessee it is 18 percent of the time. It can't be stored and we don't need it. We don't need it. At the same time, it destroys the landscape. I am astonished at the environmental groups that would support putting [[Page S2429]] these huge giant turbines in the most beautiful part of our country and then building transmission lines across the country through everybody's backyard. If we replace the 100 nuclear reactors in this country that produce 60 percent of the carbon-free electricity we have--60 percent of the carbon-free electricity--it would take enough windmills to cover a State the size of West Virginia, and I think you would have to have about 17,000 miles, 19,000 miles of new transmission lines. The Presiding Officer is the Senator from Arkansas. In Arkansas, a windmill company is building 700 miles of transmission lines across Arkansas that the State doesn't want and has objected to. Yet the administration is allowing the wind mill company to use Federal preemption for the first time to build transmission lines where people don't want them. Not only is this a wasteful amount of money, not only is it a kind of energy that a country this big cannot rely on, the size of the subsidies create preposterous results. For example, in some cases the subsidy is so large the windmill-producing companies pay the utilities to take their power and they still make a profit. They can pay the utilities to take their power and still make a profit because the taxpayers have spent $23 billion subsidizing wealthy people so they can build windmills. These aren't your grandma's windmills. You can see them for 20 miles away--the flashing lights. They are twice as tall as the football stadium at the University of Tennessee, and only one of these would fit within the football stadium at the University of Tennessee. It would take four nuclear reactors, each taking about 1 square mile, to produce enough electricity to equal the same amount of electricity produced by wind if you strung 45-foot windmill towers along the entire 2,178-mile stretch of the Appalachian Trail. You may say that is a stretch, that will not happen, except that is exactly where the wind towers would be most likely to go--on our scenic mountain tops where more wind blows, and then the transmission lines come down the mountain tops through your backyard. My objection is a very simple one. I think $23 billion is enough to spend on windmills. I have other objections to wind. I think we should focus on nuclear power instead of unreliable wind power. I believe trying to use wind turbines to power a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world is the energy equivalent of going to war in sailboats when the nuclear navy is available, but I certainly think there is no need at all for Senators to say yes to an amendment that spends more money for wind than our subcommittee recommended. We are already spending $23 billion. The taxpayers have been bamboozled into allowing that to happen, and I don't think they would want us to spend more. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Flake amendment No. 3820, which would lower the construction appropriation for the U.S. Corps of Engineers by just under $69 million and eliminate funding for environmental infrastructure projects. Ostensibly, the Corps of Engineers uses these funds to build water supply, water treatment, and wastewater projects. I am not here to argue against the need for environmental infrastructure projects. There are a great many municipalities that consider these projects essential and have made an effort to fund them on their own. That is usually done through a combination of utility bills and municipal bonds. Typically, the users pay for this. However, despite the fact that these projects have traditionally been funded by State and local governments, Federal support is actually duplicative. The Federal Government already offers resources for similar projects through the EPA. Specifically, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund programs provide States with low-interest loans based on the merits of these projects and the needs of the communities. Taxpayers deserve better than to be expected to provide the U.S. Corps of Engineers $69 million it never asked for to fund projects they already support in a program that has been described by many as a slush fund for parochial interests. That is certainly how the program started years ago. Frankly, it has never seemed clear that the Corps of Engineers understands how these projects fit into its mission. Because of a years-old congressional carve-out, these environmental undertakings are not subject to the environmental studies, economic analyses, and cost-effectiveness standards that are required for more traditional Corps projects. As far as I can tell, there is really no rhyme or reason as to how one project gets funding over another. With a national debt of over $19 trillion, it is time that we get a little more serious about putting our fiscal house in order. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and eliminate this duplicative funding. Mr. President, I wish to say a couple words about Reid-Heller amendment No. 3805. I support the Colorado River System Conservation Program. Voluntary efforts like these in Arizona are estimated to have kept Lake Mead at about 3 feet higher than it would have been otherwise. Not coincidentally, last week the Bureau of Reclamation announced that at the end of this year, Lake Mead is predicted to be 3 feet above the level that would trigger a shortage declaration. What I want to make sure happens is that any conserved water actually stays in Lake Mead and keeps these levels up above the shortage declaration area. I note that this amendment simply authorizes funds to go to the conservation program. I hope that before this money is actually spent, we can develop assurances that the water will go to its intended purpose. The Lower Colorado River Basin States have developed such language, and I look forward to ensuring that our Federal dollars are well spent in this area. Amendment No. 3820 to Amendment No. 3801 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3820 and ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the amendment by number. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Flake] proposes an amendment numbered 3820 to amendment No. 3801. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To withhold certain funds for the construction of environmental infrastructure) On page 3, line 11, strike ``$1,813,649,000'' and insert ``$1,744,699,000''. Mr. FLAKE. I yield the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Amendment No. 3812 to Amendment No. 3801 (Purpose: To provide for funding for wind energy) Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3812. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Merkley] proposes an amendment numbered 3812 to amendment No. 3801. On page 23, line 15, strike the period at the end and insert the following: ``: Provided further, That of such amount, $95,400,000 shall be available for wind energy.''. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I wish to add a few remarks about this, as we are preparing shortly to consider a number of amendments. This particular amendment is a bipartisan amendment, which I am pleased to sponsor with my partner from Iowa, stating that wind energy is particularly important. This amendment would restore funding for wind energy research to fiscal year 2016 levels of $95.4 million. Otherwise, research in wind energy would suffer a substantial reduction. This program is indispensable to the success of wind energy in the United States. The wind energy program works to advance innovations in the grid integration, manufacturing, and deployment that are key to reducing the cost of wind energy. For example, the Wind Program helps to address market barriers through including wind-forecasting tools in power system operations, which helps utilities and regulators better integrate large amounts of wind energy into the grid. [[Page S2430]] The Wind Program provides research, development, and technical support to manufacturers and distributors of wind technologies that are still emerging. This enhances small wind manufacturing, supports offshore demonstration projects, and will improve the economic viability of distributed wind. Currently, eight National Laboratories across our Nation conduct research or testing related to wind energy. The proposed fiscal year 2017 funding level is only $80 million, which is over $15 million less than last year's funding--thwarting our ability to realize the true potential for wind energy. During debates, we have sometimes heard that wind is a mature industry and that is why the funding for research should be revoked or lowered. But in fact, as wind is emerging, we are seeing continuous innovations resulting in different designs and different strategies for integrating intermittent wind energy into the grid. As that wind component becomes substantially larger, we need to understand the details of how we accommodate it effectively. If we were to talk about mature industries, then we wouldn't be doing studies for the fossil fuel industry, which is about as mature as an industry can get. Clearly, this is an evolving industry with great potential to assist us with clean energy and, moreover, a program that can affect the economy of rural America. In 2015 wind energy supplied about 5 percent of the total electricity generated in the United States. So it is no longer just a fraction of a percent; it has grown enormously in the last few years. But the Department of Energy estimates that wind could provide as much as 35 percent--or more than one-third--of the electricity generated in our country by the year 2050. As my colleague and partner on this bill, the Senator from Iowa, knows, wind energy can be a huge boon to a State's economy. Iowa is already getting over 30 percent of its electricity from wind. And because wind energy is less expensive in the forecast of potential other sources, it could result in billions of dollars of savings to energy consumers in that State. In my home State of Oregon, we already have over 10 percent of our electricity being generated from wind energy. The savings for our State down the road could be enormous, but we can only reach these goals if we support wind energy research. With the development of wind energy comes hundreds of thousands of jobs in manufacturing, in installation, in maintenance, and in supporting services. The estimate is around 600,000 jobs--generally good-paying jobs--by the year 2015. I do a lot of townhalls back home in Oregon, one in every county every year. Much of Oregon is very rural. I hear about the impact property taxes on these wind installations have on our rural counties, enabling them to do things--for example, to build libraries or assist in the development of their local schools. There is no question that this is a boon to the rural economy. It is our job in Congress to look at what policies will be the most successful and give the most bang for the buck in terms of creating jobs now and in the future. We should be supporting programs that spur economic development and support families in rural areas. That is what this amendment calls for. When we create jobs, local communities benefit, certainly the energy industry benefits, and our environment benefits. All of this depends upon robust research, and we are simply asking that research continue at the same level it did in fiscal year 2016. Let's back red, white, and blue, American-made wind energy and support this bipartisan amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so ordered. There are now 2 minutes equally divided on amendment No. 3812. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we will be voting on amendment No. 3812, which my colleague from Iowa and I have put together to restore research on wind development to the level it was last year. When you see these wind turbines, what you should see is economic development in highly deserving rural communities, putting clean electrons onto the grid, putting jobs into the community, and putting money into the property tax coffers in local communities to do good work. I wish to reserve the rest of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Does the Senator from Tennessee wish to use his time on the amendment? Mr. ALEXANDER. I do, but I will wait until the end. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one uses time, time will be charged equally to both sides. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, can I not reserve the rest of my time? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not at this point. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, don't you think $23 billion is enough to spend on windmills? That is what we have spent since 1992--$23 billion for 4 percent of America's electricity. This is electricity that is unreliable. The windmills blow about one-third of the time, often at night, and it can't be stored. We will spend $5 billion this year and $4.4 billion next year. We could double our energy research spending if we would stop subsidizing wealthy people to build giant wind turbines. Sixty percent of our carbon-free electricity comes from nuclear reactors. Relying on giant wind turbines and new transmission lines to power a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world is like going to war in sailboats when the nuclear Navy is available. We already have $80 million going to research, which Senator Gardner and Senator Collins have asked us to include in the legislation. It is in the bill. We don't need to spend more. We have already spent $23 billion since 1992. Spending $4 or $5 billion a year is more than enough to spend on giant wind turbines. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Merkley amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, these subsidies are a tiny dot compared to the $52 billion spent annually on fossil fuel subsidies and the massive subsidies spent on nuclear. Yet these subsidies are creating jobs in rural America, and that matters. These communities need these jobs. These are clean electrons, these are terrific middle-class jobs, and this is an industry that is still on a curve where research is truly beneficial in making it a success. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey). Mr. DURBIN.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada. Amendment No. 3805 to Amendment No. 3801 Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Reid, I call up the Reid-Heller amendment No. 3805 and ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the amendment by number. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Heller], for Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 3805 to amendment No. 3801. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To make funding for water management improvement subject to a condition) In section 204, strike ``and inserting `$400,000,000' '' and insert ``and inserting `$450,000,000, on the condition that of that amount, $50,000,000 is used to carry out section 206 of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (43 U.S.C. 620 note; Public Law 113- 235)' ''. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada. Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, the Colorado River is the lifeblood of the West. It supplies many of our communities with the majority of its water. The ongoing drought is threatening shortages, reviving the old Mark Twain saying that ``whiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting over.'' In response, the West has teamed up to establish the Colorado River System Conservation Pilot Program, an innovative effort to improve levels in our reservoirs. It is very clear the program is working well. Nineteen agreements have come together, saving 80,000 acre-feet, enough western water for 160,000 households. Increasing our region's water security is essential to Western States. Without water, we cannot grow. I would urge this body to support this extremely important western initiative. I yield the floor. I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this amendment does not increase funding in the bill and the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and I intend to vote for it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman).

Amendment No. 3820 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 3820, offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Flake. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, this amendment would simply cut $69 million in unrequested funding for Corps of Engineers projects. This is kind of the outgrowth of the bad old days when we had earmarks, when all of this funding came about. We now have an earmark ban, but some of the funding still goes to some projects that have not even been requested. If we have a debt of $19 trillion and a deficit of $500 billion, it is time that we actually make some cuts somewhere. I would submit that this is a place ripe for cutting. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am going to oppose the Flake amendment. The Army Corps of Engineers rebuilds locks and dams, dredges our rivers and harbors, works to prevent floods and storm damage, and builds environmental restoration projects. There is not a funding line in the budget that more Senators seek for their States. Our spending is under control on the discretionary side. It is the mandatory spending, the entitlement spending, that is out of control. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also strongly oppose this amendment. This would eliminate funding for our environmental infrastructure projects of the Army Corps of Engineers. Funding for these projects enables communities to solve local problems in a way that protects the environment. Problems are being solved, such as upgrading wastewater treatment facilities, so that our drinking water and marine resources are protected, and replacing deteriorated distribution systems with efficient systems that help conserve water. I hope we will vote this amendment down. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3820. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 307, 357, 358, 359, 362, 363, 364, 459, 460, 461, and 508; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I understand our Democratic friends are going to propound a number of different unanimous consent requests here with regard, I assume, to the judiciary. The core question here is whether President Obama has been treated fairly, and I think it is noteworthy that at this point in President Bush's 8 years, 303 of his judicial nominees had been confirmed. At this point in President Obama's term, the number is 324. That is 21 more judges the current President has gotten at this point than President Bush. Clearly, President Obama has been treated fairly and, therefore, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I am very disappointed the Republicans are blocking dozens of qualified nominees--nominees who have been reported to the Senate floor on a bipartisan basis. This is certainly, in my view, not about whether the President is being treated fairly, but it is about the Senate doing its job. The Senate is on track to confirm the lowest number of judicial nominees in our history. Let me mention a nominee from Hawaii: Clare Connors. She was confirmed or voted on unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last month, a statement to her qualifications. Her wide-ranging experience includes district and appellate venues, criminal and civil arenas, and litigation on issues ranging from tax law to tough cases such as crimes against children. Clare and the other nominees before us today will be kept from serving on the Federal bench because of Republican inaction. My Republican colleagues intend to stop all judicial nominations in July, although there are 79 vacancies pending, 28 of which are considered emergencies. If Ms. Connors is not confirmed, the Hawaii district court seat will be left vacant for over a year. Our judiciary should be composed of the full complement of judges accorded to each district court. One of the fundamental jobs of the Senate to engage in is its advice and consent function with regard to these judicial nominees, and we are not doing that. I call upon my colleagues, my Republican friends, to enable all of us to do our jobs and begin again the advice and consent process which we are, under the Constitution, required to do. I see some other colleagues on the floor, so I yield to my good friend from New York. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York. Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will have a unanimous consent request after I make a few brief remarks. I thank my friends, the Senators from Hawaii and Maryland, for joining me here today. We all know it is the job of the Senate to keep up with the need to confirm judges, but our friends on the other side of the aisle aren't holding up their end of the bargain. The judicial confirmation process has been at a crawl for years. Now it has come to a functional standstill, as noncontroversial nominations--some of which were approved out of committee by overwhelming votes, the majority of Republicans and the majority of Democrats--languish on the Executive Calendar. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle did their best to slow the pace of confirmations when the Senate was under Democratic leadership, and now they are sluggishly moving nominations under a Senate they control. That has culminated in an irresponsible partisan blockade of President Obama's Supreme Court pick. Let's talk about some real numbers. More than 1 year into this new Congress, the Republican leadership has allowed only 17 judges to be confirmed. How many months do we have here? We had 12 in the last year of this Congress, and we are now at the end of April, so that is 4. So that is 16--1 a month. Let me show the contrast. I say to my dear friend, our majority leader, this is the number that counts because the analogy was the last 2 years of the Bush administration when there was a Democratic majority. Then, a Republican President and a Democratic majority; now, a Democratic President and a Republican majority. They confirmed 17 and we confirmed 68. This has consequences--real consequences. The number of vacancies has risen from 43 to 79 since the Republicans took over the majority. That didn't happen when President Bush was President and made nominations. Twenty-eight judicial emergencies. For people seeking justice--they can't get it very speedily because of the obstruction of judges. There are 20 noncontroversial judges on the Executive Calendar. We are urging our colleagues to let these noncontroversial judges go through. Very simply, we are urging our colleagues to do their job. I know the leader wants to have the Senate move along, and we have tried to go along whenever it is possible. But this is a glaring example where it is easy to do your job, where it is easy to move things forward, and all we face is obstruction and for no voiced reason. I would like to know why the judges who I will ask for unanimous consent--it is a smaller list than my colleague from Hawaii has asked to go forward with. I would love to know a single reason why any of them shouldn't be sitting on the bench. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 307, 357, 358, 359, 362, and 363; further, that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations; that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would say to my Democratic friends that no effort to redefine what this is about will be successful. The issue before the Senate is, has President Obama been treated fairly with regard to the confirmation of judges during his tenure in office? We are to a point where we know that so far during the Obama years, he has gotten 23 more judges than President Bush got to this point. That is the fundamental question. Has President Obama been treated in some way differently from President Bush? The answer, of course, is no. Therefore, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Maryland. Unanimous Consent Requests--Executive Calendar Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I will continue to try here, and I thank the Senate majority leader for his patience. This is really not a matter of fairness to the President but fairness to the [[Page S2433]] American people. As my colleague Senator Hirono pointed out, this is a matter of justice delayed is justice denied. We have judicial emergencies--many on our list--that have not been filled. As Senator Schumer pointed out, this is about comparing what has been done on the workload of this Congress to any previous Congress on the confirmation of judges, and we are dead last as far as action that has been taken. I think the critical number is the number of vacancies. Compare the number of vacancies. When the Republicans took the majority, there were 43 vacancies in our courts. That number has almost doubled to 79 vacancies. When we take a look at the pace of confirmation--because we could say maybe there were a lot that had to be taken up over a President's term. But, as Senator Schumer pointed out, there have been only 17 judges confirmed to date. That is one of the lowest numbers in the modern history of our country. In the last year of President Bush's administration, in the same period of time of that 2-year cycle, 68 judges had been confirmed by a Democratically controlled Senate. What makes matters more difficult for the American people to understand is that 20 judicial nominations have currently passed the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe every one has been passed by unanimous voice vote, so they are not controversial. It is just a matter of getting them up for confirmation--20 of them that have yet to be acted on the floor of the Senate. I will make two unanimous consent requests that will deal with 4 of these 20 currently pending. All passed the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice votes. Two are from States that have Democratic Senators and two are from States that have Republican Senators. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar No. 307, Xinis of Maryland; Calendar No. 357, Martinotti of New Jersey; Calendar No. 358, Rossiter of Nebraska; and Calendar No. 359, Stanton of Tennessee; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for the reasons previously expressed by the majority leader, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to make one further request in the series with Senator Hirono and Senator Schumer, and that is to deal with the next nominee who would be up, considering the length of time she has been on the calendar. It is the nomination of Paula Xinis of Maryland made in March 2015--over 1 year ago--by President Obama. She was recommended by Senator Mikulski and me after an exhaustive vetting process that we go through before making recommendations to the President of the United States. She was nominated over 1 year ago. She had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee in July of 2015. As I said earlier, she was reported out of the committee by unanimous voice vote in September of last year, and she has been waiting all this time for action on the Senate floor. We need this vacancy filled. We now have two vacancies in the Maryland District. The chief judge has related to us several times that this position is critical for the administration of justice for the people of Maryland and our Nation. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 307, Xinis of Maryland; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nomination; that any related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for reasons previously given, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to inject a few comments in this discussion too. This isn't all about Republicans. This isn't all about Democrats. I had a nominee from Wyoming. Incidentally, he wasn't nominated by me; he was nominated by our Democratic Governor. It took me about 9 months to get a hearing in committee. This was for a district judge. This wasn't for the Supreme Court. This wasn't for a circuit court. This was for a district court. It took me about 9 months to get a hearing for him. At the end of 2 years, he had not gotten a vote in committee. His life was in suspense for 2 years. That is not right. Neither party should do that. But as long as the other side is saying that we are holding things up, I have to point out that it is not just a one-sided thing. I hope some of the criticism can end and some of the work can be done. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I just want to share in the frustration of my colleague from Wyoming. This should not be a partisan issue. I agree, it is wrong to hold people's lives in abeyance. We are trying to get the very best people to serve on our courts. If they have to put their lives on hold for a year or two, will they come forward and seek to serve as a judge? We know that for the ones we are trying to get on the bench, it is going to be a financial sacrifice. They can make more money in the private sector. We want the very best on our courts. If someone is put on hold for 2 years or for 1 year, it compromises their ability if they are in the private practice of law, and it is not the right thing to do--whether it is a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. We have to act on these appointments a lot faster. The point I raised is that during this term of Congress, during this year and a half, we have seen the number of judicial vacancies go up from 43 to 79. At this particular moment, there are 20 nominees on the Executive Calendar who have cleared the committee by voice vote and who are not controversial. Some have been waiting over a year since their nomination. We can do something about it right now, and we should do something about it right now. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I wish to say a few more things regarding our request for action on these judicial nominations. The group of nominations on which I requested action includes nominees from Maryland, New Jersey, Nebraska, Tennessee, New York, California, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Hawaii. They are all waiting. I have just one comment about the Supreme Court vacancy. The last time the Senate refused to deal with a Supreme Court vacancy was during the Civil War. They so objected to dealing with the President's nomination that the Congress actually changed the number of Justices on the Supreme Court. The number of Justices is set by law, so the Congress changed the law and changed the number of Justices from 10 to 7 so that they would not have to deal with the President's nominee to the Supreme Court vacancy. The President vetoed that bill, the Congress overrode that veto, and so they changed the makeup and number of Justices on the Supreme Court. Certainly that is not what I am suggesting Republicans should do. In fact, we have had a nine-member Supreme Court for almost 150 years. I agree with my friend, the Senator from Wyoming, that this should not be a partisan issue. Certainly, I agree with my friend from Maryland that we should get on with it. We should get on with these judicial nominations. We should do our advice and consent role, and clearly with regard to the Supreme Court vacancy, where, with this inaction, we are going to leave that Court [[Page S2434]] with eight members for a year. That is not acceptable to the people of our country. We need to do our job. I ask my Senate colleagues, my Republican friends, to enable the Senate to do our advice and consent role and do our job as set forth in the U.S. Constitution. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2427-S2434] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2028, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Pending: Alexander/Feinstein amendment No. 3801, in the nature of a substitute. Alexander amendment No. 3804 (to amendment No. 3801), to modify provisions relating to Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided between the two managers or their designees. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Zika Virus Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, by now we have all seen reports of the neurological damage that is done by the Zika virus. We have seen the damage it can do to newborn infants. It has been clinically linked to serious birth defects in pregnant women who contract it. Since the start of the outbreak, nearly 900 Americans in 41 States, Washington, DC, and 3 U.S. territories--including over 80 pregnant women--have already contracted Zika. In my State of Illinois, 13 people have already tested positive, including at least two pregnant women. But because we have the best scientists and researchers in the world at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we know more today about the virus and prevention measures than we did when most of us first heard the word ``Zika'' a few months ago. We know that mosquitoes spread the disease. We know that the arrival of warm weather signals the start of mosquito season, but America is currently unprepared to deal with an outbreak of this dangerous virus. We must improve vector control. We must expand access to family planning, education, and contraception. We must accelerate efforts to develop a vaccine as quickly as humanly possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention desperately needs funding to deal with this crisis, and they need it now before the summer months, when mosquitoes spread north across the United States. Congress has failed to even consider President Obama's emergency Zika funding request. What on Earth is Congress waiting for? Last week Senate Democrats sent a letter to Senate Republican leadership calling for immediate action to pass the Zika supplemental request. I hope this call for action will be heard by all of my Republican colleagues, but I especially hope that it resonates with my colleagues from the Southern States. These are the States that are the most likely to be hit first and hardest by the Zika mosquito virus: Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, and the list goes on. In the absence of congressional action--immediate congressional action--the administration has been forced to divert funding and resources away from other important public health efforts in order to respond to Zika. This morning's Washington Post headline in a few words tells the story: ``Zika crisis costs states funds for emergency preparedness.'' What does that mean? The President asked for this supplemental request weeks ago. The refusal of the Republican-led Congress to respond to the President's request for emergency public health funds to fight Zika means that we are cutting back on public health preparedness in States all across the Nation. Frankly, we are endangering people whom we represent because the Republican majority in Congress refuses to give the President his supplemental request to deal with the Zika virus. For instance, the administration just had to divert $2 million in public health emergency preparedness grants away from Illinois in order to fight Zika in Southern States. Well, let me tell you, I want to help people everywhere, including those in Southern States who are likely to be hit first, but not at the expense of the public health of the people I represent. There is an answer. President Obama suggests it--an emergency public health supplemental for the Zika virus. The Republican majority in Congress has refused to act. Both the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Chicago Department of Public Health received grants to prepare for and to respond to all kinds of public outbreaks, such as Ebola, Zika, and Elizabethkingia, which I will talk about in a moment. These cuts, which are being proposed in order to have the administration have enough resources to respond, are unacceptable and unexplainable. They come at a time when Illinois, my State, is in the middle of the longest budget crisis in our State's history. This current Governor has been unable to reach an agreement on a budget for almost 11 months, making it difficult for Illinois families and State agencies in ordinary circumstances. But because congressional Republican leaders have failed to pass a Zika emergency public health supplemental requested by President Obama, the administration has had to divert money away from States such as Illinois to respond to the threat of the Zika virus in other States. Is this any way to govern a great Nation? Illinois should not have to lose precious funding to deal with public health threats because Republican congressional leaders--from Southern states, I might add--have refused to pass the necessary additional funding to deal with Zika, a virus that will likely impact their States first and hardest. We have to do both. We should pass the Zika supplemental so Illinois and other States can keep the funding they need to deal with current public health threats and receive additional funding to deal with Zika. Let me talk about why diverting $2 million from my State of Illinois to Southern States for Zika is a challenge. Last week the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 10 cases of a bacterial infection known as Elizabethkingia. It has resulted in six deaths in my State. This bacterial outbreak is separate from an outbreak in Wisconsin that resulted in over 60 cases of this infection. So in the middle of this outbreak, Illinois is losing 8 percent in core funding for public health contingencies because of the failure of Republican leaders in Congress to pass President Obama's emergency public health supplemental appropriation. [[Page S2428]] This means that the Illinois State Department of health is not going to be as prepared as it should be to conduct the needed epidemiology, laboratory testing, and outbreak control. And four of our health experts say there will be major cuts that hurt our ability to respond to public health crises. What happens tomorrow if there is another outbreak? Last year our State dealt with unexpected serious outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease. Taking money from one State's public health defense effort to give it to another to deal with a public health threat makes no sense in a great nation, particularly when the President showed the appropriate leadership in asking for the $1.9 billion emergency supplemental to deal with the Zika crisis, and the President asked over 2 months ago. I know many Republicans are in denial when it comes to climate change, but if they would have been in Springfield, IL, my home, last Sunday--just 2 days ago--sitting out on the deck in 80-degree weather in April, they might understand warm weather is coming sooner across the United States and with that warm weather, mosquitoes, and with those mosquitoes, the threat of the Zika virus. I don't come to raise an alarm that is unmerited and unwarranted. I believe this is a serious public health challenge, so serious we should not leave Congress this week and take a recess without passing the President's emergency budget supplemental for public health and the Zika virus. The mosquitoes are not going to be on recess next week, they are going to be working, and sadly they are going to be infecting people across the South and across the United States while congressional leaders dither. The supplemental request would provide more than $1.8 billion in emergency funding to improve CDC vector control to control the mosquitoes that threaten us. It would accelerate efforts at the National Institutes of Health to develop a vaccine. I have heard testimony, so I know it takes time to develop a vaccine. Let's do it in an expeditious, safe, thoughtful, and professional way, but let us not shortchange NIH or any other agency that is facing this crisis. We need to expand education. We need to expand access to women's health planning services. The administration provided a comprehensive plan. It cannot be implemented successfully without resources, and we should act on it this week--get it done before we leave. I joined my colleagues Senator Nelson, Leader Reid, Senator Schumer, and Senator Hirono in introducing a bill to fully fund the administration's request. I am pleased to hear my Republican colleagues on the Committee on Appropriations are interested in working with Democrats to reach a deal. I see Senator Alexander on the floor. I know he is sensitive to this, and I hope he will join in calling for leadership on both sides of the Rotunda to move on this issue before we take our recess. Let us not delay this any longer. We need to ensure we aren't diverting necessary Ebola money to be used for the Zika virus. It is naive to believe the Ebola threat is gone and we can ignore the possibility of its reemergence. In my State and others, we know all too well what happens when you divert money from one public health fund to another. This brings to mind the Biblical story of Noah and the great flood. Noah built the arc before the rain, not after it started. It is reckless, it is dangerous to delay. The cases of Zika are continuing to grow, and inaction and further delay put many families, pregnant women, and children in jeopardy. We have seen the Zika threat coming for many months. We have had the President's request for over 2 months. I urge my colleagues this week, before we go home, to take this appropriate action to begin to protect Americans in every State. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, at 11 a.m. we will have three votes on the Merkley, Flake, and Reid amendments. That will bring to a total of 17 the number of amendments we will have disposed of on the floor. Senator Feinstein and I have worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to include many of their policy suggestions and requests in our basic bill. The last count I saw said 77 Members of the Senate had at least part of their requests or policy suggestions in our basic bill. So we are doing very well. Cloture has been filed. There are only a few amendments remaining that are in question. We hope to conclude that quickly and bring the bill to a conclusion. My hope is that when a Senator has a germane amendment, we can have a vote. Sometimes, if they are controversial, they will be at 60. We have done pretty well with that so far--giving Senators a chance to have a say and to have a vote. I would like to spend about 4 or 5 minutes on an amendment we will be voting on at 11, when we will have limited time to talk--unless Senator Feinstein has something she would like to say before I do that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, as I understand it, the filing deadline for first- degree amendments is this afternoon at either 1:30 p.m. or 2:30 p.m. So everybody should get their amendments in. I thank Senator Alexander again for the cooperative spirit with which he is working on this bill. It is very much appreciated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to speak to the amendment from the Senator from Oregon, which would increase the funding for the wind energy program by $15.4 million. This is in addition to the $30 million that our subcommittee has recommended at the request of Senator Gardner of Colorado for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the $50 million Senator Collins of Maine has recommended for offshore wind research. Within the priorities in the bill, we have already put $80 million, and this would add $15 million more. That may not seem like much, but here is my question: I wonder if the American taxpayers wouldn't think that $23 billion is enough to spend on giant windmills--$23 billion. That is the amount the Congressional Research Service has said Congress has spent of taxpayer money to subsidize wealthy people so they can build giant wind turbines across America. That money has been spent from 1992 through 2016 this year. It started out as an effort to help wind turbines get started in 1992, and it has been renewed 10 times. You would think this is a mature industry. In fact, the previous Energy Secretary said it was. What do we get for this $23 billion? Four percent of our electricity is produced by wind turbines in the United States. This is a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world, and we spend $23 billion for 4 percent of our electricity. Thirty-seven percent of all the subsidies, all the spending we have for different forms of energy produces 4 percent of the electricity. The President of the United States and a number of private people in the United States, such as Bill Gates, have announced they would like to double energy research. I support that. The Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and I introduced legislation that would authorize increased funding at the level of 7 percent for energy research this year so we can move more rapidly toward the goal of doubling research for energy. We spend $5 billion a year for energy research for the U.S. Government. We spend nearly $5 billion a year on subsidizing wealthy people so they can build giant wind turbines. We spend as much subsidizing windmills as we spend on all our energy research. If we stop the subsidies, we could double the research, which is what we should be doing. What are we getting for this? We are getting energy--electricity-- that is true, but it mostly blows at night, when we don't need it. It can't be stored for use when we do need it. So it is unreliable. The wind only blows about one-third of the time. In Tennessee it is 18 percent of the time. It can't be stored and we don't need it. We don't need it. At the same time, it destroys the landscape. I am astonished at the environmental groups that would support putting [[Page S2429]] these huge giant turbines in the most beautiful part of our country and then building transmission lines across the country through everybody's backyard. If we replace the 100 nuclear reactors in this country that produce 60 percent of the carbon-free electricity we have--60 percent of the carbon-free electricity--it would take enough windmills to cover a State the size of West Virginia, and I think you would have to have about 17,000 miles, 19,000 miles of new transmission lines. The Presiding Officer is the Senator from Arkansas. In Arkansas, a windmill company is building 700 miles of transmission lines across Arkansas that the State doesn't want and has objected to. Yet the administration is allowing the wind mill company to use Federal preemption for the first time to build transmission lines where people don't want them. Not only is this a wasteful amount of money, not only is it a kind of energy that a country this big cannot rely on, the size of the subsidies create preposterous results. For example, in some cases the subsidy is so large the windmill-producing companies pay the utilities to take their power and they still make a profit. They can pay the utilities to take their power and still make a profit because the taxpayers have spent $23 billion subsidizing wealthy people so they can build windmills. These aren't your grandma's windmills. You can see them for 20 miles away--the flashing lights. They are twice as tall as the football stadium at the University of Tennessee, and only one of these would fit within the football stadium at the University of Tennessee. It would take four nuclear reactors, each taking about 1 square mile, to produce enough electricity to equal the same amount of electricity produced by wind if you strung 45-foot windmill towers along the entire 2,178-mile stretch of the Appalachian Trail. You may say that is a stretch, that will not happen, except that is exactly where the wind towers would be most likely to go--on our scenic mountain tops where more wind blows, and then the transmission lines come down the mountain tops through your backyard. My objection is a very simple one. I think $23 billion is enough to spend on windmills. I have other objections to wind. I think we should focus on nuclear power instead of unreliable wind power. I believe trying to use wind turbines to power a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world is the energy equivalent of going to war in sailboats when the nuclear navy is available, but I certainly think there is no need at all for Senators to say yes to an amendment that spends more money for wind than our subcommittee recommended. We are already spending $23 billion. The taxpayers have been bamboozled into allowing that to happen, and I don't think they would want us to spend more. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Flake amendment No. 3820, which would lower the construction appropriation for the U.S. Corps of Engineers by just under $69 million and eliminate funding for environmental infrastructure projects. Ostensibly, the Corps of Engineers uses these funds to build water supply, water treatment, and wastewater projects. I am not here to argue against the need for environmental infrastructure projects. There are a great many municipalities that consider these projects essential and have made an effort to fund them on their own. That is usually done through a combination of utility bills and municipal bonds. Typically, the users pay for this. However, despite the fact that these projects have traditionally been funded by State and local governments, Federal support is actually duplicative. The Federal Government already offers resources for similar projects through the EPA. Specifically, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund programs provide States with low-interest loans based on the merits of these projects and the needs of the communities. Taxpayers deserve better than to be expected to provide the U.S. Corps of Engineers $69 million it never asked for to fund projects they already support in a program that has been described by many as a slush fund for parochial interests. That is certainly how the program started years ago. Frankly, it has never seemed clear that the Corps of Engineers understands how these projects fit into its mission. Because of a years-old congressional carve-out, these environmental undertakings are not subject to the environmental studies, economic analyses, and cost-effectiveness standards that are required for more traditional Corps projects. As far as I can tell, there is really no rhyme or reason as to how one project gets funding over another. With a national debt of over $19 trillion, it is time that we get a little more serious about putting our fiscal house in order. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and eliminate this duplicative funding. Mr. President, I wish to say a couple words about Reid-Heller amendment No. 3805. I support the Colorado River System Conservation Program. Voluntary efforts like these in Arizona are estimated to have kept Lake Mead at about 3 feet higher than it would have been otherwise. Not coincidentally, last week the Bureau of Reclamation announced that at the end of this year, Lake Mead is predicted to be 3 feet above the level that would trigger a shortage declaration. What I want to make sure happens is that any conserved water actually stays in Lake Mead and keeps these levels up above the shortage declaration area. I note that this amendment simply authorizes funds to go to the conservation program. I hope that before this money is actually spent, we can develop assurances that the water will go to its intended purpose. The Lower Colorado River Basin States have developed such language, and I look forward to ensuring that our Federal dollars are well spent in this area. Amendment No. 3820 to Amendment No. 3801 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3820 and ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the amendment by number. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Flake] proposes an amendment numbered 3820 to amendment No. 3801. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To withhold certain funds for the construction of environmental infrastructure) On page 3, line 11, strike ``$1,813,649,000'' and insert ``$1,744,699,000''. Mr. FLAKE. I yield the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Amendment No. 3812 to Amendment No. 3801 (Purpose: To provide for funding for wind energy) Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3812. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Merkley] proposes an amendment numbered 3812 to amendment No. 3801. On page 23, line 15, strike the period at the end and insert the following: ``: Provided further, That of such amount, $95,400,000 shall be available for wind energy.''. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I wish to add a few remarks about this, as we are preparing shortly to consider a number of amendments. This particular amendment is a bipartisan amendment, which I am pleased to sponsor with my partner from Iowa, stating that wind energy is particularly important. This amendment would restore funding for wind energy research to fiscal year 2016 levels of $95.4 million. Otherwise, research in wind energy would suffer a substantial reduction. This program is indispensable to the success of wind energy in the United States. The wind energy program works to advance innovations in the grid integration, manufacturing, and deployment that are key to reducing the cost of wind energy. For example, the Wind Program helps to address market barriers through including wind-forecasting tools in power system operations, which helps utilities and regulators better integrate large amounts of wind energy into the grid. [[Page S2430]] The Wind Program provides research, development, and technical support to manufacturers and distributors of wind technologies that are still emerging. This enhances small wind manufacturing, supports offshore demonstration projects, and will improve the economic viability of distributed wind. Currently, eight National Laboratories across our Nation conduct research or testing related to wind energy. The proposed fiscal year 2017 funding level is only $80 million, which is over $15 million less than last year's funding--thwarting our ability to realize the true potential for wind energy. During debates, we have sometimes heard that wind is a mature industry and that is why the funding for research should be revoked or lowered. But in fact, as wind is emerging, we are seeing continuous innovations resulting in different designs and different strategies for integrating intermittent wind energy into the grid. As that wind component becomes substantially larger, we need to understand the details of how we accommodate it effectively. If we were to talk about mature industries, then we wouldn't be doing studies for the fossil fuel industry, which is about as mature as an industry can get. Clearly, this is an evolving industry with great potential to assist us with clean energy and, moreover, a program that can affect the economy of rural America. In 2015 wind energy supplied about 5 percent of the total electricity generated in the United States. So it is no longer just a fraction of a percent; it has grown enormously in the last few years. But the Department of Energy estimates that wind could provide as much as 35 percent--or more than one-third--of the electricity generated in our country by the year 2050. As my colleague and partner on this bill, the Senator from Iowa, knows, wind energy can be a huge boon to a State's economy. Iowa is already getting over 30 percent of its electricity from wind. And because wind energy is less expensive in the forecast of potential other sources, it could result in billions of dollars of savings to energy consumers in that State. In my home State of Oregon, we already have over 10 percent of our electricity being generated from wind energy. The savings for our State down the road could be enormous, but we can only reach these goals if we support wind energy research. With the development of wind energy comes hundreds of thousands of jobs in manufacturing, in installation, in maintenance, and in supporting services. The estimate is around 600,000 jobs--generally good-paying jobs--by the year 2015. I do a lot of townhalls back home in Oregon, one in every county every year. Much of Oregon is very rural. I hear about the impact property taxes on these wind installations have on our rural counties, enabling them to do things--for example, to build libraries or assist in the development of their local schools. There is no question that this is a boon to the rural economy. It is our job in Congress to look at what policies will be the most successful and give the most bang for the buck in terms of creating jobs now and in the future. We should be supporting programs that spur economic development and support families in rural areas. That is what this amendment calls for. When we create jobs, local communities benefit, certainly the energy industry benefits, and our environment benefits. All of this depends upon robust research, and we are simply asking that research continue at the same level it did in fiscal year 2016. Let's back red, white, and blue, American-made wind energy and support this bipartisan amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so ordered. There are now 2 minutes equally divided on amendment No. 3812. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we will be voting on amendment No. 3812, which my colleague from Iowa and I have put together to restore research on wind development to the level it was last year. When you see these wind turbines, what you should see is economic development in highly deserving rural communities, putting clean electrons onto the grid, putting jobs into the community, and putting money into the property tax coffers in local communities to do good work. I wish to reserve the rest of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Does the Senator from Tennessee wish to use his time on the amendment? Mr. ALEXANDER. I do, but I will wait until the end. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one uses time, time will be charged equally to both sides. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, can I not reserve the rest of my time? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not at this point. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, don't you think $23 billion is enough to spend on windmills? That is what we have spent since 1992--$23 billion for 4 percent of America's electricity. This is electricity that is unreliable. The windmills blow about one-third of the time, often at night, and it can't be stored. We will spend $5 billion this year and $4.4 billion next year. We could double our energy research spending if we would stop subsidizing wealthy people to build giant wind turbines. Sixty percent of our carbon-free electricity comes from nuclear reactors. Relying on giant wind turbines and new transmission lines to power a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world is like going to war in sailboats when the nuclear Navy is available. We already have $80 million going to research, which Senator Gardner and Senator Collins have asked us to include in the legislation. It is in the bill. We don't need to spend more. We have already spent $23 billion since 1992. Spending $4 or $5 billion a year is more than enough to spend on giant wind turbines. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Merkley amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, these subsidies are a tiny dot compared to the $52 billion spent annually on fossil fuel subsidies and the massive subsidies spent on nuclear. Yet these subsidies are creating jobs in rural America, and that matters. These communities need these jobs. These are clean electrons, these are terrific middle-class jobs, and this is an industry that is still on a curve where research is truly beneficial in making it a success. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 42, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 61 Leg.] YEAS--54 Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Collins Coons Donnelly Durbin Ernst Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Markey McCaskill Menendez Merkley Mikulski Moran Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Portman Reed Reid Rounds Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Thune Udall Warren Whitehouse Wyden [[Page S2431]] NAYS--42 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Coats Cochran Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Enzi Feinstein Fischer Flake Hatch Inhofe Isakson Johnson Lankford Lee Manchin McCain McConnell Murkowski Paul Perdue Risch Roberts Rubio Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Tillis Vitter Wicker NOT VOTING--4 Cruz Sanders Toomey Warner The amendment (No. 3812) was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada. Amendment No. 3805 to Amendment No. 3801 Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Reid, I call up the Reid-Heller amendment No. 3805 and ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the amendment by number. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Heller], for Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 3805 to amendment No. 3801. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To make funding for water management improvement subject to a condition) In section 204, strike ``and inserting `$400,000,000' '' and insert ``and inserting `$450,000,000, on the condition that of that amount, $50,000,000 is used to carry out section 206 of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (43 U.S.C. 620 note; Public Law 113- 235)' ''. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada. Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, the Colorado River is the lifeblood of the West. It supplies many of our communities with the majority of its water. The ongoing drought is threatening shortages, reviving the old Mark Twain saying that ``whiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting over.'' In response, the West has teamed up to establish the Colorado River System Conservation Pilot Program, an innovative effort to improve levels in our reservoirs. It is very clear the program is working well. Nineteen agreements have come together, saving 80,000 acre-feet, enough western water for 160,000 households. Increasing our region's water security is essential to Western States. Without water, we cannot grow. I would urge this body to support this extremely important western initiative. I yield the floor. I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this amendment does not increase funding in the bill and the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and I intend to vote for it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

Amendment No. 3820 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 3820, offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Flake. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, this amendment would simply cut $69 million in unrequested funding for Corps of Engineers projects. This is kind of the outgrowth of the bad old days when we had earmarks, when all of this funding came about. We now have an earmark ban, but some of the funding still goes to some projects that have not even been requested. If we have a debt of $19 trillion and a deficit of $500 billion, it is time that we actually make some cuts somewhere. I would submit that this is a place ripe for cutting. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am going to oppose the Flake amendment. The Army Corps of Engineers rebuilds locks and dams, dredges our rivers and harbors, works to prevent floods and storm damage, and builds environmental restoration projects. There is not a funding line in the budget that more Senators seek for their States. Our spending is under control on the discretionary side. It is the mandatory spending, the entitlement spending, that is out of control. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also strongly oppose this amendment. This would eliminate funding for our environmental infrastructure projects of the Army Corps of Engineers. Funding for these projects enables communities to solve local problems in a way that protects the environment. Problems are being solved, such as upgrading wastewater treatment facilities, so that our drinking water and marine resources are protected, and replacing deteriorated distribution systems with efficient systems that help conserve water. I hope we will vote this amendment down. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3820. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 307, 357, 358, 359, 362, 363, 364, 459, 460, 461, and 508; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I understand our Democratic friends are going to propound a number of different unanimous consent requests here with regard, I assume, to the judiciary. The core question here is whether President Obama has been treated fairly, and I think it is noteworthy that at this point in President Bush's 8 years, 303 of his judicial nominees had been confirmed. At this point in President Obama's term, the number is 324. That is 21 more judges the current President has gotten at this point than President Bush. Clearly, President Obama has been treated fairly and, therefore, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I am very disappointed the Republicans are blocking dozens of qualified nominees--nominees who have been reported to the Senate floor on a bipartisan basis. This is certainly, in my view, not about whether the President is being treated fairly, but it is about the Senate doing its job. The Senate is on track to confirm the lowest number of judicial nominees in our history. Let me mention a nominee from Hawaii: Clare Connors. She was confirmed or voted on unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last month, a statement to her qualifications. Her wide-ranging experience includes district and appellate venues, criminal and civil arenas, and litigation on issues ranging from tax law to tough cases such as crimes against children. Clare and the other nominees before us today will be kept from serving on the Federal bench because of Republican inaction. My Republican colleagues intend to stop all judicial nominations in July, although there are 79 vacancies pending, 28 of which are considered emergencies. If Ms. Connors is not confirmed, the Hawaii district court seat will be left vacant for over a year. Our judiciary should be composed of the full complement of judges accorded to each district court. One of the fundamental jobs of the Senate to engage in is its advice and consent function with regard to these judicial nominees, and we are not doing that. I call upon my colleagues, my Republican friends, to enable all of us to do our jobs and begin again the advice and consent process which we are, under the Constitution, required to do. I see some other colleagues on the floor, so I yield to my good friend from New York. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York. Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will have a unanimous consent request after I make a few brief remarks. I thank my friends, the Senators from Hawaii and Maryland, for joining me here today. We all know it is the job of the Senate to keep up with the need to confirm judges, but our friends on the other side of the aisle aren't holding up their end of the bargain. The judicial confirmation process has been at a crawl for years. Now it has come to a functional standstill, as noncontroversial nominations--some of which were approved out of committee by overwhelming votes, the majority of Republicans and the majority of Democrats--languish on the Executive Calendar. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle did their best to slow the pace of confirmations when the Senate was under Democratic leadership, and now they are sluggishly moving nominations under a Senate they control. That has culminated in an irresponsible partisan blockade of President Obama's Supreme Court pick. Let's talk about some real numbers. More than 1 year into this new Congress, the Republican leadership has allowed only 17 judges to be confirmed. How many months do we have here? We had 12 in the last year of this Congress, and we are now at the end of April, so that is 4. So that is 16--1 a month. Let me show the contrast. I say to my dear friend, our majority leader, this is the number that counts because the analogy was the last 2 years of the Bush administration when there was a Democratic majority. Then, a Republican President and a Democratic majority; now, a Democratic President and a Republican majority. They confirmed 17 and we confirmed 68. This has consequences--real consequences. The number of vacancies has risen from 43 to 79 since the Republicans took over the majority. That didn't happen when President Bush was President and made nominations. Twenty-eight judicial emergencies. For people seeking justice--they can't get it very speedily because of the obstruction of judges. There are 20 noncontroversial judges on the Executive Calendar. We are urging our colleagues to let these noncontroversial judges go through. Very simply, we are urging our colleagues to do their job. I know the leader wants to have the Senate move along, and we have tried to go along whenever it is possible. But this is a glaring example where it is easy to do your job, where it is easy to move things forward, and all we face is obstruction and for no voiced reason. I would like to know why the judges who I will ask for unanimous consent--it is a smaller list than my colleague from Hawaii has asked to go forward with. I would love to know a single reason why any of them shouldn't be sitting on the bench. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 307, 357, 358, 359, 362, and 363; further, that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations; that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would say to my Democratic friends that no effort to redefine what this is about will be successful. The issue before the Senate is, has President Obama been treated fairly with regard to the confirmation of judges during his tenure in office? We are to a point where we know that so far during the Obama years, he has gotten 23 more judges than President Bush got to this point. That is the fundamental question. Has President Obama been treated in some way differently from President Bush? The answer, of course, is no. Therefore, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Maryland. Unanimous Consent Requests--Executive Calendar Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I will continue to try here, and I thank the Senate majority leader for his patience. This is really not a matter of fairness to the President but fairness to the [[Page S2433]] American people. As my colleague Senator Hirono pointed out, this is a matter of justice delayed is justice denied. We have judicial emergencies--many on our list--that have not been filled. As Senator Schumer pointed out, this is about comparing what has been done on the workload of this Congress to any previous Congress on the confirmation of judges, and we are dead last as far as action that has been taken. I think the critical number is the number of vacancies. Compare the number of vacancies. When the Republicans took the majority, there were 43 vacancies in our courts. That number has almost doubled to 79 vacancies. When we take a look at the pace of confirmation--because we could say maybe there were a lot that had to be taken up over a President's term. But, as Senator Schumer pointed out, there have been only 17 judges confirmed to date. That is one of the lowest numbers in the modern history of our country. In the last year of President Bush's administration, in the same period of time of that 2-year cycle, 68 judges had been confirmed by a Democratically controlled Senate. What makes matters more difficult for the American people to understand is that 20 judicial nominations have currently passed the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe every one has been passed by unanimous voice vote, so they are not controversial. It is just a matter of getting them up for confirmation--20 of them that have yet to be acted on the floor of the Senate. I will make two unanimous consent requests that will deal with 4 of these 20 currently pending. All passed the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice votes. Two are from States that have Democratic Senators and two are from States that have Republican Senators. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar No. 307, Xinis of Maryland; Calendar No. 357, Martinotti of New Jersey; Calendar No. 358, Rossiter of Nebraska; and Calendar No. 359, Stanton of Tennessee; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for the reasons previously expressed by the majority leader, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to make one further request in the series with Senator Hirono and Senator Schumer, and that is to deal with the next nominee who would be up, considering the length of time she has been on the calendar. It is the nomination of Paula Xinis of Maryland made in March 2015--over 1 year ago--by President Obama. She was recommended by Senator Mikulski and me after an exhaustive vetting process that we go through before making recommendations to the President of the United States. She was nominated over 1 year ago. She had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee in July of 2015. As I said earlier, she was reported out of the committee by unanimous voice vote in September of last year, and she has been waiting all this time for action on the Senate floor. We need this vacancy filled. We now have two vacancies in the Maryland District. The chief judge has related to us several times that this position is critical for the administration of justice for the people of Maryland and our Nation. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 307, Xinis of Maryland; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nomination; that any related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for reasons previously given, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to inject a few comments in this discussion too. This isn't all about Republicans. This isn't all about Democrats. I had a nominee from Wyoming. Incidentally, he wasn't nominated by me; he was nominated by our Democratic Governor. It took me about 9 months to get a hearing in committee. This was for a district judge. This wasn't for the Supreme Court. This wasn't for a circuit court. This was for a district court. It took me about 9 months to get a hearing for him. At the end of 2 years, he had not gotten a vote in committee. His life was in suspense for 2 years. That is not right. Neither party should do that. But as long as the other side is saying that we are holding things up, I have to point out that it is not just a one-sided thing. I hope some of the criticism can end and some of the work can be done. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I just want to share in the frustration of my colleague from Wyoming. This should not be a partisan issue. I agree, it is wrong to hold people's lives in abeyance. We are trying to get the very best people to serve on our courts. If they have to put their lives on hold for a year or two, will they come forward and seek to serve as a judge? We know that for the ones we are trying to get on the bench, it is going to be a financial sacrifice. They can make more money in the private sector. We want the very best on our courts. If someone is put on hold for 2 years or for 1 year, it compromises their ability if they are in the private practice of law, and it is not the right thing to do--whether it is a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. We have to act on these appointments a lot faster. The point I raised is that during this term of Congress, during this year and a half, we have seen the number of judicial vacancies go up from 43 to 79. At this particular moment, there are 20 nominees on the Executive Calendar who have cleared the committee by voice vote and who are not controversial. Some have been waiting over a year since their nomination. We can do something about it right now, and we should do something about it right now. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I wish to say a few more things regarding our request for action on these judicial nominations. The group of nominations on which I requested action includes nominees from Maryland, New Jersey, Nebraska, Tennessee, New York, California, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Hawaii. They are all waiting. I have just one comment about the Supreme Court vacancy. The last time the Senate refused to deal with a Supreme Court vacancy was during the Civil War. They so objected to dealing with the President's nomination that the Congress actually changed the number of Justices on the Supreme Court. The number of Justices is set by law, so the Congress changed the law and changed the number of Justices from 10 to 7 so that they would not have to deal with the President's nominee to the Supreme Court vacancy. The President vetoed that bill, the Congress overrode that veto, and so they changed the makeup and number of Justices on the Supreme Court. Certainly that is not what I am suggesting Republicans should do. In fact, we have had a nine-member Supreme Court for almost 150 years. I agree with my friend, the Senator from Wyoming, that this should not be a partisan issue. Certainly, I agree with my friend from Maryland that we should get on with it. We should get on with these judicial nominations. We should do our advice and consent role, and clearly with regard to the Supreme Court vacancy, where, with this inaction, we are going to leave that Court [[Page S2434]] with eight members for a year. That is not acceptable to the people of our country. We need to do our job. I ask my Senate colleagues, my Republican friends, to enable the Senate to do our advice and consent role and do our job as set forth in the U.S. Constitution. I yield the floor. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2427-S2434] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2028, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Pending: Alexander/Feinstein amendment No. 3801, in the nature of a substitute. Alexander amendment No. 3804 (to amendment No. 3801), to modify provisions relating to Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided between the two managers or their designees. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Zika Virus Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, by now we have all seen reports of the neurological damage that is done by the Zika virus. We have seen the damage it can do to newborn infants. It has been clinically linked to serious birth defects in pregnant women who contract it. Since the start of the outbreak, nearly 900 Americans in 41 States, Washington, DC, and 3 U.S. territories--including over 80 pregnant women--have already contracted Zika. In my State of Illinois, 13 people have already tested positive, including at least two pregnant women. But because we have the best scientists and researchers in the world at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we know more today about the virus and prevention measures than we did when most of us first heard the word ``Zika'' a few months ago. We know that mosquitoes spread the disease. We know that the arrival of warm weather signals the start of mosquito season, but America is currently unprepared to deal with an outbreak of this dangerous virus. We must improve vector control. We must expand access to family planning, education, and contraception. We must accelerate efforts to develop a vaccine as quickly as humanly possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention desperately needs funding to deal with this crisis, and they need it now before the summer months, when mosquitoes spread north across the United States. Congress has failed to even consider President Obama's emergency Zika funding request. What on Earth is Congress waiting for? Last week Senate Democrats sent a letter to Senate Republican leadership calling for immediate action to pass the Zika supplemental request. I hope this call for action will be heard by all of my Republican colleagues, but I especially hope that it resonates with my colleagues from the Southern States. These are the States that are the most likely to be hit first and hardest by the Zika mosquito virus: Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, and the list goes on. In the absence of congressional action--immediate congressional action--the administration has been forced to divert funding and resources away from other important public health efforts in order to respond to Zika. This morning's Washington Post headline in a few words tells the story: ``Zika crisis costs states funds for emergency preparedness.'' What does that mean? The President asked for this supplemental request weeks ago. The refusal of the Republican-led Congress to respond to the President's request for emergency public health funds to fight Zika means that we are cutting back on public health preparedness in States all across the Nation. Frankly, we are endangering people whom we represent because the Republican majority in Congress refuses to give the President his supplemental request to deal with the Zika virus. For instance, the administration just had to divert $2 million in public health emergency preparedness grants away from Illinois in order to fight Zika in Southern States. Well, let me tell you, I want to help people everywhere, including those in Southern States who are likely to be hit first, but not at the expense of the public health of the people I represent. There is an answer. President Obama suggests it--an emergency public health supplemental for the Zika virus. The Republican majority in Congress has refused to act. Both the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Chicago Department of Public Health received grants to prepare for and to respond to all kinds of public outbreaks, such as Ebola, Zika, and Elizabethkingia, which I will talk about in a moment. These cuts, which are being proposed in order to have the administration have enough resources to respond, are unacceptable and unexplainable. They come at a time when Illinois, my State, is in the middle of the longest budget crisis in our State's history. This current Governor has been unable to reach an agreement on a budget for almost 11 months, making it difficult for Illinois families and State agencies in ordinary circumstances. But because congressional Republican leaders have failed to pass a Zika emergency public health supplemental requested by President Obama, the administration has had to divert money away from States such as Illinois to respond to the threat of the Zika virus in other States. Is this any way to govern a great Nation? Illinois should not have to lose precious funding to deal with public health threats because Republican congressional leaders--from Southern states, I might add--have refused to pass the necessary additional funding to deal with Zika, a virus that will likely impact their States first and hardest. We have to do both. We should pass the Zika supplemental so Illinois and other States can keep the funding they need to deal with current public health threats and receive additional funding to deal with Zika. Let me talk about why diverting $2 million from my State of Illinois to Southern States for Zika is a challenge. Last week the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 10 cases of a bacterial infection known as Elizabethkingia. It has resulted in six deaths in my State. This bacterial outbreak is separate from an outbreak in Wisconsin that resulted in over 60 cases of this infection. So in the middle of this outbreak, Illinois is losing 8 percent in core funding for public health contingencies because of the failure of Republican leaders in Congress to pass President Obama's emergency public health supplemental appropriation. [[Page S2428]] This means that the Illinois State Department of health is not going to be as prepared as it should be to conduct the needed epidemiology, laboratory testing, and outbreak control. And four of our health experts say there will be major cuts that hurt our ability to respond to public health crises. What happens tomorrow if there is another outbreak? Last year our State dealt with unexpected serious outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease. Taking money from one State's public health defense effort to give it to another to deal with a public health threat makes no sense in a great nation, particularly when the President showed the appropriate leadership in asking for the $1.9 billion emergency supplemental to deal with the Zika crisis, and the President asked over 2 months ago. I know many Republicans are in denial when it comes to climate change, but if they would have been in Springfield, IL, my home, last Sunday--just 2 days ago--sitting out on the deck in 80-degree weather in April, they might understand warm weather is coming sooner across the United States and with that warm weather, mosquitoes, and with those mosquitoes, the threat of the Zika virus. I don't come to raise an alarm that is unmerited and unwarranted. I believe this is a serious public health challenge, so serious we should not leave Congress this week and take a recess without passing the President's emergency budget supplemental for public health and the Zika virus. The mosquitoes are not going to be on recess next week, they are going to be working, and sadly they are going to be infecting people across the South and across the United States while congressional leaders dither. The supplemental request would provide more than $1.8 billion in emergency funding to improve CDC vector control to control the mosquitoes that threaten us. It would accelerate efforts at the National Institutes of Health to develop a vaccine. I have heard testimony, so I know it takes time to develop a vaccine. Let's do it in an expeditious, safe, thoughtful, and professional way, but let us not shortchange NIH or any other agency that is facing this crisis. We need to expand education. We need to expand access to women's health planning services. The administration provided a comprehensive plan. It cannot be implemented successfully without resources, and we should act on it this week--get it done before we leave. I joined my colleagues Senator Nelson, Leader Reid, Senator Schumer, and Senator Hirono in introducing a bill to fully fund the administration's request. I am pleased to hear my Republican colleagues on the Committee on Appropriations are interested in working with Democrats to reach a deal. I see Senator Alexander on the floor. I know he is sensitive to this, and I hope he will join in calling for leadership on both sides of the Rotunda to move on this issue before we take our recess. Let us not delay this any longer. We need to ensure we aren't diverting necessary Ebola money to be used for the Zika virus. It is naive to believe the Ebola threat is gone and we can ignore the possibility of its reemergence. In my State and others, we know all too well what happens when you divert money from one public health fund to another. This brings to mind the Biblical story of Noah and the great flood. Noah built the arc before the rain, not after it started. It is reckless, it is dangerous to delay. The cases of Zika are continuing to grow, and inaction and further delay put many families, pregnant women, and children in jeopardy. We have seen the Zika threat coming for many months. We have had the President's request for over 2 months. I urge my colleagues this week, before we go home, to take this appropriate action to begin to protect Americans in every State. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, at 11 a.m. we will have three votes on the Merkley, Flake, and Reid amendments. That will bring to a total of 17 the number of amendments we will have disposed of on the floor. Senator Feinstein and I have worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to include many of their policy suggestions and requests in our basic bill. The last count I saw said 77 Members of the Senate had at least part of their requests or policy suggestions in our basic bill. So we are doing very well. Cloture has been filed. There are only a few amendments remaining that are in question. We hope to conclude that quickly and bring the bill to a conclusion. My hope is that when a Senator has a germane amendment, we can have a vote. Sometimes, if they are controversial, they will be at 60. We have done pretty well with that so far--giving Senators a chance to have a say and to have a vote. I would like to spend about 4 or 5 minutes on an amendment we will be voting on at 11, when we will have limited time to talk--unless Senator Feinstein has something she would like to say before I do that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, as I understand it, the filing deadline for first- degree amendments is this afternoon at either 1:30 p.m. or 2:30 p.m. So everybody should get their amendments in. I thank Senator Alexander again for the cooperative spirit with which he is working on this bill. It is very much appreciated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to speak to the amendment from the Senator from Oregon, which would increase the funding for the wind energy program by $15.4 million. This is in addition to the $30 million that our subcommittee has recommended at the request of Senator Gardner of Colorado for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the $50 million Senator Collins of Maine has recommended for offshore wind research. Within the priorities in the bill, we have already put $80 million, and this would add $15 million more. That may not seem like much, but here is my question: I wonder if the American taxpayers wouldn't think that $23 billion is enough to spend on giant windmills--$23 billion. That is the amount the Congressional Research Service has said Congress has spent of taxpayer money to subsidize wealthy people so they can build giant wind turbines across America. That money has been spent from 1992 through 2016 this year. It started out as an effort to help wind turbines get started in 1992, and it has been renewed 10 times. You would think this is a mature industry. In fact, the previous Energy Secretary said it was. What do we get for this $23 billion? Four percent of our electricity is produced by wind turbines in the United States. This is a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world, and we spend $23 billion for 4 percent of our electricity. Thirty-seven percent of all the subsidies, all the spending we have for different forms of energy produces 4 percent of the electricity. The President of the United States and a number of private people in the United States, such as Bill Gates, have announced they would like to double energy research. I support that. The Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and I introduced legislation that would authorize increased funding at the level of 7 percent for energy research this year so we can move more rapidly toward the goal of doubling research for energy. We spend $5 billion a year for energy research for the U.S. Government. We spend nearly $5 billion a year on subsidizing wealthy people so they can build giant wind turbines. We spend as much subsidizing windmills as we spend on all our energy research. If we stop the subsidies, we could double the research, which is what we should be doing. What are we getting for this? We are getting energy--electricity-- that is true, but it mostly blows at night, when we don't need it. It can't be stored for use when we do need it. So it is unreliable. The wind only blows about one-third of the time. In Tennessee it is 18 percent of the time. It can't be stored and we don't need it. We don't need it. At the same time, it destroys the landscape. I am astonished at the environmental groups that would support putting [[Page S2429]] these huge giant turbines in the most beautiful part of our country and then building transmission lines across the country through everybody's backyard. If we replace the 100 nuclear reactors in this country that produce 60 percent of the carbon-free electricity we have--60 percent of the carbon-free electricity--it would take enough windmills to cover a State the size of West Virginia, and I think you would have to have about 17,000 miles, 19,000 miles of new transmission lines. The Presiding Officer is the Senator from Arkansas. In Arkansas, a windmill company is building 700 miles of transmission lines across Arkansas that the State doesn't want and has objected to. Yet the administration is allowing the wind mill company to use Federal preemption for the first time to build transmission lines where people don't want them. Not only is this a wasteful amount of money, not only is it a kind of energy that a country this big cannot rely on, the size of the subsidies create preposterous results. For example, in some cases the subsidy is so large the windmill-producing companies pay the utilities to take their power and they still make a profit. They can pay the utilities to take their power and still make a profit because the taxpayers have spent $23 billion subsidizing wealthy people so they can build windmills. These aren't your grandma's windmills. You can see them for 20 miles away--the flashing lights. They are twice as tall as the football stadium at the University of Tennessee, and only one of these would fit within the football stadium at the University of Tennessee. It would take four nuclear reactors, each taking about 1 square mile, to produce enough electricity to equal the same amount of electricity produced by wind if you strung 45-foot windmill towers along the entire 2,178-mile stretch of the Appalachian Trail. You may say that is a stretch, that will not happen, except that is exactly where the wind towers would be most likely to go--on our scenic mountain tops where more wind blows, and then the transmission lines come down the mountain tops through your backyard. My objection is a very simple one. I think $23 billion is enough to spend on windmills. I have other objections to wind. I think we should focus on nuclear power instead of unreliable wind power. I believe trying to use wind turbines to power a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world is the energy equivalent of going to war in sailboats when the nuclear navy is available, but I certainly think there is no need at all for Senators to say yes to an amendment that spends more money for wind than our subcommittee recommended. We are already spending $23 billion. The taxpayers have been bamboozled into allowing that to happen, and I don't think they would want us to spend more. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Flake amendment No. 3820, which would lower the construction appropriation for the U.S. Corps of Engineers by just under $69 million and eliminate funding for environmental infrastructure projects. Ostensibly, the Corps of Engineers uses these funds to build water supply, water treatment, and wastewater projects. I am not here to argue against the need for environmental infrastructure projects. There are a great many municipalities that consider these projects essential and have made an effort to fund them on their own. That is usually done through a combination of utility bills and municipal bonds. Typically, the users pay for this. However, despite the fact that these projects have traditionally been funded by State and local governments, Federal support is actually duplicative. The Federal Government already offers resources for similar projects through the EPA. Specifically, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund programs provide States with low-interest loans based on the merits of these projects and the needs of the communities. Taxpayers deserve better than to be expected to provide the U.S. Corps of Engineers $69 million it never asked for to fund projects they already support in a program that has been described by many as a slush fund for parochial interests. That is certainly how the program started years ago. Frankly, it has never seemed clear that the Corps of Engineers understands how these projects fit into its mission. Because of a years-old congressional carve-out, these environmental undertakings are not subject to the environmental studies, economic analyses, and cost-effectiveness standards that are required for more traditional Corps projects. As far as I can tell, there is really no rhyme or reason as to how one project gets funding over another. With a national debt of over $19 trillion, it is time that we get a little more serious about putting our fiscal house in order. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and eliminate this duplicative funding. Mr. President, I wish to say a couple words about Reid-Heller amendment No. 3805. I support the Colorado River System Conservation Program. Voluntary efforts like these in Arizona are estimated to have kept Lake Mead at about 3 feet higher than it would have been otherwise. Not coincidentally, last week the Bureau of Reclamation announced that at the end of this year, Lake Mead is predicted to be 3 feet above the level that would trigger a shortage declaration. What I want to make sure happens is that any conserved water actually stays in Lake Mead and keeps these levels up above the shortage declaration area. I note that this amendment simply authorizes funds to go to the conservation program. I hope that before this money is actually spent, we can develop assurances that the water will go to its intended purpose. The Lower Colorado River Basin States have developed such language, and I look forward to ensuring that our Federal dollars are well spent in this area. Amendment No. 3820 to Amendment No. 3801 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3820 and ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the amendment by number. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Flake] proposes an amendment numbered 3820 to amendment No. 3801. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To withhold certain funds for the construction of environmental infrastructure) On page 3, line 11, strike ``$1,813,649,000'' and insert ``$1,744,699,000''. Mr. FLAKE. I yield the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Amendment No. 3812 to Amendment No. 3801 (Purpose: To provide for funding for wind energy) Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3812. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Merkley] proposes an amendment numbered 3812 to amendment No. 3801. On page 23, line 15, strike the period at the end and insert the following: ``: Provided further, That of such amount, $95,400,000 shall be available for wind energy.''. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I wish to add a few remarks about this, as we are preparing shortly to consider a number of amendments. This particular amendment is a bipartisan amendment, which I am pleased to sponsor with my partner from Iowa, stating that wind energy is particularly important. This amendment would restore funding for wind energy research to fiscal year 2016 levels of $95.4 million. Otherwise, research in wind energy would suffer a substantial reduction. This program is indispensable to the success of wind energy in the United States. The wind energy program works to advance innovations in the grid integration, manufacturing, and deployment that are key to reducing the cost of wind energy. For example, the Wind Program helps to address market barriers through including wind-forecasting tools in power system operations, which helps utilities and regulators better integrate large amounts of wind energy into the grid. [[Page S2430]] The Wind Program provides research, development, and technical support to manufacturers and distributors of wind technologies that are still emerging. This enhances small wind manufacturing, supports offshore demonstration projects, and will improve the economic viability of distributed wind. Currently, eight National Laboratories across our Nation conduct research or testing related to wind energy. The proposed fiscal year 2017 funding level is only $80 million, which is over $15 million less than last year's funding--thwarting our ability to realize the true potential for wind energy. During debates, we have sometimes heard that wind is a mature industry and that is why the funding for research should be revoked or lowered. But in fact, as wind is emerging, we are seeing continuous innovations resulting in different designs and different strategies for integrating intermittent wind energy into the grid. As that wind component becomes substantially larger, we need to understand the details of how we accommodate it effectively. If we were to talk about mature industries, then we wouldn't be doing studies for the fossil fuel industry, which is about as mature as an industry can get. Clearly, this is an evolving industry with great potential to assist us with clean energy and, moreover, a program that can affect the economy of rural America. In 2015 wind energy supplied about 5 percent of the total electricity generated in the United States. So it is no longer just a fraction of a percent; it has grown enormously in the last few years. But the Department of Energy estimates that wind could provide as much as 35 percent--or more than one-third--of the electricity generated in our country by the year 2050. As my colleague and partner on this bill, the Senator from Iowa, knows, wind energy can be a huge boon to a State's economy. Iowa is already getting over 30 percent of its electricity from wind. And because wind energy is less expensive in the forecast of potential other sources, it could result in billions of dollars of savings to energy consumers in that State. In my home State of Oregon, we already have over 10 percent of our electricity being generated from wind energy. The savings for our State down the road could be enormous, but we can only reach these goals if we support wind energy research. With the development of wind energy comes hundreds of thousands of jobs in manufacturing, in installation, in maintenance, and in supporting services. The estimate is around 600,000 jobs--generally good-paying jobs--by the year 2015. I do a lot of townhalls back home in Oregon, one in every county every year. Much of Oregon is very rural. I hear about the impact property taxes on these wind installations have on our rural counties, enabling them to do things--for example, to build libraries or assist in the development of their local schools. There is no question that this is a boon to the rural economy. It is our job in Congress to look at what policies will be the most successful and give the most bang for the buck in terms of creating jobs now and in the future. We should be supporting programs that spur economic development and support families in rural areas. That is what this amendment calls for. When we create jobs, local communities benefit, certainly the energy industry benefits, and our environment benefits. All of this depends upon robust research, and we are simply asking that research continue at the same level it did in fiscal year 2016. Let's back red, white, and blue, American-made wind energy and support this bipartisan amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so ordered. There are now 2 minutes equally divided on amendment No. 3812. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we will be voting on amendment No. 3812, which my colleague from Iowa and I have put together to restore research on wind development to the level it was last year. When you see these wind turbines, what you should see is economic development in highly deserving rural communities, putting clean electrons onto the grid, putting jobs into the community, and putting money into the property tax coffers in local communities to do good work. I wish to reserve the rest of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Does the Senator from Tennessee wish to use his time on the amendment? Mr. ALEXANDER. I do, but I will wait until the end. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one uses time, time will be charged equally to both sides. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, can I not reserve the rest of my time? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not at this point. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, don't you think $23 billion is enough to spend on windmills? That is what we have spent since 1992--$23 billion for 4 percent of America's electricity. This is electricity that is unreliable. The windmills blow about one-third of the time, often at night, and it can't be stored. We will spend $5 billion this year and $4.4 billion next year. We could double our energy research spending if we would stop subsidizing wealthy people to build giant wind turbines. Sixty percent of our carbon-free electricity comes from nuclear reactors. Relying on giant wind turbines and new transmission lines to power a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world is like going to war in sailboats when the nuclear Navy is available. We already have $80 million going to research, which Senator Gardner and Senator Collins have asked us to include in the legislation. It is in the bill. We don't need to spend more. We have already spent $23 billion since 1992. Spending $4 or $5 billion a year is more than enough to spend on giant wind turbines. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Merkley amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, these subsidies are a tiny dot compared to the $52 billion spent annually on fossil fuel subsidies and the massive subsidies spent on nuclear. Yet these subsidies are creating jobs in rural America, and that matters. These communities need these jobs. These are clean electrons, these are terrific middle-class jobs, and this is an industry that is still on a curve where research is truly beneficial in making it a success. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey). Mr. DURBIN.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada. Amendment No. 3805 to Amendment No. 3801 Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Reid, I call up the Reid-Heller amendment No. 3805 and ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the amendment by number. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Heller], for Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 3805 to amendment No. 3801. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To make funding for water management improvement subject to a condition) In section 204, strike ``and inserting `$400,000,000' '' and insert ``and inserting `$450,000,000, on the condition that of that amount, $50,000,000 is used to carry out section 206 of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (43 U.S.C. 620 note; Public Law 113- 235)' ''. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada. Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, the Colorado River is the lifeblood of the West. It supplies many of our communities with the majority of its water. The ongoing drought is threatening shortages, reviving the old Mark Twain saying that ``whiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting over.'' In response, the West has teamed up to establish the Colorado River System Conservation Pilot Program, an innovative effort to improve levels in our reservoirs. It is very clear the program is working well. Nineteen agreements have come together, saving 80,000 acre-feet, enough western water for 160,000 households. Increasing our region's water security is essential to Western States. Without water, we cannot grow. I would urge this body to support this extremely important western initiative. I yield the floor. I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this amendment does not increase funding in the bill and the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and I intend to vote for it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second.

Amendment No. 3820 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 3820, offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Flake. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, this amendment would simply cut $69 million in unrequested funding for Corps of Engineers projects. This is kind of the outgrowth of the bad old days when we had earmarks, when all of this funding came about. We now have an earmark ban, but some of the funding still goes to some projects that have not even been requested. If we have a debt of $19 trillion and a deficit of $500 billion, it is time that we actually make some cuts somewhere. I would submit that this is a place ripe for cutting. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am going to oppose the Flake amendment. The Army Corps of Engineers rebuilds locks and dams, dredges our rivers and harbors, works to prevent floods and storm damage, and builds environmental restoration projects. There is not a funding line in the budget that more Senators seek for their States. Our spending is under control on the discretionary side. It is the mandatory spending, the entitlement spending, that is out of control. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also strongly oppose this amendment. This would eliminate funding for our environmental infrastructure projects of the Army Corps of Engineers. Funding for these projects enables communities to solve local problems in a way that protects the environment. Problems are being solved, such as upgrading wastewater treatment facilities, so that our drinking water and marine resources are protected, and replacing deteriorated distribution systems with efficient systems that help conserve water. I hope we will vote this amendment down. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3820. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey). Mr. DURBIN.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 307, 357, 358, 359, 362, 363, 364, 459, 460, 461, and 508; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I understand our Democratic friends are going to propound a number of different unanimous consent requests here with regard, I assume, to the judiciary. The core question here is whether President Obama has been treated fairly, and I think it is noteworthy that at this point in President Bush's 8 years, 303 of his judicial nominees had been confirmed. At this point in President Obama's term, the number is 324. That is 21 more judges the current President has gotten at this point than President Bush. Clearly, President Obama has been treated fairly and, therefore, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I am very disappointed the Republicans are blocking dozens of qualified nominees--nominees who have been reported to the Senate floor on a bipartisan basis. This is certainly, in my view, not about whether the President is being treated fairly, but it is about the Senate doing its job. The Senate is on track to confirm the lowest number of judicial nominees in our history. Let me mention a nominee from Hawaii: Clare Connors. She was confirmed or voted on unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last month, a statement to her qualifications. Her wide-ranging experience includes district and appellate venues, criminal and civil arenas, and litigation on issues ranging from tax law to tough cases such as crimes against children. Clare and the other nominees before us today will be kept from serving on the Federal bench because of Republican inaction. My Republican colleagues intend to stop all judicial nominations in July, although there are 79 vacancies pending, 28 of which are considered emergencies. If Ms. Connors is not confirmed, the Hawaii district court seat will be left vacant for over a year. Our judiciary should be composed of the full complement of judges accorded to each district court. One of the fundamental jobs of the Senate to engage in is its advice and consent function with regard to these judicial nominees, and we are not doing that. I call upon my colleagues, my Republican friends, to enable all of us to do our jobs and begin again the advice and consent process which we are, under the Constitution, required to do. I see some other colleagues on the floor, so I yield to my good friend from New York. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York. Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will have a unanimous consent request after I make a few brief remarks. I thank my friends, the Senators from Hawaii and Maryland, for joining me here today. We all know it is the job of the Senate to keep up with the need to confirm judges, but our friends on the other side of the aisle aren't holding up their end of the bargain. The judicial confirmation process has been at a crawl for years. Now it has come to a functional standstill, as noncontroversial nominations--some of which were approved out of committee by overwhelming votes, the majority of Republicans and the majority of Democrats--languish on the Executive Calendar. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle did their best to slow the pace of confirmations when the Senate was under Democratic leadership, and now they are sluggishly moving nominations under a Senate they control. That has culminated in an irresponsible partisan blockade of President Obama's Supreme Court pick. Let's talk about some real numbers. More than 1 year into this new Congress, the Republican leadership has allowed only 17 judges to be confirmed. How many months do we have here? We had 12 in the last year of this Congress, and we are now at the end of April, so that is 4. So that is 16--1 a month. Let me show the contrast. I say to my dear friend, our majority leader, this is the number that counts because the analogy was the last 2 years of the Bush administration when there was a Democratic majority. Then, a Republican President and a Democratic majority; now, a Democratic President and a Republican majority. They confirmed 17 and we confirmed 68. This has consequences--real consequences. The number of vacancies has risen from 43 to 79 since the Republicans took over the majority. That didn't happen when President Bush was President and made nominations. Twenty-eight judicial emergencies. For people seeking justice--they can't get it very speedily because of the obstruction of judges. There are 20 noncontroversial judges on the Executive Calendar. We are urging our colleagues to let these noncontroversial judges go through. Very simply, we are urging our colleagues to do their job. I know the leader wants to have the Senate move along, and we have tried to go along whenever it is possible. But this is a glaring example where it is easy to do your job, where it is easy to move things forward, and all we face is obstruction and for no voiced reason. I would like to know why the judges who I will ask for unanimous consent--it is a smaller list than my colleague from Hawaii has asked to go forward with. I would love to know a single reason why any of them shouldn't be sitting on the bench. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 307, 357, 358, 359, 362, and 363; further, that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations; that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would say to my Democratic friends that no effort to redefine what this is about will be successful. The issue before the Senate is, has President Obama been treated fairly with regard to the confirmation of judges during his tenure in office? We are to a point where we know that so far during the Obama years, he has gotten 23 more judges than President Bush got to this point. That is the fundamental question. Has President Obama been treated in some way differently from President Bush? The answer, of course, is no. Therefore, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Maryland. Unanimous Consent Requests--Executive Calendar Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I will continue to try here, and I thank the Senate majority leader for his patience. This is really not a matter of fairness to the President but fairness to the [[Page S2433]] American people. As my colleague Senator Hirono pointed out, this is a matter of justice delayed is justice denied. We have judicial emergencies--many on our list--that have not been filled. As Senator Schumer pointed out, this is about comparing what has been done on the workload of this Congress to any previous Congress on the confirmation of judges, and we are dead last as far as action that has been taken. I think the critical number is the number of vacancies. Compare the number of vacancies. When the Republicans took the majority, there were 43 vacancies in our courts. That number has almost doubled to 79 vacancies. When we take a look at the pace of confirmation--because we could say maybe there were a lot that had to be taken up over a President's term. But, as Senator Schumer pointed out, there have been only 17 judges confirmed to date. That is one of the lowest numbers in the modern history of our country. In the last year of President Bush's administration, in the same period of time of that 2-year cycle, 68 judges had been confirmed by a Democratically controlled Senate. What makes matters more difficult for the American people to understand is that 20 judicial nominations have currently passed the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe every one has been passed by unanimous voice vote, so they are not controversial. It is just a matter of getting them up for confirmation--20 of them that have yet to be acted on the floor of the Senate. I will make two unanimous consent requests that will deal with 4 of these 20 currently pending. All passed the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice votes. Two are from States that have Democratic Senators and two are from States that have Republican Senators. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar No. 307, Xinis of Maryland; Calendar No. 357, Martinotti of New Jersey; Calendar No. 358, Rossiter of Nebraska; and Calendar No. 359, Stanton of Tennessee; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for the reasons previously expressed by the majority leader, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to make one further request in the series with Senator Hirono and Senator Schumer, and that is to deal with the next nominee who would be up, considering the length of time she has been on the calendar. It is the nomination of Paula Xinis of Maryland made in March 2015--over 1 year ago--by President Obama. She was recommended by Senator Mikulski and me after an exhaustive vetting process that we go through before making recommendations to the President of the United States. She was nominated over 1 year ago. She had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee in July of 2015. As I said earlier, she was reported out of the committee by unanimous voice vote in September of last year, and she has been waiting all this time for action on the Senate floor. We need this vacancy filled. We now have two vacancies in the Maryland District. The chief judge has related to us several times that this position is critical for the administration of justice for the people of Maryland and our Nation. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 307, Xinis of Maryland; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nomination; that any related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for reasons previously given, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to inject a few comments in this discussion too. This isn't all about Republicans. This isn't all about Democrats. I had a nominee from Wyoming. Incidentally, he wasn't nominated by me; he was nominated by our Democratic Governor. It took me about 9 months to get a hearing in committee. This was for a district judge. This wasn't for the Supreme Court. This wasn't for a circuit court. This was for a district court. It took me about 9 months to get a hearing for him. At the end of 2 years, he had not gotten a vote in committee. His life was in suspense for 2 years. That is not right. Neither party should do that. But as long as the other side is saying that we are holding things up, I have to point out that it is not just a one-sided thing. I hope some of the criticism can end and some of the work can be done. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I just want to share in the frustration of my colleague from Wyoming. This should not be a partisan issue. I agree, it is wrong to hold people's lives in abeyance. We are trying to get the very best people to serve on our courts. If they have to put their lives on hold for a year or two, will they come forward and seek to serve as a judge? We know that for the ones we are trying to get on the bench, it is going to be a financial sacrifice. They can make more money in the private sector. We want the very best on our courts. If someone is put on hold for 2 years or for 1 year, it compromises their ability if they are in the private practice of law, and it is not the right thing to do--whether it is a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. We have to act on these appointments a lot faster. The point I raised is that during this term of Congress, during this year and a half, we have seen the number of judicial vacancies go up from 43 to 79. At this particular moment, there are 20 nominees on the Executive Calendar who have cleared the committee by voice vote and who are not controversial. Some have been waiting over a year since their nomination. We can do something about it right now, and we should do something about it right now. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I wish to say a few more things regarding our request for action on these judicial nominations. The group of nominations on which I requested action includes nominees from Maryland, New Jersey, Nebraska, Tennessee, New York, California, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Hawaii. They are all waiting. I have just one comment about the Supreme Court vacancy. The last time the Senate refused to deal with a Supreme Court vacancy was during the Civil War. They so objected to dealing with the President's nomination that the Congress actually changed the number of Justices on the Supreme Court. The number of Justices is set by law, so the Congress changed the law and changed the number of Justices from 10 to 7 so that they would not have to deal with the President's nominee to the Supreme Court vacancy. The President vetoed that bill, the Congress overrode that veto, and so they changed the makeup and number of Justices on the Supreme Court. Certainly that is not what I am suggesting Republicans should do. In fact, we have had a nine-member Supreme Court for almost 150 years. I agree with my friend, the Senator from Wyoming, that this should not be a partisan issue. Certainly, I agree with my friend from Maryland that we should get on with it. We should get on with these judicial nominations. We should do our advice and consent role, and clearly with regard to the Supreme Court vacancy, where, with this inaction, we are going to leave that Court [[Page S2434]] with eight members for a year. That is not acceptable to the people of our country. We need to do our job. I ask my Senate colleagues, my Republican friends, to enable the Senate to do our advice and consent role and do our job as set forth in the U.S. Constitution. I yield the floor. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,54523,54523,54591,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [senate] [pages s2427-s2434] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] energy and water development and related agencies appropriations act, 2016 the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of h.r. 2028, which the clerk will report. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: a bill (h.r. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30, 2016, and for other purposes. pending: alexander/feinstein amendment no. 3801, in the nature of a substitute. alexander amendment no. 3804 (to amendment no. 3801), to modify provisions relating to nuclear regulatory commission fees. the presiding officer. under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided between the two managers or their designees. mr. reid. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. durbin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. mr. durbin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. zika virus mr. durbin. mr. president, by now we have all seen reports of the neurological damage that is done by the zika virus. we have seen the damage it can do to newborn infants. it has been clinically linked to serious birth defects in pregnant women who contract it. since the start of the outbreak, nearly 900 americans in 41 states, washington, dc, and 3 u.s. territories--including over 80 pregnant women--have already contracted zika. in my state of illinois, 13 people have already tested positive, including at least two pregnant women. but because we have the best scientists and researchers in the world at the centers for disease control and prevention, we know more today about the virus and prevention measures than we did when most of us first heard the word ``zika'' a few months ago. we know that mosquitoes spread the disease. we know that the arrival of warm weather signals the start of mosquito season, but america is currently unprepared to deal with an outbreak of this dangerous virus. we must improve vector control. we must expand access to family planning, education, and contraception. we must accelerate efforts to develop a vaccine as quickly as humanly possible. the centers for disease control and prevention desperately needs funding to deal with this crisis, and they need it now before the summer months, when mosquitoes spread north across the united states. congress has failed to even consider president obama's emergency zika funding request. what on earth is congress waiting for? last week senate democrats sent a letter to senate republican leadership calling for immediate action to pass the zika supplemental request. i hope this call for action will be heard by all of my republican colleagues, but i especially hope that it resonates with my colleagues from the southern states. these are the states that are the most likely to be hit first and hardest by the zika mosquito virus: florida, mississippi, louisiana, texas, alabama, arkansas, and the list goes on. in the absence of congressional action--immediate congressional action--the administration has been forced to divert funding and resources away from other important public health efforts in order to respond to zika. this morning's washington post headline in a few words tells the story: ``zika crisis costs states funds for emergency preparedness.'' what does that mean? the president asked for this supplemental request weeks ago. the refusal of the republican-led congress to respond to the president's request for emergency public health funds to fight zika means that we are cutting back on public health preparedness in states all across the nation. frankly, we are endangering people whom we represent because the republican majority in congress refuses to give the president his supplemental request to deal with the zika virus. for instance, the administration just had to divert $2 million in public health emergency preparedness grants away from illinois in order to fight zika in southern states. well, let me tell you, i want to help people everywhere, including those in southern states who are likely to be hit first, but not at the expense of the public health of the people i represent. there is an answer. president obama suggests it--an emergency public health supplemental for the zika virus. the republican majority in congress has refused to act. both the illinois department of public health and the chicago department of public health received grants to prepare for and to respond to all kinds of public outbreaks, such as ebola, zika, and elizabethkingia, which i will talk about in a moment. these cuts, which are being proposed in order to have the administration have enough resources to respond, are unacceptable and unexplainable. they come at a time when illinois, my state, is in the middle of the longest budget crisis in our state's history. this current governor has been unable to reach an agreement on a budget for almost 11 months, making it difficult for illinois families and state agencies in ordinary circumstances. but because congressional republican leaders have failed to pass a zika emergency public health supplemental requested by president obama, the administration has had to divert money away from states such as illinois to respond to the threat of the zika virus in other states. is this any way to govern a great nation? illinois should not have to lose precious funding to deal with public health threats because republican congressional leaders--from southern states, i might add--have refused to pass the necessary additional funding to deal with zika, a virus that will likely impact their states first and hardest. we have to do both. we should pass the zika supplemental so illinois and other states can keep the funding they need to deal with current public health threats and receive additional funding to deal with zika. let me talk about why diverting $2 million from my state of illinois to southern states for zika is a challenge. last week the illinois department of public health and the centers for disease control and prevention confirmed 10 cases of a bacterial infection known as elizabethkingia. it has resulted in six deaths in my state. this bacterial outbreak is separate from an outbreak in wisconsin that resulted in over 60 cases of this infection. so in the middle of this outbreak, illinois is losing 8 percent in core funding for public health contingencies because of the failure of republican leaders in congress to pass president obama's emergency public health supplemental appropriation. [[page s2428]] this means that the illinois state department of health is not going to be as prepared as it should be to conduct the needed epidemiology, laboratory testing, and outbreak control. and four of our health experts say there will be major cuts that hurt our ability to respond to public health crises. what happens tomorrow if there is another outbreak? last year our state dealt with unexpected serious outbreaks of legionnaires' disease. taking money from one state's public health defense effort to give it to another to deal with a public health threat makes no sense in a great nation, particularly when the president showed the appropriate leadership in asking for the $1.9 billion emergency supplemental to deal with the zika crisis, and the president asked over 2 months ago. i know many republicans are in denial when it comes to climate change, but if they would have been in springfield, il, my home, last sunday--just 2 days ago--sitting out on the deck in 80-degree weather in april, they might understand warm weather is coming sooner across the united states and with that warm weather, mosquitoes, and with those mosquitoes, the threat of the zika virus. i don't come to raise an alarm that is unmerited and unwarranted. i believe this is a serious public health challenge, so serious we should not leave congress this week and take a recess without passing the president's emergency budget supplemental for public health and the zika virus. the mosquitoes are not going to be on recess next week, they are going to be working, and sadly they are going to be infecting people across the south and across the united states while congressional leaders dither. the supplemental request would provide more than $1.8 billion in emergency funding to improve cdc vector control to control the mosquitoes that threaten us. it would accelerate efforts at the national institutes of health to develop a vaccine. i have heard testimony, so i know it takes time to develop a vaccine. let's do it in an expeditious, safe, thoughtful, and professional way, but let us not shortchange nih or any other agency that is facing this crisis. we need to expand education. we need to expand access to women's health planning services. the administration provided a comprehensive plan. it cannot be implemented successfully without resources, and we should act on it this week--get it done before we leave. i joined my colleagues senator nelson, leader reid, senator schumer, and senator hirono in introducing a bill to fully fund the administration's request. i am pleased to hear my republican colleagues on the committee on appropriations are interested in working with democrats to reach a deal. i see senator alexander on the floor. i know he is sensitive to this, and i hope he will join in calling for leadership on both sides of the rotunda to move on this issue before we take our recess. let us not delay this any longer. we need to ensure we aren't diverting necessary ebola money to be used for the zika virus. it is naive to believe the ebola threat is gone and we can ignore the possibility of its reemergence. in my state and others, we know all too well what happens when you divert money from one public health fund to another. this brings to mind the biblical story of noah and the great flood. noah built the arc before the rain, not after it started. it is reckless, it is dangerous to delay. the cases of zika are continuing to grow, and inaction and further delay put many families, pregnant women, and children in jeopardy. we have seen the zika threat coming for many months. we have had the president's request for over 2 months. i urge my colleagues this week, before we go home, to take this appropriate action to begin to protect americans in every state. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from tennessee. mr. alexander. mr. president, at 11 a.m. we will have three votes on the merkley, flake, and reid amendments. that will bring to a total of 17 the number of amendments we will have disposed of on the floor. senator feinstein and i have worked with members on both sides of the aisle to include many of their policy suggestions and requests in our basic bill. the last count i saw said 77 members of the senate had at least part of their requests or policy suggestions in our basic bill. so we are doing very well. cloture has been filed. there are only a few amendments remaining that are in question. we hope to conclude that quickly and bring the bill to a conclusion. my hope is that when a senator has a germane amendment, we can have a vote. sometimes, if they are controversial, they will be at 60. we have done pretty well with that so far--giving senators a chance to have a say and to have a vote. i would like to spend about 4 or 5 minutes on an amendment we will be voting on at 11, when we will have limited time to talk--unless senator feinstein has something she would like to say before i do that. the presiding officer. the senator from california. mrs. feinstein. i thank the chair. mr. president, as i understand it, the filing deadline for first- degree amendments is this afternoon at either 1:30 p.m. or 2:30 p.m. so everybody should get their amendments in. i thank senator alexander again for the cooperative spirit with which he is working on this bill. it is very much appreciated. the presiding officer. the senator from tennessee. mr. alexander. mr. president, i want to speak to the amendment from the senator from oregon, which would increase the funding for the wind energy program by $15.4 million. this is in addition to the $30 million that our subcommittee has recommended at the request of senator gardner of colorado for the national renewable energy laboratory and the $50 million senator collins of maine has recommended for offshore wind research. within the priorities in the bill, we have already put $80 million, and this would add $15 million more. that may not seem like much, but here is my question: i wonder if the american taxpayers wouldn't think that $23 billion is enough to spend on giant windmills--$23 billion. that is the amount the congressional research service has said congress has spent of taxpayer money to subsidize wealthy people so they can build giant wind turbines across america. that money has been spent from 1992 through 2016 this year. it started out as an effort to help wind turbines get started in 1992, and it has been renewed 10 times. you would think this is a mature industry. in fact, the previous energy secretary said it was. what do we get for this $23 billion? four percent of our electricity is produced by wind turbines in the united states. this is a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world, and we spend $23 billion for 4 percent of our electricity. thirty-seven percent of all the subsidies, all the spending we have for different forms of energy produces 4 percent of the electricity. the president of the united states and a number of private people in the united states, such as bill gates, have announced they would like to double energy research. i support that. the senator from illinois, mr. durbin, and i introduced legislation that would authorize increased funding at the level of 7 percent for energy research this year so we can move more rapidly toward the goal of doubling research for energy. we spend $5 billion a year for energy research for the u.s. government. we spend nearly $5 billion a year on subsidizing wealthy people so they can build giant wind turbines. we spend as much subsidizing windmills as we spend on all our energy research. if we stop the subsidies, we could double the research, which is what we should be doing. what are we getting for this? we are getting energy--electricity-- that is true, but it mostly blows at night, when we don't need it. it can't be stored for use when we do need it. so it is unreliable. the wind only blows about one-third of the time. in tennessee it is 18 percent of the time. it can't be stored and we don't need it. we don't need it. at the same time, it destroys the landscape. i am astonished at the environmental groups that would support putting [[page s2429]] these huge giant turbines in the most beautiful part of our country and then building transmission lines across the country through everybody's backyard. if we replace the 100 nuclear reactors in this country that produce 60 percent of the carbon-free electricity we have--60 percent of the carbon-free electricity--it would take enough windmills to cover a state the size of west virginia, and i think you would have to have about 17,000 miles, 19,000 miles of new transmission lines. the presiding officer is the senator from arkansas. in arkansas, a windmill company is building 700 miles of transmission lines across arkansas that the state doesn't want and has objected to. yet the administration is allowing the wind mill company to use federal preemption for the first time to build transmission lines where people don't want them. not only is this a wasteful amount of money, not only is it a kind of energy that a country this big cannot rely on, the size of the subsidies create preposterous results. for example, in some cases the subsidy is so large the windmill-producing companies pay the utilities to take their power and they still make a profit. they can pay the utilities to take their power and still make a profit because the taxpayers have spent $23 billion subsidizing wealthy people so they can build windmills. these aren't your grandma's windmills. you can see them for 20 miles away--the flashing lights. they are twice as tall as the football stadium at the university of tennessee, and only one of these would fit within the football stadium at the university of tennessee. it would take four nuclear reactors, each taking about 1 square mile, to produce enough electricity to equal the same amount of electricity produced by wind if you strung 45-foot windmill towers along the entire 2,178-mile stretch of the appalachian trail. you may say that is a stretch, that will not happen, except that is exactly where the wind towers would be most likely to go--on our scenic mountain tops where more wind blows, and then the transmission lines come down the mountain tops through your backyard. my objection is a very simple one. i think $23 billion is enough to spend on windmills. i have other objections to wind. i think we should focus on nuclear power instead of unreliable wind power. i believe trying to use wind turbines to power a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world is the energy equivalent of going to war in sailboats when the nuclear navy is available, but i certainly think there is no need at all for senators to say yes to an amendment that spends more money for wind than our subcommittee recommended. we are already spending $23 billion. the taxpayers have been bamboozled into allowing that to happen, and i don't think they would want us to spend more. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from arizona. mr. flake. mr. president, i rise to speak in support of flake amendment no. 3820, which would lower the construction appropriation for the u.s. corps of engineers by just under $69 million and eliminate funding for environmental infrastructure projects. ostensibly, the corps of engineers uses these funds to build water supply, water treatment, and wastewater projects. i am not here to argue against the need for environmental infrastructure projects. there are a great many municipalities that consider these projects essential and have made an effort to fund them on their own. that is usually done through a combination of utility bills and municipal bonds. typically, the users pay for this. however, despite the fact that these projects have traditionally been funded by state and local governments, federal support is actually duplicative. the federal government already offers resources for similar projects through the epa. specifically, the clean water state revolving fund and the drinking water state revolving fund programs provide states with low-interest loans based on the merits of these projects and the needs of the communities. taxpayers deserve better than to be expected to provide the u.s. corps of engineers $69 million it never asked for to fund projects they already support in a program that has been described by many as a slush fund for parochial interests. that is certainly how the program started years ago. frankly, it has never seemed clear that the corps of engineers understands how these projects fit into its mission. because of a years-old congressional carve-out, these environmental undertakings are not subject to the environmental studies, economic analyses, and cost-effectiveness standards that are required for more traditional corps projects. as far as i can tell, there is really no rhyme or reason as to how one project gets funding over another. with a national debt of over $19 trillion, it is time that we get a little more serious about putting our fiscal house in order. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and eliminate this duplicative funding. mr. president, i wish to say a couple words about reid-heller amendment no. 3805. i support the colorado river system conservation program. voluntary efforts like these in arizona are estimated to have kept lake mead at about 3 feet higher than it would have been otherwise. not coincidentally, last week the bureau of reclamation announced that at the end of this year, lake mead is predicted to be 3 feet above the level that would trigger a shortage declaration. what i want to make sure happens is that any conserved water actually stays in lake mead and keeps these levels up above the shortage declaration area. i note that this amendment simply authorizes funds to go to the conservation program. i hope that before this money is actually spent, we can develop assurances that the water will go to its intended purpose. the lower colorado river basin states have developed such language, and i look forward to ensuring that our federal dollars are well spent in this area. amendment no. 3820 to amendment no. 3801 mr. president, i call up my amendment no. 3820 and ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number. the presiding officer. without objection, the clerk will report the amendment by number. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from arizona [mr. flake] proposes an amendment numbered 3820 to amendment no. 3801. the amendment is as follows: (purpose: to withhold certain funds for the construction of environmental infrastructure) on page 3, line 11, strike ``$1,813,649,000'' and insert ``$1,744,699,000''. mr. flake. i yield the remainder of my time. the presiding officer. the senator from oregon. amendment no. 3812 to amendment no. 3801 (purpose: to provide for funding for wind energy) mr. merkley. mr. president, i call up my amendment no. 3812. the presiding officer. the clerk will report. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from oregon [mr. merkley] proposes an amendment numbered 3812 to amendment no. 3801. on page 23, line 15, strike the period at the end and insert the following: ``: provided further, that of such amount, $95,400,000 shall be available for wind energy.''. mr. merkley. mr. president, i wish to add a few remarks about this, as we are preparing shortly to consider a number of amendments. this particular amendment is a bipartisan amendment, which i am pleased to sponsor with my partner from iowa, stating that wind energy is particularly important. this amendment would restore funding for wind energy research to fiscal year 2016 levels of $95.4 million. otherwise, research in wind energy would suffer a substantial reduction. this program is indispensable to the success of wind energy in the united states. the wind energy program works to advance innovations in the grid integration, manufacturing, and deployment that are key to reducing the cost of wind energy. for example, the wind program helps to address market barriers through including wind-forecasting tools in power system operations, which helps utilities and regulators better integrate large amounts of wind energy into the grid. [[page s2430]] the wind program provides research, development, and technical support to manufacturers and distributors of wind technologies that are still emerging. this enhances small wind manufacturing, supports offshore demonstration projects, and will improve the economic viability of distributed wind. currently, eight national laboratories across our nation conduct research or testing related to wind energy. the proposed fiscal year 2017 funding level is only $80 million, which is over $15 million less than last year's funding--thwarting our ability to realize the true potential for wind energy. during debates, we have sometimes heard that wind is a mature industry and that is why the funding for research should be revoked or lowered. but in fact, as wind is emerging, we are seeing continuous innovations resulting in different designs and different strategies for integrating intermittent wind energy into the grid. as that wind component becomes substantially larger, we need to understand the details of how we accommodate it effectively. if we were to talk about mature industries, then we wouldn't be doing studies for the fossil fuel industry, which is about as mature as an industry can get. clearly, this is an evolving industry with great potential to assist us with clean energy and, moreover, a program that can affect the economy of rural america. in 2015 wind energy supplied about 5 percent of the total electricity generated in the united states. so it is no longer just a fraction of a percent; it has grown enormously in the last few years. but the department of energy estimates that wind could provide as much as 35 percent--or more than one-third--of the electricity generated in our country by the year 2050. as my colleague and partner on this bill, the senator from iowa, knows, wind energy can be a huge boon to a state's economy. iowa is already getting over 30 percent of its electricity from wind. and because wind energy is less expensive in the forecast of potential other sources, it could result in billions of dollars of savings to energy consumers in that state. in my home state of oregon, we already have over 10 percent of our electricity being generated from wind energy. the savings for our state down the road could be enormous, but we can only reach these goals if we support wind energy research. with the development of wind energy comes hundreds of thousands of jobs in manufacturing, in installation, in maintenance, and in supporting services. the estimate is around 600,000 jobs--generally good-paying jobs--by the year 2015. i do a lot of townhalls back home in oregon, one in every county every year. much of oregon is very rural. i hear about the impact property taxes on these wind installations have on our rural counties, enabling them to do things--for example, to build libraries or assist in the development of their local schools. there is no question that this is a boon to the rural economy. it is our job in congress to look at what policies will be the most successful and give the most bang for the buck in terms of creating jobs now and in the future. we should be supporting programs that spur economic development and support families in rural areas. that is what this amendment calls for. when we create jobs, local communities benefit, certainly the energy industry benefits, and our environment benefits. all of this depends upon robust research, and we are simply asking that research continue at the same level it did in fiscal year 2016. let's back red, white, and blue, american-made wind energy and support this bipartisan amendment. i urge my colleagues to support it. i yield the floor. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. merkley. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. flake). without objection, it is so ordered. there are now 2 minutes equally divided on amendment no. 3812. the senator from oregon. mr. merkley. mr. president, we will be voting on amendment no. 3812, which my colleague from iowa and i have put together to restore research on wind development to the level it was last year. when you see these wind turbines, what you should see is economic development in highly deserving rural communities, putting clean electrons onto the grid, putting jobs into the community, and putting money into the property tax coffers in local communities to do good work. i wish to reserve the rest of my time. the presiding officer. who yields time? does the senator from tennessee wish to use his time on the amendment? mr. alexander. i do, but i will wait until the end. the presiding officer. if no one uses time, time will be charged equally to both sides. mr. alexander. mr. president, can i not reserve the rest of my time? the presiding officer. not at this point. mr. alexander. mr. president, don't you think $23 billion is enough to spend on windmills? that is what we have spent since 1992--$23 billion for 4 percent of america's electricity. this is electricity that is unreliable. the windmills blow about one-third of the time, often at night, and it can't be stored. we will spend $5 billion this year and $4.4 billion next year. we could double our energy research spending if we would stop subsidizing wealthy people to build giant wind turbines. sixty percent of our carbon-free electricity comes from nuclear reactors. relying on giant wind turbines and new transmission lines to power a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world is like going to war in sailboats when the nuclear navy is available. we already have $80 million going to research, which senator gardner and senator collins have asked us to include in the legislation. it is in the bill. we don't need to spend more. we have already spent $23 billion since 1992. spending $4 or $5 billion a year is more than enough to spend on giant wind turbines. i urge a ``no'' vote on the merkley amendment. the presiding officer. the senator from oregon. mr. merkley. mr. president, these subsidies are a tiny dot compared to the $52 billion spent annually on fossil fuel subsidies and the massive subsidies spent on nuclear. yet these subsidies are creating jobs in rural america, and that matters. these communities need these jobs. these are clean electrons, these are terrific middle-class jobs, and this is an industry that is still on a curve where research is truly beneficial in making it a success. the presiding officer. the senator's time has expired. the question is on agreeing to the amendment. mr. alexander. mr. president, i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second?

the majority leader. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, reserving the right to object, i understand our democratic friends are going to propound a number of different unanimous consent requests here with regard, i assume, to the judiciary. the core question here is whether president obama has been treated fairly, and i think it is noteworthy that at this point in president bush's 8 years, 303 of his judicial nominees had been confirmed. at this point in president obama's term, the number is 324. that is 21 more judges the current president has gotten at this point than president bush. clearly, president obama has been treated fairly and, therefore, i object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. the senator from hawaii. ms. hirono. mr. president, i am very disappointed the republicans are blocking dozens of qualified nominees--nominees who have been reported to the senate floor on a bipartisan basis. this is certainly, in my view, not about whether the president is being treated fairly, but it is about the senate doing its job. the senate is on track to confirm the lowest number of judicial nominees in our history. let me mention a nominee from hawaii: clare connors. she was confirmed or voted on unanimously by the judiciary committee last month, a statement to her qualifications. her wide-ranging experience includes district and appellate venues, criminal and civil arenas, and litigation on issues ranging from tax law to tough cases such as crimes against children. clare and the other nominees before us today will be kept from serving on the federal bench because of republican inaction. my republican colleagues intend to stop all judicial nominations in july, although there are 79 vacancies pending, 28 of which are considered emergencies. if ms. connors is not confirmed, the hawaii district court seat will be left vacant for over a year. our judiciary should be composed of the full complement of judges accorded to each district court. one of the fundamental jobs of the senate to engage in is its advice and consent function with regard to these judicial nominees, and we are not doing that. i call upon my colleagues, my republican friends, to enable all of us to do our jobs and begin again the advice and consent process which we are, under the constitution, required to do. i see some other colleagues on the floor, so i yield to my good friend from new york. the presiding officer. the senator from new york. unanimous consent request--executive calendar mr. schumer. mr. president, i will have a unanimous consent request after i make a few brief remarks. i thank my friends, the senators from hawaii and maryland, for joining me here today. we all know it is the job of the senate to keep up with the need to confirm judges, but our friends on the other side of the aisle aren't holding up their end of the bargain. the judicial confirmation process has been at a crawl for years. now it has come to a functional standstill, as noncontroversial nominations--some of which were approved out of committee by overwhelming votes, the majority of republicans and the majority of democrats--languish on the executive calendar. our colleagues on the other side of the aisle did their best to slow the pace of confirmations when the senate was under democratic leadership, and now they are sluggishly moving nominations under a senate they control. that has culminated in an irresponsible partisan blockade of president obama's supreme court pick. let's talk about some real numbers. more than 1 year into this new congress, the republican leadership has allowed only 17 judges to be confirmed. how many months do we have here? we had 12 in the last year of this congress, and we are now at the end of april, so that is 4. so that is 16--1 a month. let me show the contrast. i say to my dear friend, our majority leader, this is the number that counts because the analogy was the last 2 years of the bush administration when there was a democratic majority. then, a republican president and a democratic majority; now, a democratic president and a republican majority. they confirmed 17 and we confirmed 68. this has consequences--real consequences. the number of vacancies has risen from 43 to 79 since the republicans took over the majority. that didn't happen when president bush was president and made nominations. twenty-eight judicial emergencies. for people seeking justice--they can't get it very speedily because of the obstruction of judges. there are 20 noncontroversial judges on the executive calendar. we are urging our colleagues to let these noncontroversial judges go through. very simply, we are urging our colleagues to do their job. i know the leader wants to have the senate move along, and we have tried to go along whenever it is possible. but this is a glaring example where it is easy to do your job, where it is easy to move things forward, and all we face is obstruction and for no voiced reason. i would like to know why the judges who i will ask for unanimous consent--it is a smaller list than my colleague from hawaii has asked to go forward with. i would love to know a single reason why any of them shouldn't be sitting on the bench. i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: calendar nos. 307, 357, 358, 359, 362, and 363; further, that the senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations; that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table. the presiding officer. is there objection? the majority leader. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, reserving the right to object, i would say to my democratic friends that no effort to redefine what this is about will be successful. the issue before the senate is, has president obama been treated fairly with regard to the confirmation of judges during his tenure in office? we are to a point where we know that so far during the obama years, he has gotten 23 more judges than president bush got to this point. that is the fundamental question. has president obama been treated in some way differently from president bush? the answer, of course, is no. therefore, i object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. the senator from maryland. unanimous consent requests--executive calendar mr. cardin. mr. president, i will continue to try here, and i thank the senate majority leader for his patience. this is really not a matter of fairness to the president but fairness to the [[page s2433]] american people. as my colleague senator hirono pointed out, this is a matter of justice delayed is justice denied. we have judicial emergencies--many on our list--that have not been filled. as senator schumer pointed out, this is about comparing what has been done on the workload of this congress to any previous congress on the confirmation of judges, and we are dead last as far as action that has been taken. i think the critical number is the number of vacancies. compare the number of vacancies. when the republicans took the majority, there were 43 vacancies in our courts. that number has almost doubled to 79 vacancies. when we take a look at the pace of confirmation--because we could say maybe there were a lot that had to be taken up over a president's term. but, as senator schumer pointed out, there have been only 17 judges confirmed to date. that is one of the lowest numbers in the modern history of our country. in the last year of president bush's administration, in the same period of time of that 2-year cycle, 68 judges had been confirmed by a democratically controlled senate. what makes matters more difficult for the american people to understand is that 20 judicial nominations have currently passed the senate judiciary committee. i believe every one has been passed by unanimous voice vote, so they are not controversial. it is just a matter of getting them up for confirmation--20 of them that have yet to be acted on the floor of the senate. i will make two unanimous consent requests that will deal with 4 of these 20 currently pending. all passed the judiciary committee by unanimous voice votes. two are from states that have democratic senators and two are from states that have republican senators. i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: calendar no. 307, xinis of maryland; calendar no. 357, martinotti of new jersey; calendar no. 358, rossiter of nebraska; and calendar no. 359, stanton of tennessee; that the senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the record; that the president be immediately notified of the senate's action, and the senate then resume legislative session. the presiding officer. is there objection? the senator from texas. mr. cornyn. mr. president, for the reasons previously expressed by the majority leader, i object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. the senator from maryland. mr. cardin. mr. president, i want to make one further request in the series with senator hirono and senator schumer, and that is to deal with the next nominee who would be up, considering the length of time she has been on the calendar. it is the nomination of paula xinis of maryland made in march 2015--over 1 year ago--by president obama. she was recommended by senator mikulski and me after an exhaustive vetting process that we go through before making recommendations to the president of the united states. she was nominated over 1 year ago. she had a hearing in the judiciary committee in july of 2015. as i said earlier, she was reported out of the committee by unanimous voice vote in september of last year, and she has been waiting all this time for action on the senate floor. we need this vacancy filled. we now have two vacancies in the maryland district. the chief judge has related to us several times that this position is critical for the administration of justice for the people of maryland and our nation. therefore, i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: calendar no. 307, xinis of maryland; that the senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nomination; that any related statements be printed in the record; that the president be immediately notified of the senate's action, and the senate then resume legislative session. the presiding officer. is there objection? the senator from texas. mr. cornyn. mr. president, for reasons previously given, i object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. the senator from wyoming. mr. enzi. mr. president, i wish to inject a few comments in this discussion too. this isn't all about republicans. this isn't all about democrats. i had a nominee from wyoming. incidentally, he wasn't nominated by me; he was nominated by our democratic governor. it took me about 9 months to get a hearing in committee. this was for a district judge. this wasn't for the supreme court. this wasn't for a circuit court. this was for a district court. it took me about 9 months to get a hearing for him. at the end of 2 years, he had not gotten a vote in committee. his life was in suspense for 2 years. that is not right. neither party should do that. but as long as the other side is saying that we are holding things up, i have to point out that it is not just a one-sided thing. i hope some of the criticism can end and some of the work can be done. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from maryland. mr. cardin. mr. president, i just want to share in the frustration of my colleague from wyoming. this should not be a partisan issue. i agree, it is wrong to hold people's lives in abeyance. we are trying to get the very best people to serve on our courts. if they have to put their lives on hold for a year or two, will they come forward and seek to serve as a judge? we know that for the ones we are trying to get on the bench, it is going to be a financial sacrifice. they can make more money in the private sector. we want the very best on our courts. if someone is put on hold for 2 years or for 1 year, it compromises their ability if they are in the private practice of law, and it is not the right thing to do--whether it is a democrat or a republican in the white house. we have to act on these appointments a lot faster. the point i raised is that during this term of congress, during this year and a half, we have seen the number of judicial vacancies go up from 43 to 79. at this particular moment, there are 20 nominees on the executive calendar who have cleared the committee by voice vote and who are not controversial. some have been waiting over a year since their nomination. we can do something about it right now, and we should do something about it right now. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from hawaii. ms. hirono. mr. president, i wish to say a few more things regarding our request for action on these judicial nominations. the group of nominations on which i requested action includes nominees from maryland, new jersey, nebraska, tennessee, new york, california, rhode island, pennsylvania, and hawaii. they are all waiting. i have just one comment about the supreme court vacancy. the last time the senate refused to deal with a supreme court vacancy was during the civil war. they so objected to dealing with the president's nomination that the congress actually changed the number of justices on the supreme court. the number of justices is set by law, so the congress changed the law and changed the number of justices from 10 to 7 so that they would not have to deal with the president's nominee to the supreme court vacancy. the president vetoed that bill, the congress overrode that veto, and so they changed the makeup and number of justices on the supreme court. certainly that is not what i am suggesting republicans should do. in fact, we have had a nine-member supreme court for almost 150 years. i agree with my friend, the senator from wyoming, that this should not be a partisan issue. certainly, i agree with my friend from maryland that we should get on with it. we should get on with these judicial nominations. we should do our advice and consent role, and clearly with regard to the supreme court vacancy, where, with this inaction, we are going to leave that court [[page s2434]] with eight members for a year. that is not acceptable to the people of our country. we need to do our job. i ask my senate colleagues, my republican friends, to enable the senate to do our advice and consent role and do our job as set forth in the u.s. constitution. i yield the floor. ____________________",54523

The Senator from Colorado. Nomination of Merrick Garland Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the vacancy on the Supreme Court and the majority's ongoing refusal to consider the nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland. Forty days have passed since the President of the United States nominated Judge Garland to fill Justice Scalia's seat. This is longer than it took for the Senate to confirm Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981. In fact, 75 percent of all Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed within 31 days, but today-- 40 days after his nomination--many Senators haven't even extended Judge Garland the simple courtesy of a meeting. The majority's refusal to hold a vote is without precedent, and the majority has cited none. Instead, the majority is trying to shift the blame. Incredibly, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee recently came to the floor to blame, of all people, not other Senators, not other politicians, but the Chief Justice of the United States of America for politicizing the Court. Ten days before Justice Scalia's death, the Chief Justice said: ``The process is not functioning very well.'' That turns out to have been something of an understatement. The Chief Justice went on and said that the process ``is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees.'' Again, he was not referring to what is going on now in the Senate. This happened before Justice Scalia passed away. There was no way that the Chief Justice could have known there was going to be a vacancy. He continued: ``[Supreme Court Justices] don't work as Democrats or Republicans . . . and I think it's a very unfortunate impression the public might get from the confirmation process.'' His words struck me--particularly given what has gone on since then-- as a candid expression of his concern for the Court as an institution. This concern apparently upset the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He took to the floor and said: The Chief Justice has it exactly backwards. The confirmation process doesn't make the Justices appear political. He continued: The confirmation process has gotten political precisely because the Court has drifted from the constitutional text, and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences. It is absolutely breathtaking that the Chief Justice would be criticized for ``drifting from the constitutional text'' when, for the past 10 weeks, the majority has drifted from article II, section 2, clause 2, which sets out our constitutional responsibility to advise and consent in very clear terms. Worse, the majority's drift isn't even about policy; it is about politics. It is about rolling the dice on an election instead of following the plain text of the Constitution. This is absolutely unprecedented in the history of the Senate. Throughout our history, the Senate has confirmed 17 nominees in Presidential election years to serve on the Supreme Court. The last of these was Justice Kennedy in 1988. When the President made this nomination, he had more than 340 days left in his term. We are talking almost a quarter of the President's term. That is a lot more time than most of those 17 Justices had before this Senate. In the last 100 years, every nominee to a Supreme Court vacancy who did not withdraw--and a couple did--received a timely hearing and vote. On average, the Senate has begun hearings within 40 days of the President's nomination and voted to confirm 70 days after the President's nomination. There is no excuse for not holding a hearing and a vote. If that is what we are going to pay attention to in this Chamber and if that is what we are going to argue for--originalism, strict constructionism--the plain language of the Constitution is clear. There is a reason why no Senate has ever had the audacity to do what this Senate is doing right now--because of how clear that mission is and because there is no one else to do it. The Constitution says: The Senate shall advise and consent. It doesn't say: The House of Representatives shall have a role. It doesn't say: Let the people decide. It says that this is the Senate's job. We should do our job just as every Senate, until now, has done its job since the founding of the country, including the Senate that was there when George Washington was in office. Three of those 17 appointments were confirmed by a Senate that actually contained people who had been at the constitutional convention, and they were consistent with their understanding of what the Founders had agreed to. They had a vote on the floor of the Senate. I am not saying how people should vote. They should vote their conscience, but we should have a vote. The American people expect us to do our job. I want to be clear that I believe there should be hearings. I think we should go through hearings to establish the qualifications of the nominee. I think that is really important. The point I am making about having this vote does not have to do with whom the President nominated. It has to do with our institutional responsibility. It has to do with the rule of law and the image we want to project to our country and overseas. Finally, I have a word to say about the President's nominee. Merrick Garland is an honored and accomplished judge. Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet with him and learn about his judicial record and philosophy. I have known Chief Judge Garland for more than 20 years. I have actually worked for him at the Justice Department when we both worked for the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. I was fresh out of law school, but even then Judge Garland's humility, work ethic, and commitment to the rule of law inspired me and continue to inspire me. Our meeting last week confirmed what I already know. Judge Garland is an intelligent and pragmatic judge who is extraordinarily well- qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. I have wondered whether that is the reason the majority is not holding hearings. They could simply hold the hearings and vote against Judge Garland, which is their prerogative. Why not hold hearings? Maybe they know that the American people, given the opportunity to hear directly from Judge Garland, would see that he is precisely the type of judge who should serve on the Court. A vacancy on the Supreme Court is a rare thing. It doesn't come around very often. For those of us in this country, whether we are in the Senate or in a classroom somewhere, those vacancies, hearings, and debates on the floor present an unparalleled opportunity--a remarkable opportunity--for the American people to engage in a debate about the Court, the Constitution, and all kinds of issues that the Court will consider. That is what these hearings are about. That is what could be going on this summer during this Presidential election year, and we would have a discussion about where we want to head as a country. We are not having it. We are not having it because of this unprecedented action. Because of what the majority has done here, by not meeting with the nominee or holding a hearing, they are denying him the opportunity to make his case to the American people. In the meantime--and this is really critical--the Court will continue to be impaired. Impaired is the word that Justice Scalia himself used when he was asked to recuse himself from a case involving Dick Cheney, then the Vice President of the United States. In that case, he was asked if there would be a presumption of recusal. Justice Scalia's answer [[Page S2435]] to that was this: Maybe if I were on the court of appeals--because if I were on the court of appeals, there would be somebody to replace me, but that is not how it works on the Supreme Court. When there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, leaving the Court with only eight Justices, there is nobody who can fill in. There is nobody to become the ninth Justice. He said that the Court would therefore be impaired. The action that is being taken right now threatens to impair the Supreme Court not for one session but for two sessions of the Court before there is another election. In fact, for the third time since Justice Scalia's death, the Supreme Court could not resolve a dispute because of a 4-to-4 split. The longer this vacancy remains, the more uncertainty and confusion the American people will suffer. As I said, two terms of the Court will be jeopardized by petty politics. Believe me, I know it has become fashionable for Washington to tear down rather than work to improve the democratic institutions that generations of Americans have built, but to so cavalierly impair the judicial branch of our government is pathetic. It is time for the Senate to do its job as every Senate has done before us. Again, I am not asking my colleagues to support Judge Garland's nomination. That is a matter of conscience for each of us. But we must fulfill our basic constitutional obligation of holding a hearing and a vote. This is literally--because it is in the Constitution and no one else is granted this power--the least we can do to demonstrate that we are a legislative body that functions as the Constitution requires. We certainly have plenty of time. In view of that, if by contrast we leave for our scheduled 7 weeks of summer vacation--which is not enshrined in the Constitution but is a schedule that is set by the Senate--without having fulfilled our responsibility, the American people should demand that we return to Washington and do our job. It is past time for my colleagues to meet with Judge Garland, hold hearings on his record, and give the American people an up-or-down vote on this judicial vacancy. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority whip. The Appropriations Process Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I fear that sometimes here in the Senate we get bogged down in the minutia and the process and don't really talk about the why of how things are done here. We talk a lot about the how, but we don't talk about the why. I just want to speak for a couple of minutes about why it is so important that we pass the regular appropriation bills and put what we are trying to do here in a larger context. Our colleagues will remember that last year we were unable to pass the 12 regular appropriation bills because our Democratic colleagues filibustered those pieces of legislation in order to force a negotiation to raise the spending caps on discretionary spending. I regret that. I wish it hadn't happened, but it did and there is not much we can do about it. But in the process, what happened is that we ended up having to pass a fiscal year-end omnibus appropriations bill that lacked any basic transparency. There was about $1 trillion-plus worth of spending, and I think most people's reaction is this: Why do you have to do business in such a terrible way that lacks transparency, doesn't let people know what is in the bill, and doesn't let all 100 Senators contribute to the product? The reason is because our Democratic colleagues blocked those bills. I hope it is different this year because now those top-line numbers for discretionary spending are fixed in law. What we are trying to do, starting with the Energy and Water appropriations bill that Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein are working through the legislative process, is to begin the process of passing those regular appropriation bills. I hope and trust we will conclude with this piece of legislation this week and then we will move on to the next legislative vehicle, which will probably be the transportation, housing, and urban development legislation, the so-called THUD bill around here. We have actually demonstrated that by providing an open process, we can actually get some things done. We all recall last Congress--a year and a half ago. The fact of the matter is that a decision had been made by the then-majority leader, Senator Reid, not to allow Senators to participate in the amendment process on the floor. As a consequence, it wasn't just those of us in the minority who were prohibited from offering legislation that would actually improve the product that was on the floor, it included Members of his own political party. So they had to go home at election time and explain to their constituents back home: I may be in the majority, but I couldn't get an amendment voted on, on the Senate floor. Having learned from that experience, Senator McConnell and we decided that the best thing to do is to have an open process by which Members of the majority party and minority party, Democrats and Republicans alike--anybody who has a good idea--can come forward and get a vote on that legislation. We had a couple of recent bipartisan successes. Yes, I know in some corners ``bipartisanship'' is a dirty word, but the fact is, you can't get anything done around here unless it is bipartisan. Our Constitution was written in a way to force consensus to be built. In an absence of consensus, nothing gets done. So we have had a couple of recent successes, in addition to our work on appropriations bills, including the Energy Policy Modernization Act. One of the most important parts of that legislation from my perspective is that back in Texas we saw an expedited process for the approval of liquefied natural gas export terminals. That is very important to our economy and something that takes advantage of an incredible resource we have in America--natural gas--which we would like to sell to our allies and friends around the world when they don't have it. That is something that builds jobs in America. It helps grow our economy. It helps provide a lifeline to many of our allies around the world, for whom energy is being used simply as a weapon by people like Vladimir Putin. We also voted to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration bill. Obviously, this is important for public safety--to make sure our skies are safe--but also to provide the appropriate regulatory regime for the airline industry. Looked at individually, these bills may not seem like an end-all or be-all, but they are part of a bigger picture and part of a larger goal, which is getting this legislative body back to work again, as it was meant to do, considering and passing legislation that will impact our country for the better. Don't get me wrong. Sometimes the right answer is to stop bad ideas. Sometimes the right idea is to stop bad ideas, but where there is an opportunity for consensus and where we can actually craft something that helps move our country forward--I believe all 100 Senators came here with that sort of goal in mind. The bottom line is, we are working again to advance the priorities of the American people. In the same way we debate and discuss the Energy and Water appropriations bill, we have to keep the bigger picture in mind. It is not just about passing a single appropriations bill or to check items off our to-do list, it is part of a larger process, which is to fund the Federal Government in a fiscally responsible way, hopefully--that is our goal--and to make sure we review the programs that are funded by Federal appropriations and make sure they are still the priorities we believe they should be. If they aren't, then they shouldn't be funded. That is part of the process--to go back and look at what the programs are, whether they are still working, whether they are still necessary, and if they are not working or no longer necessary, then we simply no longer fund those as part of the appropriations process. We know this sets our country's priorities by giving guidance on everything we support--from our veterans to how we provide for our energy structure needs, to how we equip and train our troops. Funding the government is actually one of the most important and basic duties of the Congress. As the Senator from Tennessee has pointed out, one of the biggest problems we have--one we are not going to solve here today or this week, unfortunately--is that so much of the money [[Page S2436]] that gets spent by the Federal Government is on autopilot--so-called mandatory spending. In other words, it is not even subject to the appropriations process in the Senate. Currently, only about one-third of the money the Federal Government spends actually goes through this sort of transparent and open process, where everybody knows what is going on and can offer their input. The rest of the money is spent on autopilot, and it is projected to rise, according to one recent projection I saw, at a rate of roughly 5.3 percent over the next 30 years. We know that is far beyond the rate of inflation, and it is an unsustainable amount of spending. Some of the most important programs that are government funded, such as Medicare or Social Security, cannot be sustained at the current level of spending unless we do everything we can within our ability to shore them up and save them for the next generation. That is what we actually need to be doing in the larger picture. Until that day, we can continue to do what we can to deal responsibly with discretionary spending, and that is what we are trying to do. If we don't deal with these appropriations bills in a methodical and deliberate sort of way--all 12 of them--we are going to find ourselves at the end of September, at the end of the fiscal year, back in the same situation we were in last year--with the need for an omnibus appropriations bill or a continuing resolution, which is something I know there is not a lot of appetite for. Zika Virus Mr. President, let me just say a word about the Zika virus and the emergency funding request made by the President. Some of our colleagues--notably the Democratic leader and the Democratic whip-- talked about this this morning and raised the question of whether we are going to responsibly deal with this threat of the Zika virus. I can tell my colleagues we will. We are committed on a bipartisan basis to try to make sure we respond responsibly both from a public safety point of view and from a fiscal point of view. The President requested $1.9 billion. Thankfully, there is money that has been identified that was left over from the Ebola threat--some $500 million--that can be used as a downpayment to make sure our world-class scientists, like the ones I have met at the University of Texas medical branch in Galveston and just this last week at the Texas Medical Center, are doing the research that is necessary in order to identify how to stop this threat by controlling the mosquitoes that bring it into the country. We know the mosquito that carries the Zika virus is common in more temperate and warmer parts of the country, and that is why it has been primarily a threat in Brazil and places like Haiti and Puerto Rico. We also know that in places like Texas, Florida, and Louisiana, this mosquito is present and there are already established cases of Zika, primarily occurring in, I believe, either people who have traveled to Central America or South America and who have been bitten and brought it back with them or, in the case of--apparently it has now been discovered that this virus can be sexually transmitted. So one of the things we need to make sure of, particularly for every woman of child-bearing age, is that they get the sort of protection they need so these horrific birth defects that we have seen in the news don't occur. We are all committed to doing that. We also ought to make sure we don't overshoot our goal and write a blank check for something when we don't even know what the plan of attack is. In some ways, this is like the President asking us to fund a war without telling us what his strategy is for fighting and winning that war. I think that is the sort of commonsense question our constituents want us to ask, and which we should ask. I realize not everything is knowable. Hopefully, within a couple of years, our scientific community will have developed a vaccine which can protect people from this virus, but in the meantime we need to continue to fund the basic research. We need to continue to fund at the local level the mosquito eradication, and we need to keep our eye on this emerging threat. We can do that, and we will do that in a responsible sort of way. We don't need our colleagues on the Democratic side to say we have to do it right here, right now, without even having a plan from the administration on how we will fight and win this war against the Zika virus and hold up the regular appropriations process. I can tell from the saber-rattling going on from some of my colleagues across the aisle that they are looking for a reason to disrupt the regular appropriations process and that can be a mistake. First of all, it will not accomplish anything that can't otherwise be accomplished in terms of funding our research and the fight against the Zika virus. We are committed to doing that in a bipartisan sort of way but in a responsible sort of way that doesn't add to the national debt and pass the bill on to the next generation, as well as a proportional response to the threat. Just throwing money at it without a plan does not seem like a responsible thing to do. I implore our colleagues across the aisle, do not try to use the Zika crisis to hold hostage our ability to do our regular appropriations work. It is too important to avoid the year-end Omnibus appropriations bill that nobody says they like, and it is important for us to demonstrate--as we have tried to and I believe succeeded in doing, in large part--that we can continue to do our work day in and day out on a bipartisan, responsible basis, not that we are all going to agree on everything--that is just not the way people are built--nor do they want us to agree on everything. This is the place where we have the great debates on the issues that confront our country, both now and in the future, and that is appropriate. Nobody should take it personally. We need to have those debates. We need to have those verbal confrontations so we can get to the truth and figure the best path forward for the country. So we are not here to kick the can down the road. We are here to do the Nation's business, and we are here to deliver results to the American people. I hope we can continue to do that by carefully discussing, debating, and then voting on all 12 appropriations bills. In addition to talking about how, I hope to explain a little bit of the why it is so important that we do this now in order to avoid that year-end rush to an omnibus appropriations bill later on. Mr. President, I don't see any other Senators seeking recognition, so I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first, to the majority whip, I thank him for his comments on the Zika virus. He is absolutely right to raise awareness of that issue. It is a great concern. In Ohio we happen to have some military assets that have been used in the past for aerial spraying, and I know they are interested in being even more involved in some of the eradication of some of these mosquitoes in the southern part of the country that may end up causing some of this infection. It is a very serious matter, and I am glad to know the Appropriations Committee is working on it as well as our authorizing committees. I know the Senator from Texas has a personal interest in this. I rise to speak about the underlying legislation--the Energy and Water appropriations bill. I thank the chairman of that committee, Senator Alexander, for working with me to include a couple of important provisions for the State of Ohio. One is the cleanup of what is known as the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant. This is a site that for half a century enriched uranium. This uranium was used by our Navy, for our military, and for other purposes, including our nuclear arsenals, but it also has been used for our powerplants. So for decades the people in Piketon, OH, have been helping keep Americans safe and also helping thousands of Ohioans to keep the lights on and to stay warm at a reasonable cost. Now we have to clean up this facility. We moved on to other technology. It is an efficient [[Page S2437]] technology, but it is a heck of a cleanup removing all this gaseous diffusion material and properly disposing of it. This cleanup effort employs about 2,000 Ohioans. They are doing their job and doing it very well. We have to support them. Unfortunately, over the years they have not gotten the support they deserve. In a 2008 campaign trip to Ohio, the President gave a commitment that he would accelerate that cleanup. Frankly, that just hasn't happened under the President's budget, so every year we have to fight for more funding to be sure that we can continue the cleanup, which is so important, but also to ensure that we aren't losing jobs in Pike County. We just had this tragic occurrence where we had four different homes where family members were present during the horrible shooting out there in Pike County. This is one of the counties in Ohio that have relatively high unemployment. It is a county that has a lot of economic issues. These 2,000 jobs are good-paying jobs with good benefits, so it is very important that we keep the jobs there. Just as importantly, it is the right thing to do for the taxpayers because as the Obama administration has pulled back funding for this cleanup, it ends up costing the taxpayers more because delaying this cleanup ends up adding huge additional costs as funding is cut back and there is less cleanup going on. Our analysis shows that an accelerated cleanup could save the taxpayers $4 billion, getting this done and moving the site on to commercial use. Having adequate funding will save the taxpayers money. Second, cleaning up the radioactive waste and other hazardous waste there is incredibly important for the community. It makes that site cleaner, of course, and is better for the environment. It is important for the community and these people who have for many years been providing us with the enriched uranium for our military and for our powerplants to know they are not going to be left with this environmental problem. Third, these are good-paying jobs in a county that really needs them. Finally, we owe it to the community to clean up the site so they can redevelop it. They want to reindustrialize this site, and it is a great location to do maybe an energy project or maybe a nuclear powerplant at some point and other exciting opportunities, but they have to clean up what is there in order for the site to be used for that. The people of Piketon have helped shore up our economy and our national defense. We owe it to them to clean up this site. I am pleased that in this legislation we are considering an increase of $20 million over this year's level of cleanup work and an additional $20 million over this year's level for constructing a needed onsite disposal cell. We are at the point where we need to dispose of this material, and we need more money for that disposal cell. I am hoping that the House will increase the funding for the disposal cell even more, and if so, we will work in conference to get that number up further because that makes a lot of sense in order to actually move forward on this cleanup for all the reasons I have stated. Again, I thank the chairman, Senator Alexander, for his help on this. One thing the chairman knows well is that part of the funding for the cleanup work comes from the Department of Energy's barter of uranium. I ask that as we move forward with the completion of this legislation over the next few months, if the price of uranium should change--should drop--that the chairman continue to work with us to ensure that there are no job losses and to ensure that the cleanup work is not delayed as it has been in the past. Second, I thank the chairman for including another provision that is incredibly important to Ohio and to Lake Erie. For many years the Army Corps of Engineers has been dredging the Cuyahoga River. It is necessary to do that for commercial purposes. They have a big steel plant there, which anybody who comes to the Republican Convention will see. It is very important, for that plant and other commercial purposes, to keep this waterway open for boat traffic, including bringing iron ore in for the steel mills. Unfortunately, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wants to take the dredge from the river and dump it into Lake Erie. Time and time again, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and others have said this is not good for the environment. Specifically, the dredge has PCB material. The PCB pollutants get into the fish, and the Ohio EPA has told them that if they keep dumping it into the lake, at some point they will have to issue a warning that the walleye in Lake Erie, which is our great game fish, is not to be eaten more than a certain number of times per month. This would kill the fishing industry. It is also the wrong thing to do with all the algal bloom problems we have in the lake because that is driven by nitrogen and phosphorous mostly, and those nutrients would get into the lake through this dumping. So we are saying: Let's use an onsite disposal facility. We have one on land that they can use. They are refusing to do that. The Army Corps of Engineers has gone so far as to, in the last appropriations bill, actually cut their own funding--which is something I have never seen before--to not be able to meet the requirement we put into law, saying that they have to provide for the disposal of this product not into the lake but onto a land facility. We have now worked with Chairman Alexander to include language in this legislation before us. Senator Sherrod Brown and I were successful in getting that in last year. Once again we are working with the chairman to get that language in this year. I thank Senator Alexander for including it. It maintains the requirement that ensures that the Corps uphold its funding obligations to dispose of this dredge material upland and not in the lake. Again, it concerns me that the Corps seems to want to try to get around this. In fact, instead of putting money into the operations and maintenance account, as they are required to do to comply with not just what Congress says but, frankly, what the court has ordered them to do--because the court has consistently said they have to dredge and then dump on land, they have actually put that into a risky position by saying they don't need the funding. They have gone so far as to indicate that maybe other dredging projects on Lake Erie or other Lake Erie funding could be in jeopardy of not receiving the full amount of money they need if there is a need to dispose of this on land. There is a better way. The Corps should request use of unallocated funds provided by Congress in order to dispose of the dredge material at Cleveland Harbor safely without putting other projects at risk. They can do that. Our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, is currently investigating whether the Corps intentionally requested a decrease in funding in last year's spending bill so that they would have no choice but to dump this dredge material into the harbor. I hope that is not true. I hope we find out that is not what happened, but there are indications of that. Again, doing so would threaten the health of the area, the city of Cleveland, Lake Erie's ecosystem, and specifically our fishing industry in Lake Erie, which is so critical to economic growth in that area. Lake Erie is the most productive of all of our Great Lakes in terms of fishing. It has a $6 billion fishing industry and is the No. 1 tourist attraction in Ohio. I urge the Corps to revise its work plan for this year to request the additional funds necessary to safely dispose of the dredge sediment at the Cleveland Harbor during the 2016 dredging season if, as I suspect, the Federal judge again rules that the Corps cannot place it in Lake Erie. I urge them to work with us to come up with a solution so we can have this dredge material disposed of on land and actually recycle that material so that it has value. A couple of weeks ago when I was at the site, I saw how some of the material is being mixed with other fill and being used not just for landfill but also for gardens and for farming and agriculture purposes. This is a way to take the dredge and to actually have it have value and be able to recycle it. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to give this statement today and for his patience. I also thank Chairman Alexander and others who have worked with us on this so that we can indeed be sure that we clean up this site and that we are able to get this dredge material coming out [[Page S2438]] of the Cuyahoga River onto a site on land to avoid the environmental damage that would otherwise occur. I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Mr. SCHATZ. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 17 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman). Without objection, it is so ordered. Zika Virus Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I first want to talk about the Zika public health emergency that is coming to the United States of America. We have to act now to fund the administration's request of $1.9 billion in supplemental funding. Zika is a disease carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector that has already caused a dengue epidemic in my State of Hawaii. The Aedes mosquitoes are in more places than we previously thought throughout the United States. Zika is the first mosquito-borne illness to be associated with a congenital birth defect. We are continuing to learn more about this devastating disease every day, including its association with Guillain- Barre syndrome--a type of paralysis--eye abnormalities, and more. While there have not yet been any locally transmitted diseases of Zika in the continental United States, we do have hundreds of travel- related cases and up to 500 cases of active transmission in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As I mentioned, Hawaii is recovering from a dengue epidemic. So we must provide emergency funding for mosquito-borne illnesses, and we must do it now. This is an emergency. The administration has clearly laid out its request to combat Zika, which includes the following: $830 million for the CDC. This money would include grants and technical assistance to Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories and help our domestic and international response activities; about $250 million for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to increase the Federal match rate to Puerto Rico; and several hundred million dollars for the National Institutes of Health and BARDA to invest in vaccine research and development. That is the long-term solution. There is a high degree of competence that we will be able to get a vaccine but not without the funding. This is an absolute emergency. We need $10 million for the FDA vaccine and diagnostics development and review, which is absolutely critical--we don't have diagnostic tests that are quite as efficient and effective as we are eventually going to need--and $335 million for USAID efforts abroad in public health infrastructure. I was fortunate to visit the CDC in Atlanta a couple of weeks ago to learn more about their efforts to combat Zika, dengue, and other vector-borne diseases. I saw firsthand how the CDC has activated its Level 1 Emergency Operations Center to combat Zika. During my questions at the Labor-HHS appropriations hearings, I heard how the CDC is strapped for funds and has already programmed its Ebola funds and how these Ebola funds are critically needed to prevent another Ebola crisis. I have total confidence in the CDC, but they need this emergency funding request to be granted. We are about to go on a 1-week recess. There is no reason that we can't at least get on the supplemental this week. This is an absolute emergency. There are a lot of things we are doing that are important this week in terms of individual appropriations bills, but let's be clear: None of these appropriations bills are going to pass in the next week or even the next month. We still have the House that needs to take action, and there is no doubt we are going to go to conference. So in terms of whatever other legislative vehicles are pending or about to be pending, there is no urgency for us to move to those instead of what is happening right now in terms of a public health emergency with Zika. This is an absolute emergency. The reason this is not smashing through every headline online, on television, in the newspapers, and on the radio is that it is still cold outside in a lot of places and the mosquitoes haven't come out. This is about to be a very serious public health crisis. For those of us who have differing views about the size and scope of government, I just want to say this: We have arguments about the EPA's role, about the Department of Human Services' role, about the Department of Education's role, and the size and scope of government across the board, but can't we agree that government's basic job is to protect its citizens, and can't we agree that the CDC is one of the best agencies in the government across the board, and can't we agree that this is a real emergency and ought not to wait until May or June or July and ought to be taken up immediately? Mr. President, this is an emergency, and we ought to fund the supplemental on a big bipartisan vote. Trans-Pacific Partnership Mr. President, I would like to talk about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Many promises were made about the TPP. Before the final text was available, I received dozens of phone calls from advocates of the deal asking for my support. They said that this trade agreement was going to be different; that it would raise standards rather than lower them; and that my concerns about labor, the environment, climate change, public health, and consumer protection would be addressed. But since the text was released, I have read it, and unfortunately this deal does not turn out to be any different from the previous deals. It looks like just another race to the bottom. Proponents claimed that the labor and environment chapters would contain enforceable commitments, and I know a lot of people worked very hard to make that true. But when you look closely at the wording of these chapters, you see that the commitments are basically just strongly worded suggestions. There are very few requirements. Instead, the countries have promised to ``promote,'' ``encourage,'' ``cooperate,'' ``strive,'' and ``endeavor'' to do various things. I have no clue how one can enforce an obligation to encourage something or discourage something. Many of the provisions contain this weak language, carefully written by lawyers to be unenforceable. Here are a few examples from the environment chapter, which is particularly weak. First, the chapter opens with a general commitment that ``each Party shall strive to ensure that its environmental laws . . . provide for, and encourage, high levels of environmental protection.'' That is right; they are to ``strive to ensure.'' On transitioning to a low-emissions economy, ``Parties shall cooperate to address matters of joint or common interest.'' There is nothing more on climate change whatsoever. On marine animal conservation, ``Each party shall promote the long- term conservation'' of sharks and various marine animals through ``such measures'' considered appropriate. I don't even know what that means. What is clear is that none of this is enforceable. So the problem is, no accountability. There is no requirement that countries meet their obligations before Congress has to vote on the agreement and no independent verification of whether those obligations are ever met. We will vote to open our markets on day one to goods made under terrible labor and environmental conditions and hope that over time, after we have forfeited our leverage, these countries will implement and enforce the kinds of labor laws our country has had for decades. What this means is that we are giving them the deal, and after we forfeit all of our leverage, we hope they will see the light and do the right thing. Take Vietnam as an example. The economic benefits to Vietnam of reduced or eliminated U.S. duties are enormous. Importers from Vietnam currently pay around $2 billion in annual tariffs. Most of that comes from imports of apparel and footwear--industries that frequently utilize forced and child labor. Although Vietnam is supposed to comply on day one with the labor side agreement it signed with the United States, there is no independent verification. The side agreement sets up a long process of consultation before punitive action can be taken. At that point, Vietnam will already be enjoying the benefit of the elimination of the tariff, and the United States will have lost jobs that cannot compete [[Page S2439]] with forced child labor. No punitive action will bring back those jobs. Now let's talk about the enforcement side. Our track record, unfortunately, is not good. In the limited instances in which there are enforcement mechanisms in our trade agreements, we rarely utilize them. Recently, the GAO reported a systemic failure to enforce labor and environmental commitments across several trade agreements, even in light of compelling evidence of violations. The reason for this is that we don't really provide the resources for enforcement. But more importantly, there is a real lack of political will. For instance, the inclusion of Malaysia in this trade zone gives us insight into the lack of political will. When we debated fast-track authority last year, Congress agreed on an important negotiating objective: No trade deals with countries that earn the worst human trafficking ranking, according to the U.S. State Department. This seems like something everyone ought to agree to. At the time, this included Malaysia, which had the lowest ranking. But just after fast-track became law, Malaysia's ranking was upgraded--to the surprise of human rights experts everywhere. The upgrade allowed the circumvention of Congress's will and the continued inclusion of Malaysia in TPP. This came just a few months after the discovery of human cages and 130 graves at a human trafficking detention camp on the Malaysia-Thailand border. Against this backdrop, it is hard to have confidence that we will ever prioritize labor rights, human rights, or environmental protection over commercial interests. I am also deeply concerned about the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions, or ISDS for short. ISDS provides a special forum outside of our court system that is just available to foreign investors. These investors are given the right to sue governments over laws and regulations that impact their businesses--a legal right that is not granted to a labor union, an individual, or anyone else. Here is how it works: If a decision is made by a national government that is contradicted by a provision in a trade agreement, the trade agreement wins. If a law that we pass contradicts a provision in TPP, TPP trumps our law. Corporations are increasingly seeing this as a viable legal strategy to increase profits and undermine public health and environmental and labor protections. The ISDS forum is not available to anyone other than foreign corporations. It is not open to domestic businesses, labor unions, civil societies, or individuals who allege a violation of a trade agreement obligation. The arbitrators in ISDS who preside over these cases are literally not accountable to anyone. Their decisions cannot be appealed. By profession, the arbitrators usually make their living working as lawyers for multinational corporations. The arbitrators cannot force the government to change its laws, but they can order the government to pay the investor when they lose money as a result of a law that contradicts a trade agreement, which can have the same effect. It is one thing for the United States to decide to pay a penalty to keep a law in place, but small countries cannot afford to go up against these multinational corporations in the ISDS context. Not only will they repeal their national laws, they sometimes will not enact national laws knowing that they will be subject to fines under this ISDS process. The government often agrees to change the law or regulation that is being challenged, in addition to paying compensation. The threat of a case can be enough to convince a government to back away from legitimate public health, safety, or environmental policies. The practical implication is potentially sweeping. ISDS could prevent us from addressing climate change, raising the minimum wage, protecting consumers from harmful products, or preventing another financial crisis. Each time we pass a law or regulation to improve the lives of the American people, foreign investors will effectively have the final say. These risks are not theoretical. In fact, for the United States, the risk of ISDS has become very real. In January, TransCanada--the Canadian company behind the Keystone XL Pipeline--filed a claim against the U.S. Government under NAFTA's ISDS provisions for failing to approve the pipeline. If TransCanada wins, taxpayers--U.S. taxpayers-- would be on the hook for $15 billion in damages being demanded by foreign corporations. Make no mistake. This is a new strategy for fossil fuel companies to challenge laws and regulations that are attempting to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. There are hundreds of billions of dollars at stake, and with that on the line, you have to believe that law firms are spending hours systematically scouring every trade and investment agreement for provisions they can use to invalidate Federal law. This is the legal strategy to bust up laws designed to protect public health, the environment, and consumers. Corporate interests should not be the driving force for public policy decisions. Yet that is exactly what this trade agreement would allow. A lot of us had hopes that this trade agreement would be different, but in a lot of ways, it is the same as the bad agreements that have come before it, and in some ways, it is actually worse. We are forfeiting valuable leverage across a huge area of the Asia Pacific that we could have used to lift labor and environmental conditions and level the playing field for our workers. This is not a question of whether you are for trade or whether you believe we should be engaged in the Pacific region, it is a question of how. This deal is, unfortunately, a lowest common denominator agreement. For these reasons, I must oppose the TPP. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Wyoming. The Republican-Led Senate Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I head home to Wyoming just about every weekend. Lots of people from Wyoming come here to Washington to visit as well. When I am home, I get a chance to talk to people, and here in Washington, I get to talk to people. So yesterday is a day I flew here. I had talked to folks in Wyoming early in the morning and then yesterday afternoon got off the plane, and there were a number of students here from Sheridan High School from ``We the People.'' One of our pages here is also from that high school. So you get to hear a lot from people. Some folks have been asking: What has the Republican Congress actually accomplished? So I would like to take a few minutes to talk a little bit about what the Senate has actually done this year and during this Congress since the Republicans have taken over the majority. We are not even 4 months into this year, and we have already had a very productive year in the Senate. It is true. We have been active, we have been effective, and it is only April. In February, we passed legislation to add tough new sanctions against North Korea. As the Presiding Officer knows, the President in the White House was very reluctant when we started proposing these sanctions-- hesitant about the sanctions that we proposed against North Korea. Let's face it. North Korea has been aggressively testing missiles, testing nuclear weapons, and needs to be stopped. When other countries threaten their neighbors, as North Korea has done in their general geographic area, what happens is the United States must stand up and stop them. President Obama has done far too little. I am very concerned about the aggression and the ambitions of North Korea. That is why the Senate had to act. So Congress has stood up and pushed against this action. We had more action against North Korea; that is exactly what we did. The Senate also acted by passing a Defend Trade Secrets Act to help businesses protect their confidential information. We passed a piece of legislation called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation to help fight the misuse of prescription drugs, in terms of prescription pain killers called opioids. Now, look, it has been a huge problem in our country-- communities all around the country. Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire and Senator Portman of Ohio were two of the main sponsors of this legislation. I know [[Page S2440]] Senator Portman was on the floor recently, talking about different legislation. But he has shown heroic leadership in an area that certainly needed to be addressed. The Senate worked and reauthorized the Older Americans Act. This was another bipartisan piece of legislation. It works to help provide senior citizens with things like meals, transportation--ways to help people live in their own homes longer and ways to help in terms of their quality of life, which is very important for Americans all across the country. We passed legislation to overhaul and reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. This is a significant accomplishment. This legislation promotes U.S. aerospace jobs by cutting through some of the redtape that has been hurting airplane designers. Then, just last week, we passed a comprehensive overhaul of American energy policy, something we had not done in about 8 years. Over the past few years, hard-working Americans have made this country into an energy superpower. Yet we had not passed any kind of major energy legislation for about 8 years because Washington's regulations have simply not kept pace, and they have actually worked against the energy producers, people that are getting back to work, getting this country's economy returned. The legislation we passed is going to rein in some of this needless, wasteful bureaucracy that the Federal Government has imposed on the people creating energy jobs and working to produce more energy because energy is called a master resource for a reason. We have it in great abundance. One of the very important parts was language to expedite the shipment of America's natural gas to buyers around the world. It is good for our economy, and it is good for our allies who will be able to decrease their dependence on Russian gas. Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska did an outstanding job of making sure that this legislation had ideas from both sides of the aisle. That is a big part of why this piece of major energy legislation--first time in 8 years--passed 85 to 12--85 to 12. That is another big accomplishment of the Senate this year that does not get enough attention. It is not just that we are passing important legislation that helps Americans, but we are doing it in a bipartisan way that allows every Senator--every Member of this body--to represent the people back home with their ideas and their suggestions. We have voted on 129 amendments so far this year--129 amendments voted on this year. When the Democrats under Harry Reid were in control, a lot of people around here got used to the idea that people did not actually get to vote on amendments. In 2014, the last year under Democratic control under Harry Reid, the Senate had only 15 up- or-down votes on amendments all year--full calendar year 2014. When Republicans took the majority, we changed that. The Senate has been working this year just as we worked last year. We could have done a lot more if a few Democrats had not blocked progress on some very important pieces of legislation. The people in Wyoming now know that there are some important things they really care about, and they were actually blocked by President Obama. In January, the President vetoed legislation that we had passed to improve health care in this country by repealing major parts of ObamaCare. Remember, the President said to Democrats that they should forcefully defend and be proud of that health care law, but one out of four Americans--25 percent of Americans--say they have been personally harmed by the President's health care law. So we put it on his desk to do a repeal, and he vetoed that. Now, only about one in eight people in this country say they have been helped by the health care law. When you take a look at major legislation that impacts the country, it is no surprise that this health care law continues to be very unpopular, especially when you see that for every one person who says they have been helped, there are almost two people who said they have personally been hurt by the law. The President also vetoed legislation that we passed here to bring some sanity to something called the waters of the United States rule-- again, a rule put out in regulation by the President, a reinterpretation of the law. The law is very clear to me, but the President had his own approach. We put a bill on his desk to overturn what he has tried to do. The courts have actually stopped him in his tracks, but he once again vetoed our efforts. Last year the President actually vetoed five different bills passed by Congress. This kind of obstructionism from President Obama doesn't help our country move forward. It is not helpful when the Democratic leaders do everything they can to convince people that nothing is being done in the Senate, but we hear that day after day from Minority Leader Harry Reid. It is interesting, because when Senator Reid was the majority leader, he had a very firm strategy, and the strategy seemed to be to do as little as possible. Well, he is now the minority leader, and I think he went from the majority to the minority for a reason. It seems to me that he is still hanging on, clinging on to that losing strategy. The plan didn't work then, and I think that one of the reasons that he continues to try to talk down and slow down some of our progress is because, actually, he is envious--envious of anyone who gets things done in the Senate. Republicans in the Senate are not interested in working at Harry Reid's pace and neither are the Democrats--many of the Democrats. Most Senators agree that we have a lot of work to do and that it is good for America when we actually do the work. That is why we have been working our way through the appropriations bills. This year we got the earliest start ever to appropriations bills--and really in the history of the modern budget process. So we continue to work on that. I wish to be clear on one important point. Doing our job in the Senate doesn't mean setting aside the priorities of the American people just to help President Obama build a political legacy. That is why the Senate is going to stand firm and strong to give Americans a voice in who gets to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Now President Obama wants us to set aside everything else and let him appoint his Justice to the Supreme Court. It is not going to happen. We do our job every day, doing the things that will make an immediate difference to the families all across the country, things that Republicans and Democrats agree on and that everybody knows we should be doing. That is what you are seeing with this Republican-run Senate. That is what the people want us to do. That is what they expect us to do, and that is what we will continue to do. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 20 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Climate Change Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today is the 135th time I have come to give voice to the issue that I feel will most significantly define this generation of leadership in the United States and, frankly, around the globe. I know that there are many people in Washington who would prefer to ignore what our carbon emissions are doing to our oceans and to our climate, but we disregard nature's warnings at our peril. The changes to our environment, fueled by our carbon pollution, are far-reaching--from the coastlines to the prairies, from mountain tops to deep oceans, from pole to pole. As a terrestrial species, we naturally pay more attention to what is happening on land, such as increasing average global temperatures and upheavals in extreme weather. We don't so much see what is happening in our oceans. Every year we emit into the Earth's thin atmosphere tens of gigatons of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels--nearly 36 gigatons of carbon dioxide in 2014. Not all of that carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere. Our oceans--the Earth's oceans--absorb approximately one- third of all our carbon pollution. That means they have absorbed roughly 600 gigatons in our industrial era. For the record, a gigaton is a billion tons--not a thousand tons, not a million tons, but a billion tons--and 600 [[Page S2441]] billion tons of carbon dioxide have gone into our oceans. We know what that does. All that carbon dioxide in the oceans changes the ocean's very chemistry, and it makes ocean water more acidic. The chemical reaction, carbon dioxide reacting with water to form carbonic acid, is simple. You can replicate it in a middle school science lab, but its effects in the oceans are profound. According to research published in the journal Nature Geoscience, the rate of change in ocean acidity is already faster than at any time in the past 50 million years on Earth. We are rapidly spiraling into unknown territory. By way of context, the human species has been around on Earth for about 200,000 years. The human species started farming and herding, went from hunting and gathering to the basics of socialized human life less than 20,000 years ago. We are doing something to our planet now that has no precedent for 50 million years. This line shows the increasing CO 2 in the atmosphere in parts per million. This line shows the absorption of the CO 2 by the ocean, and this line shows the pH change in the oceans as a result. I would point out that pH is actually measured on a logarithmic scale. So if you were to adjust this to the standard percentage-type display of information, you would see this falling much more steeply. This is a very conservative way of showing what is happening to our oceans. The logarithmic scale is a multiple, not just a steady line. So as you move down the pH numbers, you are actually creating much more massive effects in the ocean. People have measured this drop in ocean pH from climate change. This is not a theory. You can go out and measure it with equipment that is not very different, again, from what a middle school with an aquarium would use to measure pH in the aquarium. People measure something else in our oceans also. They measure the rise in ocean temperature. For decades, the oceans have absorbed over 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gas emissions. The heat that comes in, that gets trapped in our thin atmosphere when the Sun's warmth gets trapped by these greenhouse gasses, lands in a variety of places. The Antarctic ice sheet gets two- tenths of a percent of the heat. The Greenland ice sheet gets two- tenths of a percent of the heat. Arctic sea ice gets eight-tenths of a percent of the heat. Glaciers and icecaps take up nine-tenths of a percent of the heat. All of our continents together, the land mass of the Earth, take up 2.1 percent of the added heat from climate change. The atmosphere, that thin membrane that allows us to live and breathe on this planet, has taken up 2.3 percent of the heat. All the rest of it, 93 percent, has been taken up by the oceans. They are our refrigerant. They are our cooler. They are the air conditioner for the planet. But when you take up that much, things begin to change, and ocean heat is ramping up. A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that in the last 20 years--actually, less than 20, from 1997 to now, to be exact--the oceans absorbed the same amount of heat energy just in that 20-year period as they had in the previous 130 years. That is a dramatic increase in heat uptake by the oceans. It is our human activity, specifically our unfettered burning of fossil fuels, that has made our oceans both warmer overall and more acidic. One result of this is the calamity now taking place in the world's coral reefs. A healthy coral reef is one of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on Earth. It is an engine for the propagation of life. Coral depends on a symbiotic relationship with tiny, photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae. They live in the surface tissue of the coral. Within a limited range of temperature, pH, salinity, and water clarity, this symbiosis can thrive, and it gives us reefs all over the world--these engines of life in the ocean. Living coral has evolved for millions of years to maintain its symbiosis within that range. We are now measurably--not theoretically but measurably--altering the ocean in ways too fast for coral to adapt. Push corals out of their comfort range for very long, and the corals get stressed and they evict their algae. This process is what is known as coral bleaching. Because corals get most of their food out of that symbiotic relationship with these algae, if the algae can't be reabsorbed quickly, the corals die. Coral bleaching sounds benign, but it is like cardiac arrest for a reef. There is a good chance it dies and, even if it doesn't, it is a long recovery. We are currently in the middle of a massive bleaching of the world's coral reefs--cardiac arrest at a global scale. Dr. Mark Eakin of NOAA's Coral Reef Watch Program says of this coral cataclysm: ``It very well may be the worst period of coral bleaching we have seen.'' And when he says ``we have seen,'' he means that which we have ever seen in the human record. Worldwide, coral has already declined by approximately 40 percent. Closer to home, across the Caribbean and the Florida Keys, two key coral species have declined by an astonishing 98 percent in the last four decades. In my lifetime, I have seen once-radiant underwater ecosystems teeming with life become barren fields of white skeletons reaching into an empty ocean. One of my climate trips took me down to Monroe County, FL, where I met Mayor Sylvia Murphy, the Republican mayor of Monroe County, home to the famous Florida Keys. I asked her how the reefs were off the Keys. ``Beautiful,'' she said, ``unless you were here 15 years ago.'' Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral ecosystem on Earth. It is one of the seven wonders of the natural world. Severe bleaching is now hitting ``between 60 and 100 percent of corals'' on the Great Barrier Reef, according to Dr. Terry Hughes of James Cook University in Queensland, Australia. Professor Hughes tweeted out a map of the current devastation, writing in the text: ``I showed the results of aerial survey of bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef to my students, and then we wept.'' As with many other effects of climate change, it can be difficult to convey the magnitude of events when they aren't taking place in front of our terrestrial human faces. In his 2010 TED talk, one of the great marine scientists we have, leading coral ecologist Dr. Jeremy Jackson, tried to bring this coral bleaching calamity a little closer to home. He put it like this: Imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or North America, and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you, and you see that 80 percent of the trees, as far as you can see, have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked. And you come home, and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves. Remember, this is his example from July. And then you read in the paper a few weeks later, ``Oh, by the way, a quarter of those trees died.'' Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino, an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe, when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died. Jeremy came to speak to our caucus recently. He told us that every ocean ecosystem he studied in his career is gone, as he first found it, changed dramatically from his first visit. Coral reefs are one of the first places that truly irreversible effects of climate change seem to be manifesting themselves--the proverbial canary dying in the coal mine of our carbon-ridden planet. To say the ocean we knew in our childhood is already gone is not doomsaying or pessimism, it is a grimly realistic assessment of where we stand, sadly. In the Senate, there will likely be snickering about this. Some will say: Who gives a damn about coral reefs? If it can't be monetized by a corporation, the hell with it, is too often our motto here. Well, God made these glories. God made them on our planet. In some cases, they have been growing for tens of thousands of years. We are wrecking them in a single generation, and if that doesn't mean something to us, a long look in the mirror might be in order. Even those who can only see this tragedy through their monetizer goggles ought to know that a decline in healthy coral reefs is a huge blow to us all. According to an article last month in The Atlantic, coral reefs are home to 25 percent of the world's fish biodiversity. Reefs are incubators for ocean life, support systems for fisheries we depend on, tourist attractions for divers and snorkelers who fill local communities with their visiting and [[Page S2442]] their spending, and they are coastal protection for coastal infrastructure and homes against storm waves. It is not nice to fool with Mother Nature. As Pope Francis warned, ``God always forgives; mankind sometimes forgives; nature never forgives. You slap her and she will slap you back.'' As he says, we are sinning with our actions against nature, and nature will not forget. We just don't have that right. We are making a mark on the Earth in this generation that will not go away. If mankind lasts 10,000 years, well, 10,000 years from now they will see and know the mark of this generation on our planet, and they will justly inquire: How could we have been such fools? How could we, in this generation, have been such greedy, reckless, self-infatuated fools? In 1954, the United States detonated a hydrogen bomb over the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The explosion vaporized everything on three islands, raised water temperatures to as much as 55,000 degrees, and left a crater over a mile wide and 240 feet deep. More than 60 years have gone by and scientists observe the corals in this part of the Pacific flourishing again. If you give it a chance, life finds a way. Dr. Zoe Richards, one of the scientists involved in the study, said: ``The healthy condition of the coral at Bikini Atoll today is proof of their resilience and ability to bounce back from massive disturbances, that is, if the reef is left undisturbed and there are healthy nearby reefs to source the recovery.'' So that is the caveat. Reefs can recover but not if we continue to stack the deck oceanwide against them by pumping so much heat and carbon pollution into the oceans. Senator Schatz of Hawaii--not coincidently another ocean State-- introduced, along with me, the American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act last year to address climate change with a market-based solution built on principles espoused by leading Republican economists. We went to Republicans--former Cabinet officials, former Members of Congress, economists, think tanks--and we said: How should we do this? If you don't like the President's plan, if you don't like the regulatory way, what is your way? Virtually every single person on the Republican side who has thought this problem through to a solution has come to the same place, a revenue-neutral carbon fee with an appropriate border adjustment. So that is what we wrote. When you are ready, we are here. We did it your way. As a Senator, John F. Kennedy once said: Let us not despair but act. Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past--let us accept our own responsibility for the future. This is particularly true for our oceans. As one Florida mayor put it: ``The ocean is not Republican, and it's not Democratic . . . it's a nonpartisan ocean,'' and that nonpartisan ocean is screaming warnings at us that we ought to heed in nonpartisan fashion. We have a clear scientific understanding of the problem, and we have a moral obligation to act. Time is not on our side. We need to pay attention to the evidence. We need to accept the reality of our predicament as it is communicated to us by the laws and signs of nature--God's signals to us on this Earth. That is what healthy coral looks like under the water. Here it is bleached out and dying. It is our ocean. It is our responsibility. I urge this body to wake up and lead. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Tribute to Dr. Emily Lembeck Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to do something I periodically like to do when a citizen of my State deserves recognition for the contributions they have made to my State and the citizens of my State. Today is such a day. Dr. Emily Lembeck is the superintendent of the Marietta City Public School System. Recently, she was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Education, and her palm print is embedded in the walk around Glover Park Square in Marietta, GA. I am close to Emily in more ways than one. When I chaired the State board of education in 1996, she was an elementary school principal at Dunleith Elementary in Marietta, GA. She had been at West Side, she moved on to Marietta Middle School, and later became superintendent of the Marietta Public Schools--8,900 students, 1,200 employees--a challenge but a wonderful community. Throughout her career, she has gifted more to children in our community than any person I know of. In particular, she has taught those who didn't know how to read to read. She has made reading a passion in our community. She has made children's ability to read and comprehend and understand and move forward in life a reality, in a place where at one time it was no reality at all. In fact, let me tell you, when I was chairman of the State board of education we were working hard to make Reading First a movement in this country. She came forward with this idea about adopting something called Marietta Reads. It was a very simple program but a program where leaders in the community, such as I, would come to elementary schools in Marietta, GA, sit down ``Indian style'' on the floor with first graders and teach them to read, read with them, and help them identify with the joy of reading and the understanding of reading. From that day, I gained a greater appreciation for the challenge every teacher faces as they teach our children in classrooms. Emily Lembeck has been awarded almost every award you can possibly get, from the chamber of commerce to the Kiwanis Club, to the Rotary. She has received the Living the Dream Award from the NAACP during King Week a few years ago, she received the Whitney M. Young Jr. Service Award from the Boy Scouts for her leadership. Time and again, Emily Lembeck has been represented to be the great person she is--a leader in education, a leader of children, somebody our community is proud of. So on this day in Washington, DC, on the floor of the Senate, I want the name of Emily Lembeck to ring from one corner to the other for all she has contributed and all she has done to make our community a better, more wholesome, and more meaningful community, and for what she has done to make the lives of our community's children just a little bit better. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Indian Health Service Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, for years now, patients on Indian reservations in the Great Plains area have been receiving substandard medical care. The most recent example of the Indian Health Service's failure occurred in December of 2015, when I was notified that two federally operated Indian Health Service facilities in my State were at risk of losing their Medicare provider agreements. In other words, these two facilities have been delivering such a poor level of care, the government isn't sure it is willing to continue paying these facilities to care for Medicare patients. In February, at the request of several Senators, myself included, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing to address the state of patient care at the Indian Health Service in the Great Plains area. Thanks to the graciousness of our colleague from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, who chairs the Indian Affairs Committee, I was able to participate in this hearing and question several Indian Health Service officials. I wish I could report that this hearing reassured me that the Indian Health Service is on track to solve the problems facing patients on the reservations, but it just left me more concerned. The hearing underscored the government's massive failure on this issue: its failure to deliver quality care, its failure to ensure patient safety, and its failure to live up to treaty responsibilities. [[Page S2443]] I have read the reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and some of the stories really are beyond comprehension. Incredibly, a report of dirty, unsanitized medical equipment left exposed in an emergency room isn't even the most shocking of those stories. One patient who had suffered a severe head injury was discharged from the hospital mere hours after checking in, only to be called back later the same day when his test results arrived. The patient's condition was so serious that he was immediately flown to another facility for care. One health service facility was in such disarray that a pregnant mother gave birth on a bathroom floor--a bathroom floor--without a single medical professional nearby, which shockingly wasn't the first time this had happened at this facility. I wish I were able to stand here today and report that conditions are getting better. Unfortunately, I cannot. Since February's hearing, we have been made aware of another tragic event that occurred at Pine Ridge Hospital. Reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services indicate that a 23-year-old patient complaining of nausea and cramping in his hands and lower extremities died from cardiac arrest 2 hours after he was discharged from the emergency department. An investigation conducted by CMS verified that this young man failed to receive an adequate medical screening evaluation before his discharge. Even worse, the report indicated that there was no documentation showing nurse and doctor communication. It hasn't helped that Congress's attempts to address these problems have been hampered by less-than-honest reporting from the Indian Health Service. Time and again, we have found that conditions on the ground have not matched up to information reported to Congress. In 2014, I requested a status update from the then-Acting Director of the Indian Health Service. In her response, she stated that ``the Great Plains Area has shown marked improvement in all categories'' and that ``significant improvements in health care delivery and program accountability have also been demonstrated.'' Significant improvements? Sending a man home with bleeding in his brain and having a mother give birth prematurely on a bathroom floor are not signs of significant improvements. On December 4, 2015, officials from the Indian Health Service stated that a majority of the concerns at Rosebud Hospital had been addressed or abated. Yet, mere hours later, I was informed that the Rosebud Hospital emergency department was functioning so poorly that emergency patients would be diverted to other hospitals beginning the next day. It has now been 143 days, and the Indian Health Service leadership has been unable to reopen the Rosebud Hospital's emergency department. For the last 143 days, incoming emergency patients have had to travel between 44 and 55 miles to receive care. That is similar to requiring a resident of Harpers Ferry, WV, to travel to Washington, DC, to receive emergency services. And to date, the Indian Health Service has been unable to tell us when it anticipates emergency department services will resume. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe informs me that since this emergency department has been on diverted status, six individuals have lost their lives in ambulances while being transported to a hospital farther away. Six families are now left to wonder whether their loved ones could have been saved if the Indian Health Service had been doing its job. This is unconscionable. The Indian Health Service has one last chance this Friday to reach an agreement with CMS to set the Rosebud Hospital back on a path to compliance with basic safety and administrative requirements. If the Indian Health Service fails to do so, Rosebud will lose its status as a Medicare provider. Additionally, the Indian Health Service has until Friday to address Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act violations found at Pine Ridge Hospital. The administration has drafted report after report promising to correct these issues, yet time and again it has failed to follow through. During the recent Indian Affairs Committee hearing, the former Principal Deputy Director of the Indian Health Service could not remember that he was in charge of implementing a 2011 report. Where is the accountability? Who is in charge? We have got to do better. Simply shifting staff between positions and offices, as the Indian Health Service has done in response to these problems, is not enough. It is time for action. We must do everything within our power--we will do everything within our power--to hold the Indian Health Service accountable and to make sure this never happens again. I continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate on a path forward to demand accountability from an agency that, by all accounts, is disconnected and unresponsive to the needs of our Native Americans. I will also continue to consult with the nine tribes in South Dakota. Our tribes are in the best position to help figure out the path forward for their own health care, and I believe the Indian Health Service must do a better job of consulting with our tribes when it comes to the care they receive. I am going to do everything I can within my power to get all of our tribal citizens the quality care they deserve. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The remarks of Mr. Burr pertaining to the introduction of S. 2854 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. BURR. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the one in three Ohioans who knows somebody who is struggling with addiction to heroin or prescription drugs. I rise today on behalf of the over 5,000 Americans who have lost their lives to a prescription drug overdose since the Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act back on March 10. I rise today to talk about an epidemic which is affecting my home State of Ohio, which is affecting all our States, whichever it is, and which is affecting our country and must be dealt with. This is the fourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate since we passed CARA, which is the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, and I come to floor to talk about our legislation and to ask the House of Representatives to please pass that legislation, which would then go to the President for his signature and could begin to help in communities all across the country. The legislation I am talking about is legislation that the Senator from New Hampshire, now who is the Chair right now, the Presiding Officer, has been involved with in a very deep way in her own State of New Hampshire and also here on the Senate floor. I appreciate all the hard work she has put into this, and I know she agrees with me that it is time for the House to act. We passed it on March 10. That means it has been 47 days since the Senate acted. About 120 Americans die every day of a drug overdose. It has been 47 days. That means we have lost 5,600 Americans to drug overdoses since the Senate passed this bill. By the way, it is not just about that tragic loss of life, it is about so many people who may not have overdosed but have this addiction and are not taking care of their families, are not able to work and be a productive citizen, are not achieving their God-given potential. It is about those who have overdosed but have been saved by this miracle drug that police and firefighters and other first responders and sometimes family members now are administering called Narcan or naloxone. It means that since the Senate passed this bill, this epidemic is getting worse, not better. That is based on [[Page S2444]] all of the information I get back home. Last week in Lebanon, OH--it is a small town north of Cincinnati, OH, where my family has roots going back to the 1920s--in Lebanon, OH, a 34-year-old woman, who was engaged to be married, overdosed and died in front of her children, one aged 10 and one baby girl who was still learning to walk. By the way, that little girl's father has now been arrested. Within days of her mother's addiction--she has now lost both her mom and her father. Last week, from Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday morning--Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday morning--six people died of overdoses in one small town called Elyria, OH. It is not a big city; there are about 53,000 people in Elyria. We lost six people in 24 hours. That does not include the 14 people who were saved by this miracle drug I talked about, Naloxone, that reverses the effects of an overdose. That is what has been happening. That is happening on our streets, and in the case of my home town of Cincinnati, it is happening in our parking lots. At noontime on Sunday, in my hometown, a man overdosed in the parking lot of the Museum Center in Cincinnati, OH. First responders moved quickly and were able to save his life. But it is happening in broad daylight, unfortunately, more and more frequently. Since 2007 drug overdoses have killed more people in Ohio than car accidents, making it the No. 1 cause of accidental death. I am told that nationally, now, it is the leading cause of accidental death in the country. It is not car accidents, which we would might have assumed, it is overdoses. They have more than tripled in Ohio from 1999 to 2010. We are told that 200,000 Ohioans are addicted to opioids--200,000 people. That is the size of a major city like Akron, OH. That is something which should concern us all. Last week there was a poll that showed that 3 in 10 Ohioans know someone who has abused prescription drugs, and 1 in 8 knows someone who has overdosed. We are talking about more than 1.3 million Ohioans. According to NIDA--the National Institute on Drug Abuse--the United States, even though we make up about 5 percent of the world's population, consumes 75 percent of the prescriptions drugs, including the vast majority of the world's prescription painkillers, the narcotic painkillers. They say four to five of the people who are heroin addicts started on prescription drugs. We have heard more about this this week in the news, about the fact that so many people get addicted to the opioid, which is the prescription drug. Sometimes it is actually prescribed to them; sometimes they obtain it illegally. They turn to heroin as a less expensive alternative and then end up overdosing. The results are tragic. If this is not an epidemic, I don't know what is. It is affecting every area. It knows no ZIP Code. So when you think about drugs and drug abuse and the effects of it, you might think inner city. That is not so. It is everywhere--in the suburbs, in the rural areas. It knows no ZIP Code. I mentioned that this legislation we worked on here for a few years passed the Senate. It was bicameral legislation, meaning it was the House and Senate working together for 3 years. We had five conferences here in Washington. We brought in experts on the issues of prevention and education and treatment and recovery and how to deal with our veterans who are coming back, who have a high rate of addiction, how to deal with women and their babies. In my home State of Ohio, we have had a huge increase in the rate of babies being born addicted, and what do you do about that? We put together this legislation in a comprehensive manner to handle not just one part or one sector but to be something that would deal with the holistic approach so that we could actually get at this issue. In the House, by the way, the identical legislation was introduced, and they now have over 120 cosponsors of that legislation in the House. Yet they have not been able to move on that legislation. Instead, they are moving on other legislation to deal with the issue. That is good. I am sure there are a lot of other things that can and should be done. Some of what they are doing is consistent with CARA. But we know CARA works. We know that if we can pass it, the President would sign it. We know it would help immediately in our communities. So I again call on the House to move quickly. Last week a subcommittee in the House chaired by Joe Pitts marked up one dozen bills that have to do with how we fight this epidemic. Joe Pitts is a man who cares a lot about this issue. He has a passion for it. This week my friend and full committee chairman Fred Upton is going to mark up those 12 bills. The House has a lot of good ideas. That is fine. That is good. I joined Congressman Bill Johnson of Marietta, OH, who has been a passionate advocate on this issue, to introduce something called the Preventing Abuse of Cough Medicine Act, which would restrict the sale of certain cough medicines that are frequently abused. That is good. It is a commonsense Ohio idea. I thank my friend and colleague for doing his part to help our constituents. That should be passed in addition to CARA, along with other legislation. I certainly respect my colleagues over there very much, as I said, but let's just give CARA a vote, and then let's move on this other legislation as well. It takes a while, as all of us are painfully aware, to get something through the process around here. This one went through with a 94-to-1 vote. It is comprehensive. It was introduced in both the House and the Senate. They have over 120 cosponsors. Let's just move that. Then, if there are other things to be dealt with, like the one I talked about, we can work on those as well and find ways to work together to find common ground. I will support that. I cannot speak for all of my colleagues, but I can speak for all of them--with the exception of one who voted the other way--to say that we will help get CARA to the President. In fact, it doesn't need to come back to the Senate if they pass the CARA legislation. More and more Members in the House are focused on this issue. That is good. Tomorrow, the House Judiciary Committee is also marking up legislation in this area. So this is a separate committee--the Energy and Commerce Committee--and now the Judiciary Committee. They are going to mark up five related bills, including what they consider the alternative to CARA. It has some of the CARA provisions but not all of them. Let me tell you what the experts out there are saying. There are over 120 groups who have endorsed our legislation, helped us to get our legislation through. Yesterday, the policy director of the Harm Reduction Coalition sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee saying that its alternative ``omits vital provisions in CARA addressing recovery, collateral consequences, prevention, and education. These omitted provisions represent critical community priorities, which truly relate to the comprehensiveness of CARA's approach. CARA was developed through a thorough process of extensive consultation with dozens of stakeholders . . . and has secured the broad support of national, state, and local addiction and recovery, public health, and criminal justice organizations. . . . The version of CARA passed by the Senate represents substantial consensus among both community stakeholders and bipartisan lawmakers.'' The House Judiciary's alternative to CARA does contain some of CARA's best proposals. I appreciate that. But unfortunately it dropped out a number of really important ones as well. Some of the most important ideas that are missing include provisions expanding drug takeback programs. Again, we talked about this earlier. These prescription drugs are at the heart of this problem. These takeback programs get these prescription drugs off the bathroom shelf, allow us to pull these drugs away from our communities so that people are not using these drugs to get into more drugs, to get into heroin. That is not in there. There is also a heroin law enforcement task force that was dropped out and a drug court for veterans called the veterans court. That is a very important issue for all of us. The veterans' testimony we got made it clear to us that these courts are working. I have toured some of these courts. I have had a chance to sit down at a roundtable discussion in Ohio with one of our [[Page S2445]] great veterans courts to talk to veterans whose lives have been entirely turned around by these veterans courts. After years and years of bouncing around in the prison system or at the VA, finally they get into these drugs courts for veterans, where they are surrounded by other veterans and they are able to pull their lives together, to get their families back together, and in one case go back to school. There is one guy who is about to graduate from Ohio State University after years and years of not being able to find a way to move forward. Here is another one. Patty McCarthy Metcalf of Faces and Voices of Recovery wrote in a letter today that taking out the CARA recovery provisions ``will prolong the crisis of addiction by not providing the critical support in communities across our nation where it is most needed. Recovery services provided by recovery community organizations, including recovery coaching and emergency rooms and drug courts and recovery education and awareness, are desperately needed and highly effective in getting people with addiction on a long-term path to recovery.'' What does she mean by all that? She means that these recovery coaches and the services that are supported by the CARA bill help people who might go, as she said, to an emergency room because they have an overdose to be confronted by somebody who says: Look, we can help you get better. You don't have to do this again. You don't have to overdose again. You don't have to go through this near-death experience. We can get you into a program where you can get treatment and recovery. Someone has to provide the resources for those coaches. We want those coaches. All of us as citizens should want them. We don't want people to keep overdosing again and again. We want to break that cycle. That is what our legislation would do. Patty makes the critical point that our response has to be comprehensive. I think she is right. She says: Prevention, treatment and enforcement cannot solve the opiate problem without recovery supports. National experts on addiction, and millions of people in recovery, will agree that a comprehensive approach is critical. That is what we do. CARA is comprehensive. There are 71 recovery groups, including the Ohio State University Collegiate Recovery Community, which sent a letter to the House Judiciary Committee and the Education and Workforce Committee today expressing concern that two sections of CARA which expand recovery supports for students in high school and in college were dropped out. These are amazing programs. I am so impressed with these brave young men and women who stand up and say: I have a problem. I have an addition. For other students at this high school or at this college, who, like me, have this addiction, have this disease, I want to help you. We should work together and come together in support groups. There did not use to be any of these hardly, as far as I know. Now there are a number of them. Ohio State University is one of the places that took the lead in this. I am so proud of those students who stood up and said: Despite the stigma around this, I am going to stand up and say that I have this problem, and I know many of you do too. If you do, come, and we can work together to work through this problem. Again, what they say is, ``We support a comprehensive approach to addressing this epidemic, which must include providing recovery supports that enable individuals to enter and sustain their recovery.'' Again, CARA is comprehensive. No other bill comes close. As this process moves forward, I hope we will insist that any final agreement represents a comprehensive approach because this epidemic has to be combated from all angles. The approach we took to writing CARA was to say we are going to take the best ideas regardless of where they come from. We don't care who brings them. We just care what the idea means to help address this problem. We had ideas from Democrats. We had ideas from Republicans. We had ideas from House Members, from Senators, from experts in law enforcement, and from patients in recovery. We didn't ask who had the idea, we asked if it was a good idea. That is how you cobble together good legislation that makes a difference in our communities. On Friday I was in Ohio chairing a hearing of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. It was at University Hospitals of Cleveland, OH. We heard from law enforcement experts such as the attorney general, Mike DeWine, and the acting U.S. attorney, Carole Rendon. She was great, as was Senator DeWine. Law enforcement, including the Fraternal Order of Police, has been strongly supportive of CARA because they believe this comprehensive approach works. We also provide training for the administering of this naloxone we talked about, the Narcan, and being sure that law enforcement has what they need to be able to help combat this issue. We also create these law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and methamphetamines. They want better tools, law enforcement does, so they can save lives. We owe them that. In Ohio I am that our first responders have used naloxone more than 16,000 times in the last year alone. Thank God for those first responders because they have saved thousands and thousands of lives. On Friday we also heard from Tracy Plouck from the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. We heard from Dr. Nancy Young of Children and Family Futures and Dr. Margaret Kotz, who is the director of Addiction Recovery Services at University Hospitals in Cleveland, one of the experts we have relied on. They talked about the recovery process. Their point was that probably 9 out of 10 people who need treatment are not getting it. That is a clear sign the status quo is not working. Some of it is the stigma we talked about earlier, people are not coming forward. Some of it is not having treatment programs that are accessible. We heard about waiting lists, sometimes 3 or 4 days, sometimes 14 days, sometimes a couple of months--and people being at that point in their lives where they are willing to come forward and say: I need to solve this problem. Yet there is a waiting list. Last night I had a tele-townhall meeting. We had 25,000 Ohioans on at any one time. It was a big group. People were talking about all kinds of issues, from the terrorist threat we face to energy and environment issues, to the jobs issue. One guy called in and he asked: What are you doing about treatment for people who have drug problems? So I told him about the CARA legislation and he seemed to have a quiver in his voice. I asked him: You seem to have a lot of interest in this and some information about it. Can you tell us your background? I thought perhaps he was a doctor or a treatment specialist. Unfortunately, he said what you hear more and more from parents, which is: I lost my child to addiction. She had an overdose. She died. And the reason I am so focused on treatment, Senator Portman, is because we got her to the place in her life where she was willing to go, finally, to a treatment center and get the treatment and recovery services she needed to deal with this disease that had gripped her--and there was no room at the inn. There was a waiting list. We couldn't get her in, and it was during that period that we couldn't get her into the treatment center that would have helped her that she overdosed. This is a caller from last night who--on a call--was willing to say this in front of 25,000 people. I told him I appreciated the fact that he had the courage to call in and the courage to talk about it. Of course, I expressed my sympathy to him and his family but asked him to continue talking about it, to channel that grief into something positive. Until we get more people into treatment, this is going to continue to be a huge problem in every one of our communities. Until we change the law, until we get legislation passed in Washington so we can be better partners, we are not going to be doing our part. Will Washington solve this problem? No. This problem is going to be solved in our communities, it is going to be solved in our families, and it is going to be solved in our hearts. We have to get people to pull away from this, to understand the dangers, better prevention and education. In our legislation, we have a prevention program to build awareness about the connection with prescription drugs and heroin. I bet most people listening [[Page S2446]] right now didn't know about that connection, a lot of people don't. Why would you, if you hadn't faced this issue? That awareness alone is going to make people make better decisions for themselves, for their children. Friday in Cleveland we had a man testify whose son died of an overdose. Do you know why? Because he had his molars--his wisdom teeth--taken out. When he had his wisdom teeth taken out, what happened? You know where I am going. They gave his son, a kid, Percocet--a narcotic, a painkiller. The rest of the story you know, which is he started taking more of those and more of those. Then he took some from the bathroom shelf of one of his relatives. He developed this addiction and eventually turned to heroin and overdosed. Now his father, God bless him, is out there talking to high schoolers, talking to middle schoolers, talking to young people about the dangers. We can address this issue. We know we can. There has been success with other awareness programs. Think of smoking and teen smoking. We have made great progress there. We have to make progress on this one. This is about life and death. We heard testimony on Friday from Dr. Michele Walsh, the director of neonatology at University Hospitals. She talked about how she is increasingly seeing babies who are born with what is called neonatal abstinence syndrome. That is a fancy way of saying these poor babies are born with an addiction. She said the symptoms are the same you would see with an adult. It is the fidgeting. It is the sweats. These are little babies. I have gone to these neonatal units, and I know some of my colleagues have. You see these babies. They are so small they can fit in the palm of your hand, and they are addicted. You have these doctors and nurses with incredible passion, such as Dr. Michele Walsh, who are taking care of them. In my home State of Ohio we have had a 750-percent increase in the last 12 years with babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome--a 750-percent increase. Every single neonatal unit in Ohio is facing this. I have been to Rainbow Babies & Children's in Cleveland, which is at this hospital. I have seen what they do. I have been to St. Rita's special care nursery in Lima, OH. I have been to Children's Hospital in my own hometown. They are doing great work, but wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to deal with this issue because we had better prevention and education to let mothers know what the danger is when they are pregnant and they could have better treatment and recovery to get those women out of this grip of addiction so their babies can be born without these issues. Frankly, the long-term effects we talked about at our hearing, talking to experts and doctors, I don't think people know what the long-term effects are--and of course that is scary. They basically take these babies through withdrawal. We have to provide babies with the medication at a lower level--but that you would provide an adult--to take them through the withdrawal process. CARA, the legislation we are talking about, would help these women. It would help these babies by expanding treatment for expectant and postpartum women as well as awarding grants to evidence-based treatment services and residential treatment programs for pregnant women who are struggling with addiction. It would create a pilot program to provide family-based services to women who are addicted to opiates in a nonresidential outpatient setting. It is what we learn from experts-- how to help address this problem--that is in this legislation. I know there are other ideas out there, and that is great, but stripping out some of CARA's core provisions just didn't make any sense to me. Let's keep it comprehensive. Let's be sure and get this legislation done and then work on additional legislation. The House could simply put CARA on the suspension calendar and have a vote on it. That is the calendar where you have to have a two-thirds vote, but something like this with all the cosponsors and all the interest in this issues now, I think it would pass. That means we are one vote away of getting this help to our communities. That is how close we are to a historic achievement to help begin to turn the tide, to make the Federal Government a better partner with our States, our local communities. Our great nonprofits are out there in the trenches doing the work and our families. There is no reason it couldn't happen today, tomorrow, or the next day before we go into another congressional recess. After 3 years of work, it doesn't make sense to start from scratch and try to rewrite this. Let's work together to come up with additional ideas that are course appropriate. Nobody has a monopoly on good ideas around here. Believe me, I know some of these House Members. They have the right intentions. They are trying to help. I appreciate that, but I also think we all need to appreciate the fact that this is a crisis. We are losing more and more Americans, 5,600 since CARA was passed in the Senate. Roughly every 12 minutes we lose someone else. People's lives are on the line. Communities are being impacted. Families are being torn apart. It is time for us to act and act quickly. I appreciate the time today. I urge the House to move quickly on this legislation so we can begin to help our communities in need. I yield back the remainder of my time. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ``El Faro'' Tragedy Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss, first of all, the successful location of the El Faro voyage data recorder by the NTSB. As you all recall, that was the ship that had sailed from Jacksonville and was lost at sea and everyone perished. Today, the NTSB found the data recorder. The U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy, and other search partners were also involved. That gives me hope that we will soon have more answers about this terrible disaster and how to prevent a similar one from happening again. So I want to thank the men and women of the investigative team who worked together to find this important piece of the El Faro puzzle. Today we are also reminded of those who were lost on the El Faro and the loved ones they left behind. They remain in our thoughts and prayers. Zika Virus Madam President, on a different topic, I wanted to come to the floor today and talk again about the Zika virus. Once again there was an announcement that there had been additional cases identified in Florida. Just to recap where we stand now, Zika has now spread to over 43 countries. There are 500 cases in U.S. territories, most of them on the Island of Puerto Rico. In my home State of Florida, there are now 93 cases--the most of any State--and the peak mosquito season is directly ahead. A lot has happened regarding Zika. We have learned more and more about this disease. For example, we are now learning the virus has a direct link to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a very debilitating, often fatal, illness, and it is striking people affected with it. We are learning through recent science that it is not just the first trimester of pregnancy but also potentially in the second trimester that unborn children can be impacted by this, and the impacts are devastating. We are learning that of the two species of mosquitoes that spread the disease, one of them has developed an immunity, a resistance to the most commonly used pesticide to remove them. So there is real concern as we head into the summer months and mosquitoes begin to appear that soon we will wake up to the news that there has now been a mosquito- borne transmission within the continental United States. Here is the bottom line: We don't know everything about this disease. We already know it is bad, but we don't know how bad it is. Every day we find out more things. We know during these summer months it will be increasingly warm in many parts of the country where the two mosquito species that spread the virus can be found--in 30 out [[Page S2447]] of 50 States. We know those mosquitoes tend to grow even faster during warm seasons and when there is a lot of water on the ground. And we know one of the countries most impacted by it--Brazil--will soon host the Summer Olympic Games, which means there is going to be a tremendous amount of travel to and from Brazil, and, in fact, there already is. We know the disease is not just spread through mosquitoes, but it is also sexually transmitted. The result of all this is that there is a real concern about what direction we are headed. The President has asked for $1.9 billion in funding, and I am generally supportive of that request. I believe we need to deal with these issues on the front end as quickly as possible. We don't want to wake up one morning to the realization that we are now in the middle of summer, this has become an epidemic or a catastrophe, and we didn't do anything on the front end. Everyone here will have to explain what their position was at the time. I also think you can be for Zika funding--you can even be for Zika funding at $1.9 billion--and you can also ask questions about how this money is going to be spent and, if possible, how we are going to pay for it because we are facing a debt situation in this country. I believe we can find $1.9 billion to pay for it. I have suggested some of my own. What we don't want to do is to play political games with this. I think it is important. On the one side, you can't just say: Look, I am against anything they are asking for that comes up unless you prove otherwise. I think it is important that we now admit this is a serious issue that needs to be confronted. But it is also not being an obstructionist to ask: How is the money going to be spent? What programs will be funded? Where is the prioritization going to be? I think it is not too much to ask to have a level of detail about that $1.9 billion. What I am concerned about is some of the reports in the news that there are games being played with this. We have heard the news that the administration has redirected $44 million in emergency preparedness grants promised to State and local governments this summer. Oftentimes in politics this is a very typical maneuver. What you do is, you cut money from an organization somewhere and you blame it on congressional inaction--or in the States, on legislative inaction. And they say the reason you are losing this money is that someone is not doing what we want, so you find the most painful, alarming cuts and use them as a leverage point to get pressure built on Congress. So I want to make sure that this is not part of some game. We shouldn't be playing games with this. I think it is also important to understand why, in addition to the $1.9 billion, they are also saying on top of that we also have to repay the $510 million in Ebola funds since the Ebola situation is now under control. These are all legitimate issues that need to be confronted. But in the end, we have to do something about this. I know the Senate and the Congress were not meant to move at warp speed, to say the least. It is a place in which action takes time, and I understand that. But there are things we don't have time for. This issue has to be dealt with on the front end. Summer is here already. If you have been in South Florida, as I have on weekends, and back in my home State, as I will be again this Friday and into the weekend, it is already hot. That heat, combined with a wet season, means mosquitoes. This is mosquito season. We have a disease that is already creating this catastrophic impact in countries neighboring us to the south. We know it is spread by mosquitoes. Mosquito season is rapidly approaching, and we have to get ahead of this. None of us wants to be in a position in June, July, and August where this thing breaks out and we start seeing cases in the continental United States, as we are already seeing in Puerto Rico and in Brazil, and we have no answer for why we did nothing during these months we were here. I don't know what all the impediments are. I know there are conversations going on at the committee level, but I hope we can bridge this rather quickly. There are so many other issues we can argue about. There are so many other issues we can have debates about in the partisan season. But I don't think a disease of this magnitude, with this level of risk, is one we should be playing games with. My hope is that cooler heads will prevail and that over the next few days we will find it within ourselves to find out how to appropriate the necessary money so we can begin to deal with this, at least on the front end. Maybe there is a chunk of money on the front end so we can begin to address it and then we can come back later and fund the rest of it. I think it is incumbent upon the administration and others to say ``This is what the money is going to be spent on'' so we can judge whether the money and the funds are actually going to things that work. But this needs to happen. This problem can't wait, and it shouldn't be a partisan fight. Combating Zika is an appropriate use of public dollars. It is an appropriate use of public dollars. I am for limited government. I am for a very limited Federal Government. But one of the things the Federal Government is tasked with is keeping our people and country safe, particularly from external threats. Traditionally, what that means is an invading army or some military threat from abroad or whatever. In this case, this is a threat emerging from abroad, but it is coming toward the United States. There is nothing that prevents the United States from becoming like some of these other countries that have been impacted by this--nothing. Our people are not genetically immune to Zika. It is a matter of time. It is not a question of if, it is a question of when there will be a mosquito-borne transmission of the Zika disease here in the United States. And when that happens, if the posture of the Congress has been that we did nothing--nothing has happened on this; we are still debating over $200 million or $50 million--people will not be satisfied with that answer. So my hope is that this is dealt with according to the level of urgency it deserves. As I said, in my home State of Florida we already have 93 cases, with 2 new ones over the weekend. Those numbers are only going to grow. It is just a matter of time before there is a mosquito- borne transmission somewhere in the United States--the continental United States, because, as I said, this has already occurred in Puerto Rico--and I hope we get ahead of it before it is too late. As I speak to the appropriators and those involved in this, my hope is that we can find our way forward on this rather quickly. There are so many other issues to argue about; this should not be one of them. The money needs to be spent the right way, but it needs to be spent and it needs to be appropriated, and we should endeavor to pay for as much of it, if not all of it, as we can. It needs to get quickly to the target. We need to move from this process and on to those programs so we can get ahead of it in May and June, before we get into the summer, before we get into mosquito season, and before we have an outbreak in the United States. If not, we then will have to answer to the people as to why nothing happened when we knew the risk was growing and the threat was emerging. With that, Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, it has been nearly 9 months since the United States had an Ambassador to Mexico. The President's nominee to that post, Roberta Jacobson, is eminently qualified for the post. The Arizona Republic noted in an editorial from March that ``she's qualified, respected and needed to do an important job.'' They are right. For more than 20 years, Ms. Jacobson has been immersed in the regional, political, economic, and security issues related to the Western Hemisphere. In fact, as part of her extensive background, she served for a time as Director of the Office of Mexican Affairs at the State Department. She is obviously [[Page S2448]] fluent in Spanish and has earned the respect of her colleagues. She served for 3 years as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Canada, Mexico, and NAFTA issues within the Bureau of Western Hemisphere--experience that would later serve the United States well given that Mexico is America's third largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totaling more than half a trillion dollars. However, she has been waiting for the Senate to confirm her nomination since the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported it to the Senate in November of last year by a vote of 12 to 7. It should be incomprehensible to anyone around the country to have a post of the top diplomat to one of our most important bilateral relations open for this long, but for Arizonans, it is particularly baffling. Arizona alone enjoyed a trade relationship with Mexico of nearly $17 billion last year. On the export side, Arizona exports about $9 billion in goods and services to Mexico every year, which, according to the Arizona Republic, ``accounts for 41 percent of the state's exports, and four times more than our state exports to our next biggest trading partner, Canada.'' According to the Arizona-Mexico Commission: With an economy that now surpasses $1.3 trillion, Mexico ranks as one of the top 20 economies in the world. Mexico's economy has been increasingly focused on manufacturing, particularly since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994. More than $1 billion in goods are exchanged between the United States and Mexico every day. But the U.S.-Mexico relationship is about more than just our economies; transportation issues, security threats, and natural resource management are just some of the fronts on which we cooperate with Mexico. The Arizona Republic notes that ``the Arizona Department of Transportation recently signed a memorandum of understanding to study ways to improve the trade corridor that spans the border.'' Arizona alone shares six ports of entry with Mexico, and Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport facilitates 122 flights a week to and from Mexico. All of this cooperation requires a close partnership between our two countries. The longer the United States goes without having an Ambassador to Mexico, the greater that partnership will suffer. To my knowledge, the holdup in this process is not based on any concrete concerns with the qualifications of this specific nominee. She enjoys overwhelming support. There is no reason not to move forward with this nomination. If there is opposition, then Members should have the opportunity to express it. As such, I will be asking unanimous consent for a time agreement with a rollcall vote on her confirmation. There is simply no reason we should not have an Ambassador to Mexico when we have a candidate as qualified as Roberta Jacobson. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 365; that there be 30 minutes for debate only on the nomination equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session without any intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Florida. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I agree that the U.S.-Mexico relationship is one of our most important bilateral relationships. We do need an ambassador in Mexico City who has a track record of effectively advancing U.S. interests. I do, however, have serious questions about the policies that Assistant Secretary Jacobson has pursued during her tenure in the Western Hemisphere Bureau. I have had conversations with the administration and others, such as Senator Corker, about the concerns, and I remain hopeful that we can find a way to resolve this issue in the very near future, but until then, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I plan to return frequently for as long as it takes to shed a light on this nomination and to make sure it moves forward, so I expect to be here tomorrow to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. World Intellectual Property Day Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the United States is one of the most dynamic and innovative countries in the world. Our Nation's success in areas such as agriculture, manufacturing, computer technology, and medicine can be traced in large measure to our respect for, and protection of, intellectual property. Every year on this day, April 26, we have the opportunity to recognize the important role of intellectual property rights in the fabric of our society when we celebrate World Intellectual Property Day. Nearly 230 years ago, our Founding Fathers recognized the importance of intellectual property and made provisions for its promotion and protection in the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause 8 empowers Congress ``to promote the Progress of Science and Useful arts, by securing, for limited Times, to Authors and Inventors, the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.'' Since that time--and stemming from these values--intellectual property has played a vital role in our economy, supporting jobs and advancing creative and scientific industries. In our modern, innovation economy, patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other forms of IP are more critical than ever. As the Global Intellectual Property Center recently pointed out in their broad survey of Intellectual Property in America, IP-intensive industries employ over 40 million Americans, accounting for 38 percent of total U.S. gross domestic product. Workers in IP-intensive industries are paid better than the national average, earning an average salary of over $50,000 compared to those in non-IP-intensive sectors where the average is roughly $39,000. In fact, intellectual property is so important to the American economy that the collective worth of all of the intellectual property in the United States is now above $5.8 trillion. In Iowa, we have seen how intellectual property has become an integral part of our economy. Our system of strong intellectual property protection has led to $11.2 billion in annual IP-related exports from the State, a total of 667,557 IP-related jobs, and 19.9 percent higher wages for direct IP workers than non-IP workers. Just as Iowans utilized strong IP laws 75 years ago when they were discovering how to feed the world through cutting-edge science, today's Iowans benefit from our system of IP protection as they start companies and create new tech success stories. The Judiciary Committee plays an important role in protecting intellectual property. The committee exercises jurisdiction over our Nation's intellectual property laws including those governing patents, trademarks, and copyrights. We consider legislation that helps to ensure that intellectual property rights continue to promote jobs and innovation. The committee also exercises important oversight of the Patent and Trademark Office, ICANN, the Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, and various law enforcement entities charged with protecting IP. Some recent examples of important legislation that helps promote intellectual property rights are the PATENT Act of 2015 and the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016. The PATENT Act, which passed the committee by a vote of 16 to 4 last June, takes important steps to stop abusive patent litigation practices. As bad actors are exploiting the high costs of litigation and using deceptive tactics to prey on businesses, it is important that this legislation be considered in the Senate. Just 3 weeks ago, the Senate unanimously passed the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, sponsored by Senators Hatch and Coons. Building upon the bipartisan consensus generated in the Judiciary Committee, the bill passed on the Senate floor by a vote of 87 to 0. It is estimated that the American economy loses 2.1 million jobs and over [[Page S2449]] $300 billion in economic losses every year because of trade secret theft. The Defend Trade Secrets Act brings much-needed uniformity to trade secret litigation. This will allow the creators and owners of trade secrets to more effectively address the growing problem of trade secret theft. The House of Representatives is expected to pass our bill this week and I hope it will be immediately signed by the President. Tomorrow, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on counterfeits and their impact on consumer health and safety. We will hear from a panel of experts, including witnesses from the Patent and Trademark Office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and industry. These businesses include companies that provide home health care products and equipment to our troops. They will discuss how counterfeits can harm consumers and what their impact is on the economy. We will hear how law enforcement is addressing this problem as well as how stakeholders are educating consumers to protect themselves from counterfeits. The focus of this year's World Intellectual Property Day is ``digital creativity.'' As the World Intellectual Property Organization notes, the current era of Internet connectivity is transforming how consumable culture such as films, TV, music, books, art, and other cultural works are created and distributed. This has led to radical changes in the way we access content and in how businesses operate. As challenges emerge as to how we protect intellectual property rights in these new economic models, we must continue to search for effective solutions that promote creativity across different mediums. So on this World Intellectual Property Day, it is important to once again recognize the significance of our Nation's robust system of intellectual property protection and enforcement. This system has helped create the United States' enduring role as a leader in innovation and creativity. As the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will continue to embrace my role as a promoter of intellectual property rights and American jobs. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2434-S2449] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado. Nomination of Merrick Garland Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the vacancy on the Supreme Court and the majority's ongoing refusal to consider the nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland. Forty days have passed since the President of the United States nominated Judge Garland to fill Justice Scalia's seat. This is longer than it took for the Senate to confirm Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981. In fact, 75 percent of all Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed within 31 days, but today-- 40 days after his nomination--many Senators haven't even extended Judge Garland the simple courtesy of a meeting. The majority's refusal to hold a vote is without precedent, and the majority has cited none. Instead, the majority is trying to shift the blame. Incredibly, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee recently came to the floor to blame, of all people, not other Senators, not other politicians, but the Chief Justice of the United States of America for politicizing the Court. Ten days before Justice Scalia's death, the Chief Justice said: ``The process is not functioning very well.'' That turns out to have been something of an understatement. The Chief Justice went on and said that the process ``is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees.'' Again, he was not referring to what is going on now in the Senate. This happened before Justice Scalia passed away. There was no way that the Chief Justice could have known there was going to be a vacancy. He continued: ``[Supreme Court Justices] don't work as Democrats or Republicans . . . and I think it's a very unfortunate impression the public might get from the confirmation process.'' His words struck me--particularly given what has gone on since then-- as a candid expression of his concern for the Court as an institution. This concern apparently upset the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He took to the floor and said: The Chief Justice has it exactly backwards. The confirmation process doesn't make the Justices appear political. He continued: The confirmation process has gotten political precisely because the Court has drifted from the constitutional text, and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences. It is absolutely breathtaking that the Chief Justice would be criticized for ``drifting from the constitutional text'' when, for the past 10 weeks, the majority has drifted from article II, section 2, clause 2, which sets out our constitutional responsibility to advise and consent in very clear terms. Worse, the majority's drift isn't even about policy; it is about politics. It is about rolling the dice on an election instead of following the plain text of the Constitution. This is absolutely unprecedented in the history of the Senate. Throughout our history, the Senate has confirmed 17 nominees in Presidential election years to serve on the Supreme Court. The last of these was Justice Kennedy in 1988. When the President made this nomination, he had more than 340 days left in his term. We are talking almost a quarter of the President's term. That is a lot more time than most of those 17 Justices had before this Senate. In the last 100 years, every nominee to a Supreme Court vacancy who did not withdraw--and a couple did--received a timely hearing and vote. On average, the Senate has begun hearings within 40 days of the President's nomination and voted to confirm 70 days after the President's nomination. There is no excuse for not holding a hearing and a vote. If that is what we are going to pay attention to in this Chamber and if that is what we are going to argue for--originalism, strict constructionism--the plain language of the Constitution is clear. There is a reason why no Senate has ever had the audacity to do what this Senate is doing right now--because of how clear that mission is and because there is no one else to do it. The Constitution says: The Senate shall advise and consent. It doesn't say: The House of Representatives shall have a role. It doesn't say: Let the people decide. It says that this is the Senate's job. We should do our job just as every Senate, until now, has done its job since the founding of the country, including the Senate that was there when George Washington was in office. Three of those 17 appointments were confirmed by a Senate that actually contained people who had been at the constitutional convention, and they were consistent with their understanding of what the Founders had agreed to. They had a vote on the floor of the Senate. I am not saying how people should vote. They should vote their conscience, but we should have a vote. The American people expect us to do our job. I want to be clear that I believe there should be hearings. I think we should go through hearings to establish the qualifications of the nominee. I think that is really important. The point I am making about having this vote does not have to do with whom the President nominated. It has to do with our institutional responsibility. It has to do with the rule of law and the image we want to project to our country and overseas. Finally, I have a word to say about the President's nominee. Merrick Garland is an honored and accomplished judge. Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet with him and learn about his judicial record and philosophy. I have known Chief Judge Garland for more than 20 years. I have actually worked for him at the Justice Department when we both worked for the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. I was fresh out of law school, but even then Judge Garland's humility, work ethic, and commitment to the rule of law inspired me and continue to inspire me. Our meeting last week confirmed what I already know. Judge Garland is an intelligent and pragmatic judge who is extraordinarily well- qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. I have wondered whether that is the reason the majority is not holding hearings. They could simply hold the hearings and vote against Judge Garland, which is their prerogative. Why not hold hearings? Maybe they know that the American people, given the opportunity to hear directly from Judge Garland, would see that he is precisely the type of judge who should serve on the Court. A vacancy on the Supreme Court is a rare thing. It doesn't come around very often. For those of us in this country, whether we are in the Senate or in a classroom somewhere, those vacancies, hearings, and debates on the floor present an unparalleled opportunity--a remarkable opportunity--for the American people to engage in a debate about the Court, the Constitution, and all kinds of issues that the Court will consider. That is what these hearings are about. That is what could be going on this summer during this Presidential election year, and we would have a discussion about where we want to head as a country. We are not having it. We are not having it because of this unprecedented action. Because of what the majority has done here, by not meeting with the nominee or holding a hearing, they are denying him the opportunity to make his case to the American people. In the meantime--and this is really critical--the Court will continue to be impaired. Impaired is the word that Justice Scalia himself used when he was asked to recuse himself from a case involving Dick Cheney, then the Vice President of the United States. In that case, he was asked if there would be a presumption of recusal. Justice Scalia's answer [[Page S2435]] to that was this: Maybe if I were on the court of appeals--because if I were on the court of appeals, there would be somebody to replace me, but that is not how it works on the Supreme Court. When there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, leaving the Court with only eight Justices, there is nobody who can fill in. There is nobody to become the ninth Justice. He said that the Court would therefore be impaired. The action that is being taken right now threatens to impair the Supreme Court not for one session but for two sessions of the Court before there is another election. In fact, for the third time since Justice Scalia's death, the Supreme Court could not resolve a dispute because of a 4-to-4 split. The longer this vacancy remains, the more uncertainty and confusion the American people will suffer. As I said, two terms of the Court will be jeopardized by petty politics. Believe me, I know it has become fashionable for Washington to tear down rather than work to improve the democratic institutions that generations of Americans have built, but to so cavalierly impair the judicial branch of our government is pathetic. It is time for the Senate to do its job as every Senate has done before us. Again, I am not asking my colleagues to support Judge Garland's nomination. That is a matter of conscience for each of us. But we must fulfill our basic constitutional obligation of holding a hearing and a vote. This is literally--because it is in the Constitution and no one else is granted this power--the least we can do to demonstrate that we are a legislative body that functions as the Constitution requires. We certainly have plenty of time. In view of that, if by contrast we leave for our scheduled 7 weeks of summer vacation--which is not enshrined in the Constitution but is a schedule that is set by the Senate--without having fulfilled our responsibility, the American people should demand that we return to Washington and do our job. It is past time for my colleagues to meet with Judge Garland, hold hearings on his record, and give the American people an up-or-down vote on this judicial vacancy. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority whip. The Appropriations Process Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I fear that sometimes here in the Senate we get bogged down in the minutia and the process and don't really talk about the why of how things are done here. We talk a lot about the how, but we don't talk about the why. I just want to speak for a couple of minutes about why it is so important that we pass the regular appropriation bills and put what we are trying to do here in a larger context. Our colleagues will remember that last year we were unable to pass the 12 regular appropriation bills because our Democratic colleagues filibustered those pieces of legislation in order to force a negotiation to raise the spending caps on discretionary spending. I regret that. I wish it hadn't happened, but it did and there is not much we can do about it. But in the process, what happened is that we ended up having to pass a fiscal year-end omnibus appropriations bill that lacked any basic transparency. There was about $1 trillion-plus worth of spending, and I think most people's reaction is this: Why do you have to do business in such a terrible way that lacks transparency, doesn't let people know what is in the bill, and doesn't let all 100 Senators contribute to the product? The reason is because our Democratic colleagues blocked those bills. I hope it is different this year because now those top-line numbers for discretionary spending are fixed in law. What we are trying to do, starting with the Energy and Water appropriations bill that Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein are working through the legislative process, is to begin the process of passing those regular appropriation bills. I hope and trust we will conclude with this piece of legislation this week and then we will move on to the next legislative vehicle, which will probably be the transportation, housing, and urban development legislation, the so-called THUD bill around here. We have actually demonstrated that by providing an open process, we can actually get some things done. We all recall last Congress--a year and a half ago. The fact of the matter is that a decision had been made by the then-majority leader, Senator Reid, not to allow Senators to participate in the amendment process on the floor. As a consequence, it wasn't just those of us in the minority who were prohibited from offering legislation that would actually improve the product that was on the floor, it included Members of his own political party. So they had to go home at election time and explain to their constituents back home: I may be in the majority, but I couldn't get an amendment voted on, on the Senate floor. Having learned from that experience, Senator McConnell and we decided that the best thing to do is to have an open process by which Members of the majority party and minority party, Democrats and Republicans alike--anybody who has a good idea--can come forward and get a vote on that legislation. We had a couple of recent bipartisan successes. Yes, I know in some corners ``bipartisanship'' is a dirty word, but the fact is, you can't get anything done around here unless it is bipartisan. Our Constitution was written in a way to force consensus to be built. In an absence of consensus, nothing gets done. So we have had a couple of recent successes, in addition to our work on appropriations bills, including the Energy Policy Modernization Act. One of the most important parts of that legislation from my perspective is that back in Texas we saw an expedited process for the approval of liquefied natural gas export terminals. That is very important to our economy and something that takes advantage of an incredible resource we have in America--natural gas--which we would like to sell to our allies and friends around the world when they don't have it. That is something that builds jobs in America. It helps grow our economy. It helps provide a lifeline to many of our allies around the world, for whom energy is being used simply as a weapon by people like Vladimir Putin. We also voted to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration bill. Obviously, this is important for public safety--to make sure our skies are safe--but also to provide the appropriate regulatory regime for the airline industry. Looked at individually, these bills may not seem like an end-all or be-all, but they are part of a bigger picture and part of a larger goal, which is getting this legislative body back to work again, as it was meant to do, considering and passing legislation that will impact our country for the better. Don't get me wrong. Sometimes the right answer is to stop bad ideas. Sometimes the right idea is to stop bad ideas, but where there is an opportunity for consensus and where we can actually craft something that helps move our country forward--I believe all 100 Senators came here with that sort of goal in mind. The bottom line is, we are working again to advance the priorities of the American people. In the same way we debate and discuss the Energy and Water appropriations bill, we have to keep the bigger picture in mind. It is not just about passing a single appropriations bill or to check items off our to-do list, it is part of a larger process, which is to fund the Federal Government in a fiscally responsible way, hopefully--that is our goal--and to make sure we review the programs that are funded by Federal appropriations and make sure they are still the priorities we believe they should be. If they aren't, then they shouldn't be funded. That is part of the process--to go back and look at what the programs are, whether they are still working, whether they are still necessary, and if they are not working or no longer necessary, then we simply no longer fund those as part of the appropriations process. We know this sets our country's priorities by giving guidance on everything we support--from our veterans to how we provide for our energy structure needs, to how we equip and train our troops. Funding the government is actually one of the most important and basic duties of the Congress. As the Senator from Tennessee has pointed out, one of the biggest problems we have--one we are not going to solve here today or this week, unfortunately--is that so much of the money [[Page S2436]] that gets spent by the Federal Government is on autopilot--so-called mandatory spending. In other words, it is not even subject to the appropriations process in the Senate. Currently, only about one-third of the money the Federal Government spends actually goes through this sort of transparent and open process, where everybody knows what is going on and can offer their input. The rest of the money is spent on autopilot, and it is projected to rise, according to one recent projection I saw, at a rate of roughly 5.3 percent over the next 30 years. We know that is far beyond the rate of inflation, and it is an unsustainable amount of spending. Some of the most important programs that are government funded, such as Medicare or Social Security, cannot be sustained at the current level of spending unless we do everything we can within our ability to shore them up and save them for the next generation. That is what we actually need to be doing in the larger picture. Until that day, we can continue to do what we can to deal responsibly with discretionary spending, and that is what we are trying to do. If we don't deal with these appropriations bills in a methodical and deliberate sort of way--all 12 of them--we are going to find ourselves at the end of September, at the end of the fiscal year, back in the same situation we were in last year--with the need for an omnibus appropriations bill or a continuing resolution, which is something I know there is not a lot of appetite for. Zika Virus Mr. President, let me just say a word about the Zika virus and the emergency funding request made by the President. Some of our colleagues--notably the Democratic leader and the Democratic whip-- talked about this this morning and raised the question of whether we are going to responsibly deal with this threat of the Zika virus. I can tell my colleagues we will. We are committed on a bipartisan basis to try to make sure we respond responsibly both from a public safety point of view and from a fiscal point of view. The President requested $1.9 billion. Thankfully, there is money that has been identified that was left over from the Ebola threat--some $500 million--that can be used as a downpayment to make sure our world-class scientists, like the ones I have met at the University of Texas medical branch in Galveston and just this last week at the Texas Medical Center, are doing the research that is necessary in order to identify how to stop this threat by controlling the mosquitoes that bring it into the country. We know the mosquito that carries the Zika virus is common in more temperate and warmer parts of the country, and that is why it has been primarily a threat in Brazil and places like Haiti and Puerto Rico. We also know that in places like Texas, Florida, and Louisiana, this mosquito is present and there are already established cases of Zika, primarily occurring in, I believe, either people who have traveled to Central America or South America and who have been bitten and brought it back with them or, in the case of--apparently it has now been discovered that this virus can be sexually transmitted. So one of the things we need to make sure of, particularly for every woman of child-bearing age, is that they get the sort of protection they need so these horrific birth defects that we have seen in the news don't occur. We are all committed to doing that. We also ought to make sure we don't overshoot our goal and write a blank check for something when we don't even know what the plan of attack is. In some ways, this is like the President asking us to fund a war without telling us what his strategy is for fighting and winning that war. I think that is the sort of commonsense question our constituents want us to ask, and which we should ask. I realize not everything is knowable. Hopefully, within a couple of years, our scientific community will have developed a vaccine which can protect people from this virus, but in the meantime we need to continue to fund the basic research. We need to continue to fund at the local level the mosquito eradication, and we need to keep our eye on this emerging threat. We can do that, and we will do that in a responsible sort of way. We don't need our colleagues on the Democratic side to say we have to do it right here, right now, without even having a plan from the administration on how we will fight and win this war against the Zika virus and hold up the regular appropriations process. I can tell from the saber-rattling going on from some of my colleagues across the aisle that they are looking for a reason to disrupt the regular appropriations process and that can be a mistake. First of all, it will not accomplish anything that can't otherwise be accomplished in terms of funding our research and the fight against the Zika virus. We are committed to doing that in a bipartisan sort of way but in a responsible sort of way that doesn't add to the national debt and pass the bill on to the next generation, as well as a proportional response to the threat. Just throwing money at it without a plan does not seem like a responsible thing to do. I implore our colleagues across the aisle, do not try to use the Zika crisis to hold hostage our ability to do our regular appropriations work. It is too important to avoid the year-end Omnibus appropriations bill that nobody says they like, and it is important for us to demonstrate--as we have tried to and I believe succeeded in doing, in large part--that we can continue to do our work day in and day out on a bipartisan, responsible basis, not that we are all going to agree on everything--that is just not the way people are built--nor do they want us to agree on everything. This is the place where we have the great debates on the issues that confront our country, both now and in the future, and that is appropriate. Nobody should take it personally. We need to have those debates. We need to have those verbal confrontations so we can get to the truth and figure the best path forward for the country. So we are not here to kick the can down the road. We are here to do the Nation's business, and we are here to deliver results to the American people. I hope we can continue to do that by carefully discussing, debating, and then voting on all 12 appropriations bills. In addition to talking about how, I hope to explain a little bit of the why it is so important that we do this now in order to avoid that year-end rush to an omnibus appropriations bill later on. Mr. President, I don't see any other Senators seeking recognition, so I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first, to the majority whip, I thank him for his comments on the Zika virus. He is absolutely right to raise awareness of that issue. It is a great concern. In Ohio we happen to have some military assets that have been used in the past for aerial spraying, and I know they are interested in being even more involved in some of the eradication of some of these mosquitoes in the southern part of the country that may end up causing some of this infection. It is a very serious matter, and I am glad to know the Appropriations Committee is working on it as well as our authorizing committees. I know the Senator from Texas has a personal interest in this. I rise to speak about the underlying legislation--the Energy and Water appropriations bill. I thank the chairman of that committee, Senator Alexander, for working with me to include a couple of important provisions for the State of Ohio. One is the cleanup of what is known as the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant. This is a site that for half a century enriched uranium. This uranium was used by our Navy, for our military, and for other purposes, including our nuclear arsenals, but it also has been used for our powerplants. So for decades the people in Piketon, OH, have been helping keep Americans safe and also helping thousands of Ohioans to keep the lights on and to stay warm at a reasonable cost. Now we have to clean up this facility. We moved on to other technology. It is an efficient [[Page S2437]] technology, but it is a heck of a cleanup removing all this gaseous diffusion material and properly disposing of it. This cleanup effort employs about 2,000 Ohioans. They are doing their job and doing it very well. We have to support them. Unfortunately, over the years they have not gotten the support they deserve. In a 2008 campaign trip to Ohio, the President gave a commitment that he would accelerate that cleanup. Frankly, that just hasn't happened under the President's budget, so every year we have to fight for more funding to be sure that we can continue the cleanup, which is so important, but also to ensure that we aren't losing jobs in Pike County. We just had this tragic occurrence where we had four different homes where family members were present during the horrible shooting out there in Pike County. This is one of the counties in Ohio that have relatively high unemployment. It is a county that has a lot of economic issues. These 2,000 jobs are good-paying jobs with good benefits, so it is very important that we keep the jobs there. Just as importantly, it is the right thing to do for the taxpayers because as the Obama administration has pulled back funding for this cleanup, it ends up costing the taxpayers more because delaying this cleanup ends up adding huge additional costs as funding is cut back and there is less cleanup going on. Our analysis shows that an accelerated cleanup could save the taxpayers $4 billion, getting this done and moving the site on to commercial use. Having adequate funding will save the taxpayers money. Second, cleaning up the radioactive waste and other hazardous waste there is incredibly important for the community. It makes that site cleaner, of course, and is better for the environment. It is important for the community and these people who have for many years been providing us with the enriched uranium for our military and for our powerplants to know they are not going to be left with this environmental problem. Third, these are good-paying jobs in a county that really needs them. Finally, we owe it to the community to clean up the site so they can redevelop it. They want to reindustrialize this site, and it is a great location to do maybe an energy project or maybe a nuclear powerplant at some point and other exciting opportunities, but they have to clean up what is there in order for the site to be used for that. The people of Piketon have helped shore up our economy and our national defense. We owe it to them to clean up this site. I am pleased that in this legislation we are considering an increase of $20 million over this year's level of cleanup work and an additional $20 million over this year's level for constructing a needed onsite disposal cell. We are at the point where we need to dispose of this material, and we need more money for that disposal cell. I am hoping that the House will increase the funding for the disposal cell even more, and if so, we will work in conference to get that number up further because that makes a lot of sense in order to actually move forward on this cleanup for all the reasons I have stated. Again, I thank the chairman, Senator Alexander, for his help on this. One thing the chairman knows well is that part of the funding for the cleanup work comes from the Department of Energy's barter of uranium. I ask that as we move forward with the completion of this legislation over the next few months, if the price of uranium should change--should drop--that the chairman continue to work with us to ensure that there are no job losses and to ensure that the cleanup work is not delayed as it has been in the past. Second, I thank the chairman for including another provision that is incredibly important to Ohio and to Lake Erie. For many years the Army Corps of Engineers has been dredging the Cuyahoga River. It is necessary to do that for commercial purposes. They have a big steel plant there, which anybody who comes to the Republican Convention will see. It is very important, for that plant and other commercial purposes, to keep this waterway open for boat traffic, including bringing iron ore in for the steel mills. Unfortunately, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wants to take the dredge from the river and dump it into Lake Erie. Time and time again, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and others have said this is not good for the environment. Specifically, the dredge has PCB material. The PCB pollutants get into the fish, and the Ohio EPA has told them that if they keep dumping it into the lake, at some point they will have to issue a warning that the walleye in Lake Erie, which is our great game fish, is not to be eaten more than a certain number of times per month. This would kill the fishing industry. It is also the wrong thing to do with all the algal bloom problems we have in the lake because that is driven by nitrogen and phosphorous mostly, and those nutrients would get into the lake through this dumping. So we are saying: Let's use an onsite disposal facility. We have one on land that they can use. They are refusing to do that. The Army Corps of Engineers has gone so far as to, in the last appropriations bill, actually cut their own funding--which is something I have never seen before--to not be able to meet the requirement we put into law, saying that they have to provide for the disposal of this product not into the lake but onto a land facility. We have now worked with Chairman Alexander to include language in this legislation before us. Senator Sherrod Brown and I were successful in getting that in last year. Once again we are working with the chairman to get that language in this year. I thank Senator Alexander for including it. It maintains the requirement that ensures that the Corps uphold its funding obligations to dispose of this dredge material upland and not in the lake. Again, it concerns me that the Corps seems to want to try to get around this. In fact, instead of putting money into the operations and maintenance account, as they are required to do to comply with not just what Congress says but, frankly, what the court has ordered them to do--because the court has consistently said they have to dredge and then dump on land, they have actually put that into a risky position by saying they don't need the funding. They have gone so far as to indicate that maybe other dredging projects on Lake Erie or other Lake Erie funding could be in jeopardy of not receiving the full amount of money they need if there is a need to dispose of this on land. There is a better way. The Corps should request use of unallocated funds provided by Congress in order to dispose of the dredge material at Cleveland Harbor safely without putting other projects at risk. They can do that. Our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, is currently investigating whether the Corps intentionally requested a decrease in funding in last year's spending bill so that they would have no choice but to dump this dredge material into the harbor. I hope that is not true. I hope we find out that is not what happened, but there are indications of that. Again, doing so would threaten the health of the area, the city of Cleveland, Lake Erie's ecosystem, and specifically our fishing industry in Lake Erie, which is so critical to economic growth in that area. Lake Erie is the most productive of all of our Great Lakes in terms of fishing. It has a $6 billion fishing industry and is the No. 1 tourist attraction in Ohio. I urge the Corps to revise its work plan for this year to request the additional funds necessary to safely dispose of the dredge sediment at the Cleveland Harbor during the 2016 dredging season if, as I suspect, the Federal judge again rules that the Corps cannot place it in Lake Erie. I urge them to work with us to come up with a solution so we can have this dredge material disposed of on land and actually recycle that material so that it has value. A couple of weeks ago when I was at the site, I saw how some of the material is being mixed with other fill and being used not just for landfill but also for gardens and for farming and agriculture purposes. This is a way to take the dredge and to actually have it have value and be able to recycle it. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to give this statement today and for his patience. I also thank Chairman Alexander and others who have worked with us on this so that we can indeed be sure that we clean up this site and that we are able to get this dredge material coming out [[Page S2438]] of the Cuyahoga River onto a site on land to avoid the environmental damage that would otherwise occur. I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Mr. SCHATZ. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 17 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman). Without objection, it is so ordered. Zika Virus Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I first want to talk about the Zika public health emergency that is coming to the United States of America. We have to act now to fund the administration's request of $1.9 billion in supplemental funding. Zika is a disease carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector that has already caused a dengue epidemic in my State of Hawaii. The Aedes mosquitoes are in more places than we previously thought throughout the United States. Zika is the first mosquito-borne illness to be associated with a congenital birth defect. We are continuing to learn more about this devastating disease every day, including its association with Guillain- Barre syndrome--a type of paralysis--eye abnormalities, and more. While there have not yet been any locally transmitted diseases of Zika in the continental United States, we do have hundreds of travel- related cases and up to 500 cases of active transmission in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As I mentioned, Hawaii is recovering from a dengue epidemic. So we must provide emergency funding for mosquito-borne illnesses, and we must do it now. This is an emergency. The administration has clearly laid out its request to combat Zika, which includes the following: $830 million for the CDC. This money would include grants and technical assistance to Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories and help our domestic and international response activities; about $250 million for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to increase the Federal match rate to Puerto Rico; and several hundred million dollars for the National Institutes of Health and BARDA to invest in vaccine research and development. That is the long-term solution. There is a high degree of competence that we will be able to get a vaccine but not without the funding. This is an absolute emergency. We need $10 million for the FDA vaccine and diagnostics development and review, which is absolutely critical--we don't have diagnostic tests that are quite as efficient and effective as we are eventually going to need--and $335 million for USAID efforts abroad in public health infrastructure. I was fortunate to visit the CDC in Atlanta a couple of weeks ago to learn more about their efforts to combat Zika, dengue, and other vector-borne diseases. I saw firsthand how the CDC has activated its Level 1 Emergency Operations Center to combat Zika. During my questions at the Labor-HHS appropriations hearings, I heard how the CDC is strapped for funds and has already programmed its Ebola funds and how these Ebola funds are critically needed to prevent another Ebola crisis. I have total confidence in the CDC, but they need this emergency funding request to be granted. We are about to go on a 1-week recess. There is no reason that we can't at least get on the supplemental this week. This is an absolute emergency. There are a lot of things we are doing that are important this week in terms of individual appropriations bills, but let's be clear: None of these appropriations bills are going to pass in the next week or even the next month. We still have the House that needs to take action, and there is no doubt we are going to go to conference. So in terms of whatever other legislative vehicles are pending or about to be pending, there is no urgency for us to move to those instead of what is happening right now in terms of a public health emergency with Zika. This is an absolute emergency. The reason this is not smashing through every headline online, on television, in the newspapers, and on the radio is that it is still cold outside in a lot of places and the mosquitoes haven't come out. This is about to be a very serious public health crisis. For those of us who have differing views about the size and scope of government, I just want to say this: We have arguments about the EPA's role, about the Department of Human Services' role, about the Department of Education's role, and the size and scope of government across the board, but can't we agree that government's basic job is to protect its citizens, and can't we agree that the CDC is one of the best agencies in the government across the board, and can't we agree that this is a real emergency and ought not to wait until May or June or July and ought to be taken up immediately? Mr. President, this is an emergency, and we ought to fund the supplemental on a big bipartisan vote. Trans-Pacific Partnership Mr. President, I would like to talk about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Many promises were made about the TPP. Before the final text was available, I received dozens of phone calls from advocates of the deal asking for my support. They said that this trade agreement was going to be different; that it would raise standards rather than lower them; and that my concerns about labor, the environment, climate change, public health, and consumer protection would be addressed. But since the text was released, I have read it, and unfortunately this deal does not turn out to be any different from the previous deals. It looks like just another race to the bottom. Proponents claimed that the labor and environment chapters would contain enforceable commitments, and I know a lot of people worked very hard to make that true. But when you look closely at the wording of these chapters, you see that the commitments are basically just strongly worded suggestions. There are very few requirements. Instead, the countries have promised to ``promote,'' ``encourage,'' ``cooperate,'' ``strive,'' and ``endeavor'' to do various things. I have no clue how one can enforce an obligation to encourage something or discourage something. Many of the provisions contain this weak language, carefully written by lawyers to be unenforceable. Here are a few examples from the environment chapter, which is particularly weak. First, the chapter opens with a general commitment that ``each Party shall strive to ensure that its environmental laws . . . provide for, and encourage, high levels of environmental protection.'' That is right; they are to ``strive to ensure.'' On transitioning to a low-emissions economy, ``Parties shall cooperate to address matters of joint or common interest.'' There is nothing more on climate change whatsoever. On marine animal conservation, ``Each party shall promote the long- term conservation'' of sharks and various marine animals through ``such measures'' considered appropriate. I don't even know what that means. What is clear is that none of this is enforceable. So the problem is, no accountability. There is no requirement that countries meet their obligations before Congress has to vote on the agreement and no independent verification of whether those obligations are ever met. We will vote to open our markets on day one to goods made under terrible labor and environmental conditions and hope that over time, after we have forfeited our leverage, these countries will implement and enforce the kinds of labor laws our country has had for decades. What this means is that we are giving them the deal, and after we forfeit all of our leverage, we hope they will see the light and do the right thing. Take Vietnam as an example. The economic benefits to Vietnam of reduced or eliminated U.S. duties are enormous. Importers from Vietnam currently pay around $2 billion in annual tariffs. Most of that comes from imports of apparel and footwear--industries that frequently utilize forced and child labor. Although Vietnam is supposed to comply on day one with the labor side agreement it signed with the United States, there is no independent verification. The side agreement sets up a long process of consultation before punitive action can be taken. At that point, Vietnam will already be enjoying the benefit of the elimination of the tariff, and the United States will have lost jobs that cannot compete [[Page S2439]] with forced child labor. No punitive action will bring back those jobs. Now let's talk about the enforcement side. Our track record, unfortunately, is not good. In the limited instances in which there are enforcement mechanisms in our trade agreements, we rarely utilize them. Recently, the GAO reported a systemic failure to enforce labor and environmental commitments across several trade agreements, even in light of compelling evidence of violations. The reason for this is that we don't really provide the resources for enforcement. But more importantly, there is a real lack of political will. For instance, the inclusion of Malaysia in this trade zone gives us insight into the lack of political will. When we debated fast-track authority last year, Congress agreed on an important negotiating objective: No trade deals with countries that earn the worst human trafficking ranking, according to the U.S. State Department. This seems like something everyone ought to agree to. At the time, this included Malaysia, which had the lowest ranking. But just after fast-track became law, Malaysia's ranking was upgraded--to the surprise of human rights experts everywhere. The upgrade allowed the circumvention of Congress's will and the continued inclusion of Malaysia in TPP. This came just a few months after the discovery of human cages and 130 graves at a human trafficking detention camp on the Malaysia-Thailand border. Against this backdrop, it is hard to have confidence that we will ever prioritize labor rights, human rights, or environmental protection over commercial interests. I am also deeply concerned about the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions, or ISDS for short. ISDS provides a special forum outside of our court system that is just available to foreign investors. These investors are given the right to sue governments over laws and regulations that impact their businesses--a legal right that is not granted to a labor union, an individual, or anyone else. Here is how it works: If a decision is made by a national government that is contradicted by a provision in a trade agreement, the trade agreement wins. If a law that we pass contradicts a provision in TPP, TPP trumps our law. Corporations are increasingly seeing this as a viable legal strategy to increase profits and undermine public health and environmental and labor protections. The ISDS forum is not available to anyone other than foreign corporations. It is not open to domestic businesses, labor unions, civil societies, or individuals who allege a violation of a trade agreement obligation. The arbitrators in ISDS who preside over these cases are literally not accountable to anyone. Their decisions cannot be appealed. By profession, the arbitrators usually make their living working as lawyers for multinational corporations. The arbitrators cannot force the government to change its laws, but they can order the government to pay the investor when they lose money as a result of a law that contradicts a trade agreement, which can have the same effect. It is one thing for the United States to decide to pay a penalty to keep a law in place, but small countries cannot afford to go up against these multinational corporations in the ISDS context. Not only will they repeal their national laws, they sometimes will not enact national laws knowing that they will be subject to fines under this ISDS process. The government often agrees to change the law or regulation that is being challenged, in addition to paying compensation. The threat of a case can be enough to convince a government to back away from legitimate public health, safety, or environmental policies. The practical implication is potentially sweeping. ISDS could prevent us from addressing climate change, raising the minimum wage, protecting consumers from harmful products, or preventing another financial crisis. Each time we pass a law or regulation to improve the lives of the American people, foreign investors will effectively have the final say. These risks are not theoretical. In fact, for the United States, the risk of ISDS has become very real. In January, TransCanada--the Canadian company behind the Keystone XL Pipeline--filed a claim against the U.S. Government under NAFTA's ISDS provisions for failing to approve the pipeline. If TransCanada wins, taxpayers--U.S. taxpayers-- would be on the hook for $15 billion in damages being demanded by foreign corporations. Make no mistake. This is a new strategy for fossil fuel companies to challenge laws and regulations that are attempting to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. There are hundreds of billions of dollars at stake, and with that on the line, you have to believe that law firms are spending hours systematically scouring every trade and investment agreement for provisions they can use to invalidate Federal law. This is the legal strategy to bust up laws designed to protect public health, the environment, and consumers. Corporate interests should not be the driving force for public policy decisions. Yet that is exactly what this trade agreement would allow. A lot of us had hopes that this trade agreement would be different, but in a lot of ways, it is the same as the bad agreements that have come before it, and in some ways, it is actually worse. We are forfeiting valuable leverage across a huge area of the Asia Pacific that we could have used to lift labor and environmental conditions and level the playing field for our workers. This is not a question of whether you are for trade or whether you believe we should be engaged in the Pacific region, it is a question of how. This deal is, unfortunately, a lowest common denominator agreement. For these reasons, I must oppose the TPP. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Wyoming. The Republican-Led Senate Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I head home to Wyoming just about every weekend. Lots of people from Wyoming come here to Washington to visit as well. When I am home, I get a chance to talk to people, and here in Washington, I get to talk to people. So yesterday is a day I flew here. I had talked to folks in Wyoming early in the morning and then yesterday afternoon got off the plane, and there were a number of students here from Sheridan High School from ``We the People.'' One of our pages here is also from that high school. So you get to hear a lot from people. Some folks have been asking: What has the Republican Congress actually accomplished? So I would like to take a few minutes to talk a little bit about what the Senate has actually done this year and during this Congress since the Republicans have taken over the majority. We are not even 4 months into this year, and we have already had a very productive year in the Senate. It is true. We have been active, we have been effective, and it is only April. In February, we passed legislation to add tough new sanctions against North Korea. As the Presiding Officer knows, the President in the White House was very reluctant when we started proposing these sanctions-- hesitant about the sanctions that we proposed against North Korea. Let's face it. North Korea has been aggressively testing missiles, testing nuclear weapons, and needs to be stopped. When other countries threaten their neighbors, as North Korea has done in their general geographic area, what happens is the United States must stand up and stop them. President Obama has done far too little. I am very concerned about the aggression and the ambitions of North Korea. That is why the Senate had to act. So Congress has stood up and pushed against this action. We had more action against North Korea; that is exactly what we did. The Senate also acted by passing a Defend Trade Secrets Act to help businesses protect their confidential information. We passed a piece of legislation called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation to help fight the misuse of prescription drugs, in terms of prescription pain killers called opioids. Now, look, it has been a huge problem in our country-- communities all around the country. Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire and Senator Portman of Ohio were two of the main sponsors of this legislation. I know [[Page S2440]] Senator Portman was on the floor recently, talking about different legislation. But he has shown heroic leadership in an area that certainly needed to be addressed. The Senate worked and reauthorized the Older Americans Act. This was another bipartisan piece of legislation. It works to help provide senior citizens with things like meals, transportation--ways to help people live in their own homes longer and ways to help in terms of their quality of life, which is very important for Americans all across the country. We passed legislation to overhaul and reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. This is a significant accomplishment. This legislation promotes U.S. aerospace jobs by cutting through some of the redtape that has been hurting airplane designers. Then, just last week, we passed a comprehensive overhaul of American energy policy, something we had not done in about 8 years. Over the past few years, hard-working Americans have made this country into an energy superpower. Yet we had not passed any kind of major energy legislation for about 8 years because Washington's regulations have simply not kept pace, and they have actually worked against the energy producers, people that are getting back to work, getting this country's economy returned. The legislation we passed is going to rein in some of this needless, wasteful bureaucracy that the Federal Government has imposed on the people creating energy jobs and working to produce more energy because energy is called a master resource for a reason. We have it in great abundance. One of the very important parts was language to expedite the shipment of America's natural gas to buyers around the world. It is good for our economy, and it is good for our allies who will be able to decrease their dependence on Russian gas. Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska did an outstanding job of making sure that this legislation had ideas from both sides of the aisle. That is a big part of why this piece of major energy legislation--first time in 8 years--passed 85 to 12--85 to 12. That is another big accomplishment of the Senate this year that does not get enough attention. It is not just that we are passing important legislation that helps Americans, but we are doing it in a bipartisan way that allows every Senator--every Member of this body--to represent the people back home with their ideas and their suggestions. We have voted on 129 amendments so far this year--129 amendments voted on this year. When the Democrats under Harry Reid were in control, a lot of people around here got used to the idea that people did not actually get to vote on amendments. In 2014, the last year under Democratic control under Harry Reid, the Senate had only 15 up- or-down votes on amendments all year--full calendar year 2014. When Republicans took the majority, we changed that. The Senate has been working this year just as we worked last year. We could have done a lot more if a few Democrats had not blocked progress on some very important pieces of legislation. The people in Wyoming now know that there are some important things they really care about, and they were actually blocked by President Obama. In January, the President vetoed legislation that we had passed to improve health care in this country by repealing major parts of ObamaCare. Remember, the President said to Democrats that they should forcefully defend and be proud of that health care law, but one out of four Americans--25 percent of Americans--say they have been personally harmed by the President's health care law. So we put it on his desk to do a repeal, and he vetoed that. Now, only about one in eight people in this country say they have been helped by the health care law. When you take a look at major legislation that impacts the country, it is no surprise that this health care law continues to be very unpopular, especially when you see that for every one person who says they have been helped, there are almost two people who said they have personally been hurt by the law. The President also vetoed legislation that we passed here to bring some sanity to something called the waters of the United States rule-- again, a rule put out in regulation by the President, a reinterpretation of the law. The law is very clear to me, but the President had his own approach. We put a bill on his desk to overturn what he has tried to do. The courts have actually stopped him in his tracks, but he once again vetoed our efforts. Last year the President actually vetoed five different bills passed by Congress. This kind of obstructionism from President Obama doesn't help our country move forward. It is not helpful when the Democratic leaders do everything they can to convince people that nothing is being done in the Senate, but we hear that day after day from Minority Leader Harry Reid. It is interesting, because when Senator Reid was the majority leader, he had a very firm strategy, and the strategy seemed to be to do as little as possible. Well, he is now the minority leader, and I think he went from the majority to the minority for a reason. It seems to me that he is still hanging on, clinging on to that losing strategy. The plan didn't work then, and I think that one of the reasons that he continues to try to talk down and slow down some of our progress is because, actually, he is envious--envious of anyone who gets things done in the Senate. Republicans in the Senate are not interested in working at Harry Reid's pace and neither are the Democrats--many of the Democrats. Most Senators agree that we have a lot of work to do and that it is good for America when we actually do the work. That is why we have been working our way through the appropriations bills. This year we got the earliest start ever to appropriations bills--and really in the history of the modern budget process. So we continue to work on that. I wish to be clear on one important point. Doing our job in the Senate doesn't mean setting aside the priorities of the American people just to help President Obama build a political legacy. That is why the Senate is going to stand firm and strong to give Americans a voice in who gets to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Now President Obama wants us to set aside everything else and let him appoint his Justice to the Supreme Court. It is not going to happen. We do our job every day, doing the things that will make an immediate difference to the families all across the country, things that Republicans and Democrats agree on and that everybody knows we should be doing. That is what you are seeing with this Republican-run Senate. That is what the people want us to do. That is what they expect us to do, and that is what we will continue to do. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 20 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Climate Change Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today is the 135th time I have come to give voice to the issue that I feel will most significantly define this generation of leadership in the United States and, frankly, around the globe. I know that there are many people in Washington who would prefer to ignore what our carbon emissions are doing to our oceans and to our climate, but we disregard nature's warnings at our peril. The changes to our environment, fueled by our carbon pollution, are far-reaching--from the coastlines to the prairies, from mountain tops to deep oceans, from pole to pole. As a terrestrial species, we naturally pay more attention to what is happening on land, such as increasing average global temperatures and upheavals in extreme weather. We don't so much see what is happening in our oceans. Every year we emit into the Earth's thin atmosphere tens of gigatons of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels--nearly 36 gigatons of carbon dioxide in 2014. Not all of that carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere. Our oceans--the Earth's oceans--absorb approximately one- third of all our carbon pollution. That means they have absorbed roughly 600 gigatons in our industrial era. For the record, a gigaton is a billion tons--not a thousand tons, not a million tons, but a billion tons--and 600 [[Page S2441]] billion tons of carbon dioxide have gone into our oceans. We know what that does. All that carbon dioxide in the oceans changes the ocean's very chemistry, and it makes ocean water more acidic. The chemical reaction, carbon dioxide reacting with water to form carbonic acid, is simple. You can replicate it in a middle school science lab, but its effects in the oceans are profound. According to research published in the journal Nature Geoscience, the rate of change in ocean acidity is already faster than at any time in the past 50 million years on Earth. We are rapidly spiraling into unknown territory. By way of context, the human species has been around on Earth for about 200,000 years. The human species started farming and herding, went from hunting and gathering to the basics of socialized human life less than 20,000 years ago. We are doing something to our planet now that has no precedent for 50 million years. This line shows the increasing CO 2 in the atmosphere in parts per million. This line shows the absorption of the CO 2 by the ocean, and this line shows the pH change in the oceans as a result. I would point out that pH is actually measured on a logarithmic scale. So if you were to adjust this to the standard percentage-type display of information, you would see this falling much more steeply. This is a very conservative way of showing what is happening to our oceans. The logarithmic scale is a multiple, not just a steady line. So as you move down the pH numbers, you are actually creating much more massive effects in the ocean. People have measured this drop in ocean pH from climate change. This is not a theory. You can go out and measure it with equipment that is not very different, again, from what a middle school with an aquarium would use to measure pH in the aquarium. People measure something else in our oceans also. They measure the rise in ocean temperature. For decades, the oceans have absorbed over 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gas emissions. The heat that comes in, that gets trapped in our thin atmosphere when the Sun's warmth gets trapped by these greenhouse gasses, lands in a variety of places. The Antarctic ice sheet gets two- tenths of a percent of the heat. The Greenland ice sheet gets two- tenths of a percent of the heat. Arctic sea ice gets eight-tenths of a percent of the heat. Glaciers and icecaps take up nine-tenths of a percent of the heat. All of our continents together, the land mass of the Earth, take up 2.1 percent of the added heat from climate change. The atmosphere, that thin membrane that allows us to live and breathe on this planet, has taken up 2.3 percent of the heat. All the rest of it, 93 percent, has been taken up by the oceans. They are our refrigerant. They are our cooler. They are the air conditioner for the planet. But when you take up that much, things begin to change, and ocean heat is ramping up. A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that in the last 20 years--actually, less than 20, from 1997 to now, to be exact--the oceans absorbed the same amount of heat energy just in that 20-year period as they had in the previous 130 years. That is a dramatic increase in heat uptake by the oceans. It is our human activity, specifically our unfettered burning of fossil fuels, that has made our oceans both warmer overall and more acidic. One result of this is the calamity now taking place in the world's coral reefs. A healthy coral reef is one of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on Earth. It is an engine for the propagation of life. Coral depends on a symbiotic relationship with tiny, photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae. They live in the surface tissue of the coral. Within a limited range of temperature, pH, salinity, and water clarity, this symbiosis can thrive, and it gives us reefs all over the world--these engines of life in the ocean. Living coral has evolved for millions of years to maintain its symbiosis within that range. We are now measurably--not theoretically but measurably--altering the ocean in ways too fast for coral to adapt. Push corals out of their comfort range for very long, and the corals get stressed and they evict their algae. This process is what is known as coral bleaching. Because corals get most of their food out of that symbiotic relationship with these algae, if the algae can't be reabsorbed quickly, the corals die. Coral bleaching sounds benign, but it is like cardiac arrest for a reef. There is a good chance it dies and, even if it doesn't, it is a long recovery. We are currently in the middle of a massive bleaching of the world's coral reefs--cardiac arrest at a global scale. Dr. Mark Eakin of NOAA's Coral Reef Watch Program says of this coral cataclysm: ``It very well may be the worst period of coral bleaching we have seen.'' And when he says ``we have seen,'' he means that which we have ever seen in the human record. Worldwide, coral has already declined by approximately 40 percent. Closer to home, across the Caribbean and the Florida Keys, two key coral species have declined by an astonishing 98 percent in the last four decades. In my lifetime, I have seen once-radiant underwater ecosystems teeming with life become barren fields of white skeletons reaching into an empty ocean. One of my climate trips took me down to Monroe County, FL, where I met Mayor Sylvia Murphy, the Republican mayor of Monroe County, home to the famous Florida Keys. I asked her how the reefs were off the Keys. ``Beautiful,'' she said, ``unless you were here 15 years ago.'' Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral ecosystem on Earth. It is one of the seven wonders of the natural world. Severe bleaching is now hitting ``between 60 and 100 percent of corals'' on the Great Barrier Reef, according to Dr. Terry Hughes of James Cook University in Queensland, Australia. Professor Hughes tweeted out a map of the current devastation, writing in the text: ``I showed the results of aerial survey of bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef to my students, and then we wept.'' As with many other effects of climate change, it can be difficult to convey the magnitude of events when they aren't taking place in front of our terrestrial human faces. In his 2010 TED talk, one of the great marine scientists we have, leading coral ecologist Dr. Jeremy Jackson, tried to bring this coral bleaching calamity a little closer to home. He put it like this: Imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or North America, and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you, and you see that 80 percent of the trees, as far as you can see, have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked. And you come home, and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves. Remember, this is his example from July. And then you read in the paper a few weeks later, ``Oh, by the way, a quarter of those trees died.'' Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino, an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe, when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died. Jeremy came to speak to our caucus recently. He told us that every ocean ecosystem he studied in his career is gone, as he first found it, changed dramatically from his first visit. Coral reefs are one of the first places that truly irreversible effects of climate change seem to be manifesting themselves--the proverbial canary dying in the coal mine of our carbon-ridden planet. To say the ocean we knew in our childhood is already gone is not doomsaying or pessimism, it is a grimly realistic assessment of where we stand, sadly. In the Senate, there will likely be snickering about this. Some will say: Who gives a damn about coral reefs? If it can't be monetized by a corporation, the hell with it, is too often our motto here. Well, God made these glories. God made them on our planet. In some cases, they have been growing for tens of thousands of years. We are wrecking them in a single generation, and if that doesn't mean something to us, a long look in the mirror might be in order. Even those who can only see this tragedy through their monetizer goggles ought to know that a decline in healthy coral reefs is a huge blow to us all. According to an article last month in The Atlantic, coral reefs are home to 25 percent of the world's fish biodiversity. Reefs are incubators for ocean life, support systems for fisheries we depend on, tourist attractions for divers and snorkelers who fill local communities with their visiting and [[Page S2442]] their spending, and they are coastal protection for coastal infrastructure and homes against storm waves. It is not nice to fool with Mother Nature. As Pope Francis warned, ``God always forgives; mankind sometimes forgives; nature never forgives. You slap her and she will slap you back.'' As he says, we are sinning with our actions against nature, and nature will not forget. We just don't have that right. We are making a mark on the Earth in this generation that will not go away. If mankind lasts 10,000 years, well, 10,000 years from now they will see and know the mark of this generation on our planet, and they will justly inquire: How could we have been such fools? How could we, in this generation, have been such greedy, reckless, self-infatuated fools? In 1954, the United States detonated a hydrogen bomb over the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The explosion vaporized everything on three islands, raised water temperatures to as much as 55,000 degrees, and left a crater over a mile wide and 240 feet deep. More than 60 years have gone by and scientists observe the corals in this part of the Pacific flourishing again. If you give it a chance, life finds a way. Dr. Zoe Richards, one of the scientists involved in the study, said: ``The healthy condition of the coral at Bikini Atoll today is proof of their resilience and ability to bounce back from massive disturbances, that is, if the reef is left undisturbed and there are healthy nearby reefs to source the recovery.'' So that is the caveat. Reefs can recover but not if we continue to stack the deck oceanwide against them by pumping so much heat and carbon pollution into the oceans. Senator Schatz of Hawaii--not coincidently another ocean State-- introduced, along with me, the American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act last year to address climate change with a market-based solution built on principles espoused by leading Republican economists. We went to Republicans--former Cabinet officials, former Members of Congress, economists, think tanks--and we said: How should we do this? If you don't like the President's plan, if you don't like the regulatory way, what is your way? Virtually every single person on the Republican side who has thought this problem through to a solution has come to the same place, a revenue-neutral carbon fee with an appropriate border adjustment. So that is what we wrote. When you are ready, we are here. We did it your way. As a Senator, John F. Kennedy once said: Let us not despair but act. Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past--let us accept our own responsibility for the future. This is particularly true for our oceans. As one Florida mayor put it: ``The ocean is not Republican, and it's not Democratic . . . it's a nonpartisan ocean,'' and that nonpartisan ocean is screaming warnings at us that we ought to heed in nonpartisan fashion. We have a clear scientific understanding of the problem, and we have a moral obligation to act. Time is not on our side. We need to pay attention to the evidence. We need to accept the reality of our predicament as it is communicated to us by the laws and signs of nature--God's signals to us on this Earth. That is what healthy coral looks like under the water. Here it is bleached out and dying. It is our ocean. It is our responsibility. I urge this body to wake up and lead. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Tribute to Dr. Emily Lembeck Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to do something I periodically like to do when a citizen of my State deserves recognition for the contributions they have made to my State and the citizens of my State. Today is such a day. Dr. Emily Lembeck is the superintendent of the Marietta City Public School System. Recently, she was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Education, and her palm print is embedded in the walk around Glover Park Square in Marietta, GA. I am close to Emily in more ways than one. When I chaired the State board of education in 1996, she was an elementary school principal at Dunleith Elementary in Marietta, GA. She had been at West Side, she moved on to Marietta Middle School, and later became superintendent of the Marietta Public Schools--8,900 students, 1,200 employees--a challenge but a wonderful community. Throughout her career, she has gifted more to children in our community than any person I know of. In particular, she has taught those who didn't know how to read to read. She has made reading a passion in our community. She has made children's ability to read and comprehend and understand and move forward in life a reality, in a place where at one time it was no reality at all. In fact, let me tell you, when I was chairman of the State board of education we were working hard to make Reading First a movement in this country. She came forward with this idea about adopting something called Marietta Reads. It was a very simple program but a program where leaders in the community, such as I, would come to elementary schools in Marietta, GA, sit down ``Indian style'' on the floor with first graders and teach them to read, read with them, and help them identify with the joy of reading and the understanding of reading. From that day, I gained a greater appreciation for the challenge every teacher faces as they teach our children in classrooms. Emily Lembeck has been awarded almost every award you can possibly get, from the chamber of commerce to the Kiwanis Club, to the Rotary. She has received the Living the Dream Award from the NAACP during King Week a few years ago, she received the Whitney M. Young Jr. Service Award from the Boy Scouts for her leadership. Time and again, Emily Lembeck has been represented to be the great person she is--a leader in education, a leader of children, somebody our community is proud of. So on this day in Washington, DC, on the floor of the Senate, I want the name of Emily Lembeck to ring from one corner to the other for all she has contributed and all she has done to make our community a better, more wholesome, and more meaningful community, and for what she has done to make the lives of our community's children just a little bit better. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Indian Health Service Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, for years now, patients on Indian reservations in the Great Plains area have been receiving substandard medical care. The most recent example of the Indian Health Service's failure occurred in December of 2015, when I was notified that two federally operated Indian Health Service facilities in my State were at risk of losing their Medicare provider agreements. In other words, these two facilities have been delivering such a poor level of care, the government isn't sure it is willing to continue paying these facilities to care for Medicare patients. In February, at the request of several Senators, myself included, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing to address the state of patient care at the Indian Health Service in the Great Plains area. Thanks to the graciousness of our colleague from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, who chairs the Indian Affairs Committee, I was able to participate in this hearing and question several Indian Health Service officials. I wish I could report that this hearing reassured me that the Indian Health Service is on track to solve the problems facing patients on the reservations, but it just left me more concerned. The hearing underscored the government's massive failure on this issue: its failure to deliver quality care, its failure to ensure patient safety, and its failure to live up to treaty responsibilities. [[Page S2443]] I have read the reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and some of the stories really are beyond comprehension. Incredibly, a report of dirty, unsanitized medical equipment left exposed in an emergency room isn't even the most shocking of those stories. One patient who had suffered a severe head injury was discharged from the hospital mere hours after checking in, only to be called back later the same day when his test results arrived. The patient's condition was so serious that he was immediately flown to another facility for care. One health service facility was in such disarray that a pregnant mother gave birth on a bathroom floor--a bathroom floor--without a single medical professional nearby, which shockingly wasn't the first time this had happened at this facility. I wish I were able to stand here today and report that conditions are getting better. Unfortunately, I cannot. Since February's hearing, we have been made aware of another tragic event that occurred at Pine Ridge Hospital. Reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services indicate that a 23-year-old patient complaining of nausea and cramping in his hands and lower extremities died from cardiac arrest 2 hours after he was discharged from the emergency department. An investigation conducted by CMS verified that this young man failed to receive an adequate medical screening evaluation before his discharge. Even worse, the report indicated that there was no documentation showing nurse and doctor communication. It hasn't helped that Congress's attempts to address these problems have been hampered by less-than-honest reporting from the Indian Health Service. Time and again, we have found that conditions on the ground have not matched up to information reported to Congress. In 2014, I requested a status update from the then-Acting Director of the Indian Health Service. In her response, she stated that ``the Great Plains Area has shown marked improvement in all categories'' and that ``significant improvements in health care delivery and program accountability have also been demonstrated.'' Significant improvements? Sending a man home with bleeding in his brain and having a mother give birth prematurely on a bathroom floor are not signs of significant improvements. On December 4, 2015, officials from the Indian Health Service stated that a majority of the concerns at Rosebud Hospital had been addressed or abated. Yet, mere hours later, I was informed that the Rosebud Hospital emergency department was functioning so poorly that emergency patients would be diverted to other hospitals beginning the next day. It has now been 143 days, and the Indian Health Service leadership has been unable to reopen the Rosebud Hospital's emergency department. For the last 143 days, incoming emergency patients have had to travel between 44 and 55 miles to receive care. That is similar to requiring a resident of Harpers Ferry, WV, to travel to Washington, DC, to receive emergency services. And to date, the Indian Health Service has been unable to tell us when it anticipates emergency department services will resume. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe informs me that since this emergency department has been on diverted status, six individuals have lost their lives in ambulances while being transported to a hospital farther away. Six families are now left to wonder whether their loved ones could have been saved if the Indian Health Service had been doing its job. This is unconscionable. The Indian Health Service has one last chance this Friday to reach an agreement with CMS to set the Rosebud Hospital back on a path to compliance with basic safety and administrative requirements. If the Indian Health Service fails to do so, Rosebud will lose its status as a Medicare provider. Additionally, the Indian Health Service has until Friday to address Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act violations found at Pine Ridge Hospital. The administration has drafted report after report promising to correct these issues, yet time and again it has failed to follow through. During the recent Indian Affairs Committee hearing, the former Principal Deputy Director of the Indian Health Service could not remember that he was in charge of implementing a 2011 report. Where is the accountability? Who is in charge? We have got to do better. Simply shifting staff between positions and offices, as the Indian Health Service has done in response to these problems, is not enough. It is time for action. We must do everything within our power--we will do everything within our power--to hold the Indian Health Service accountable and to make sure this never happens again. I continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate on a path forward to demand accountability from an agency that, by all accounts, is disconnected and unresponsive to the needs of our Native Americans. I will also continue to consult with the nine tribes in South Dakota. Our tribes are in the best position to help figure out the path forward for their own health care, and I believe the Indian Health Service must do a better job of consulting with our tribes when it comes to the care they receive. I am going to do everything I can within my power to get all of our tribal citizens the quality care they deserve. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The remarks of Mr. Burr pertaining to the introduction of S. 2854 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. BURR. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the one in three Ohioans who knows somebody who is struggling with addiction to heroin or prescription drugs. I rise today on behalf of the over 5,000 Americans who have lost their lives to a prescription drug overdose since the Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act back on March 10. I rise today to talk about an epidemic which is affecting my home State of Ohio, which is affecting all our States, whichever it is, and which is affecting our country and must be dealt with. This is the fourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate since we passed CARA, which is the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, and I come to floor to talk about our legislation and to ask the House of Representatives to please pass that legislation, which would then go to the President for his signature and could begin to help in communities all across the country. The legislation I am talking about is legislation that the Senator from New Hampshire, now who is the Chair right now, the Presiding Officer, has been involved with in a very deep way in her own State of New Hampshire and also here on the Senate floor. I appreciate all the hard work she has put into this, and I know she agrees with me that it is time for the House to act. We passed it on March 10. That means it has been 47 days since the Senate acted. About 120 Americans die every day of a drug overdose. It has been 47 days. That means we have lost 5,600 Americans to drug overdoses since the Senate passed this bill. By the way, it is not just about that tragic loss of life, it is about so many people who may not have overdosed but have this addiction and are not taking care of their families, are not able to work and be a productive citizen, are not achieving their God-given potential. It is about those who have overdosed but have been saved by this miracle drug that police and firefighters and other first responders and sometimes family members now are administering called Narcan or naloxone. It means that since the Senate passed this bill, this epidemic is getting worse, not better. That is based on [[Page S2444]] all of the information I get back home. Last week in Lebanon, OH--it is a small town north of Cincinnati, OH, where my family has roots going back to the 1920s--in Lebanon, OH, a 34-year-old woman, who was engaged to be married, overdosed and died in front of her children, one aged 10 and one baby girl who was still learning to walk. By the way, that little girl's father has now been arrested. Within days of her mother's addiction--she has now lost both her mom and her father. Last week, from Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday morning--Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday morning--six people died of overdoses in one small town called Elyria, OH. It is not a big city; there are about 53,000 people in Elyria. We lost six people in 24 hours. That does not include the 14 people who were saved by this miracle drug I talked about, Naloxone, that reverses the effects of an overdose. That is what has been happening. That is happening on our streets, and in the case of my home town of Cincinnati, it is happening in our parking lots. At noontime on Sunday, in my hometown, a man overdosed in the parking lot of the Museum Center in Cincinnati, OH. First responders moved quickly and were able to save his life. But it is happening in broad daylight, unfortunately, more and more frequently. Since 2007 drug overdoses have killed more people in Ohio than car accidents, making it the No. 1 cause of accidental death. I am told that nationally, now, it is the leading cause of accidental death in the country. It is not car accidents, which we would might have assumed, it is overdoses. They have more than tripled in Ohio from 1999 to 2010. We are told that 200,000 Ohioans are addicted to opioids--200,000 people. That is the size of a major city like Akron, OH. That is something which should concern us all. Last week there was a poll that showed that 3 in 10 Ohioans know someone who has abused prescription drugs, and 1 in 8 knows someone who has overdosed. We are talking about more than 1.3 million Ohioans. According to NIDA--the National Institute on Drug Abuse--the United States, even though we make up about 5 percent of the world's population, consumes 75 percent of the prescriptions drugs, including the vast majority of the world's prescription painkillers, the narcotic painkillers. They say four to five of the people who are heroin addicts started on prescription drugs. We have heard more about this this week in the news, about the fact that so many people get addicted to the opioid, which is the prescription drug. Sometimes it is actually prescribed to them; sometimes they obtain it illegally. They turn to heroin as a less expensive alternative and then end up overdosing. The results are tragic. If this is not an epidemic, I don't know what is. It is affecting every area. It knows no ZIP Code. So when you think about drugs and drug abuse and the effects of it, you might think inner city. That is not so. It is everywhere--in the suburbs, in the rural areas. It knows no ZIP Code. I mentioned that this legislation we worked on here for a few years passed the Senate. It was bicameral legislation, meaning it was the House and Senate working together for 3 years. We had five conferences here in Washington. We brought in experts on the issues of prevention and education and treatment and recovery and how to deal with our veterans who are coming back, who have a high rate of addiction, how to deal with women and their babies. In my home State of Ohio, we have had a huge increase in the rate of babies being born addicted, and what do you do about that? We put together this legislation in a comprehensive manner to handle not just one part or one sector but to be something that would deal with the holistic approach so that we could actually get at this issue. In the House, by the way, the identical legislation was introduced, and they now have over 120 cosponsors of that legislation in the House. Yet they have not been able to move on that legislation. Instead, they are moving on other legislation to deal with the issue. That is good. I am sure there are a lot of other things that can and should be done. Some of what they are doing is consistent with CARA. But we know CARA works. We know that if we can pass it, the President would sign it. We know it would help immediately in our communities. So I again call on the House to move quickly. Last week a subcommittee in the House chaired by Joe Pitts marked up one dozen bills that have to do with how we fight this epidemic. Joe Pitts is a man who cares a lot about this issue. He has a passion for it. This week my friend and full committee chairman Fred Upton is going to mark up those 12 bills. The House has a lot of good ideas. That is fine. That is good. I joined Congressman Bill Johnson of Marietta, OH, who has been a passionate advocate on this issue, to introduce something called the Preventing Abuse of Cough Medicine Act, which would restrict the sale of certain cough medicines that are frequently abused. That is good. It is a commonsense Ohio idea. I thank my friend and colleague for doing his part to help our constituents. That should be passed in addition to CARA, along with other legislation. I certainly respect my colleagues over there very much, as I said, but let's just give CARA a vote, and then let's move on this other legislation as well. It takes a while, as all of us are painfully aware, to get something through the process around here. This one went through with a 94-to-1 vote. It is comprehensive. It was introduced in both the House and the Senate. They have over 120 cosponsors. Let's just move that. Then, if there are other things to be dealt with, like the one I talked about, we can work on those as well and find ways to work together to find common ground. I will support that. I cannot speak for all of my colleagues, but I can speak for all of them--with the exception of one who voted the other way--to say that we will help get CARA to the President. In fact, it doesn't need to come back to the Senate if they pass the CARA legislation. More and more Members in the House are focused on this issue. That is good. Tomorrow, the House Judiciary Committee is also marking up legislation in this area. So this is a separate committee--the Energy and Commerce Committee--and now the Judiciary Committee. They are going to mark up five related bills, including what they consider the alternative to CARA. It has some of the CARA provisions but not all of them. Let me tell you what the experts out there are saying. There are over 120 groups who have endorsed our legislation, helped us to get our legislation through. Yesterday, the policy director of the Harm Reduction Coalition sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee saying that its alternative ``omits vital provisions in CARA addressing recovery, collateral consequences, prevention, and education. These omitted provisions represent critical community priorities, which truly relate to the comprehensiveness of CARA's approach. CARA was developed through a thorough process of extensive consultation with dozens of stakeholders . . . and has secured the broad support of national, state, and local addiction and recovery, public health, and criminal justice organizations. . . . The version of CARA passed by the Senate represents substantial consensus among both community stakeholders and bipartisan lawmakers.'' The House Judiciary's alternative to CARA does contain some of CARA's best proposals. I appreciate that. But unfortunately it dropped out a number of really important ones as well. Some of the most important ideas that are missing include provisions expanding drug takeback programs. Again, we talked about this earlier. These prescription drugs are at the heart of this problem. These takeback programs get these prescription drugs off the bathroom shelf, allow us to pull these drugs away from our communities so that people are not using these drugs to get into more drugs, to get into heroin. That is not in there. There is also a heroin law enforcement task force that was dropped out and a drug court for veterans called the veterans court. That is a very important issue for all of us. The veterans' testimony we got made it clear to us that these courts are working. I have toured some of these courts. I have had a chance to sit down at a roundtable discussion in Ohio with one of our [[Page S2445]] great veterans courts to talk to veterans whose lives have been entirely turned around by these veterans courts. After years and years of bouncing around in the prison system or at the VA, finally they get into these drugs courts for veterans, where they are surrounded by other veterans and they are able to pull their lives together, to get their families back together, and in one case go back to school. There is one guy who is about to graduate from Ohio State University after years and years of not being able to find a way to move forward. Here is another one. Patty McCarthy Metcalf of Faces and Voices of Recovery wrote in a letter today that taking out the CARA recovery provisions ``will prolong the crisis of addiction by not providing the critical support in communities across our nation where it is most needed. Recovery services provided by recovery community organizations, including recovery coaching and emergency rooms and drug courts and recovery education and awareness, are desperately needed and highly effective in getting people with addiction on a long-term path to recovery.'' What does she mean by all that? She means that these recovery coaches and the services that are supported by the CARA bill help people who might go, as she said, to an emergency room because they have an overdose to be confronted by somebody who says: Look, we can help you get better. You don't have to do this again. You don't have to overdose again. You don't have to go through this near-death experience. We can get you into a program where you can get treatment and recovery. Someone has to provide the resources for those coaches. We want those coaches. All of us as citizens should want them. We don't want people to keep overdosing again and again. We want to break that cycle. That is what our legislation would do. Patty makes the critical point that our response has to be comprehensive. I think she is right. She says: Prevention, treatment and enforcement cannot solve the opiate problem without recovery supports. National experts on addiction, and millions of people in recovery, will agree that a comprehensive approach is critical. That is what we do. CARA is comprehensive. There are 71 recovery groups, including the Ohio State University Collegiate Recovery Community, which sent a letter to the House Judiciary Committee and the Education and Workforce Committee today expressing concern that two sections of CARA which expand recovery supports for students in high school and in college were dropped out. These are amazing programs. I am so impressed with these brave young men and women who stand up and say: I have a problem. I have an addition. For other students at this high school or at this college, who, like me, have this addiction, have this disease, I want to help you. We should work together and come together in support groups. There did not use to be any of these hardly, as far as I know. Now there are a number of them. Ohio State University is one of the places that took the lead in this. I am so proud of those students who stood up and said: Despite the stigma around this, I am going to stand up and say that I have this problem, and I know many of you do too. If you do, come, and we can work together to work through this problem. Again, what they say is, ``We support a comprehensive approach to addressing this epidemic, which must include providing recovery supports that enable individuals to enter and sustain their recovery.'' Again, CARA is comprehensive. No other bill comes close. As this process moves forward, I hope we will insist that any final agreement represents a comprehensive approach because this epidemic has to be combated from all angles. The approach we took to writing CARA was to say we are going to take the best ideas regardless of where they come from. We don't care who brings them. We just care what the idea means to help address this problem. We had ideas from Democrats. We had ideas from Republicans. We had ideas from House Members, from Senators, from experts in law enforcement, and from patients in recovery. We didn't ask who had the idea, we asked if it was a good idea. That is how you cobble together good legislation that makes a difference in our communities. On Friday I was in Ohio chairing a hearing of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. It was at University Hospitals of Cleveland, OH. We heard from law enforcement experts such as the attorney general, Mike DeWine, and the acting U.S. attorney, Carole Rendon. She was great, as was Senator DeWine. Law enforcement, including the Fraternal Order of Police, has been strongly supportive of CARA because they believe this comprehensive approach works. We also provide training for the administering of this naloxone we talked about, the Narcan, and being sure that law enforcement has what they need to be able to help combat this issue. We also create these law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and methamphetamines. They want better tools, law enforcement does, so they can save lives. We owe them that. In Ohio I am that our first responders have used naloxone more than 16,000 times in the last year alone. Thank God for those first responders because they have saved thousands and thousands of lives. On Friday we also heard from Tracy Plouck from the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. We heard from Dr. Nancy Young of Children and Family Futures and Dr. Margaret Kotz, who is the director of Addiction Recovery Services at University Hospitals in Cleveland, one of the experts we have relied on. They talked about the recovery process. Their point was that probably 9 out of 10 people who need treatment are not getting it. That is a clear sign the status quo is not working. Some of it is the stigma we talked about earlier, people are not coming forward. Some of it is not having treatment programs that are accessible. We heard about waiting lists, sometimes 3 or 4 days, sometimes 14 days, sometimes a couple of months--and people being at that point in their lives where they are willing to come forward and say: I need to solve this problem. Yet there is a waiting list. Last night I had a tele-townhall meeting. We had 25,000 Ohioans on at any one time. It was a big group. People were talking about all kinds of issues, from the terrorist threat we face to energy and environment issues, to the jobs issue. One guy called in and he asked: What are you doing about treatment for people who have drug problems? So I told him about the CARA legislation and he seemed to have a quiver in his voice. I asked him: You seem to have a lot of interest in this and some information about it. Can you tell us your background? I thought perhaps he was a doctor or a treatment specialist. Unfortunately, he said what you hear more and more from parents, which is: I lost my child to addiction. She had an overdose. She died. And the reason I am so focused on treatment, Senator Portman, is because we got her to the place in her life where she was willing to go, finally, to a treatment center and get the treatment and recovery services she needed to deal with this disease that had gripped her--and there was no room at the inn. There was a waiting list. We couldn't get her in, and it was during that period that we couldn't get her into the treatment center that would have helped her that she overdosed. This is a caller from last night who--on a call--was willing to say this in front of 25,000 people. I told him I appreciated the fact that he had the courage to call in and the courage to talk about it. Of course, I expressed my sympathy to him and his family but asked him to continue talking about it, to channel that grief into something positive. Until we get more people into treatment, this is going to continue to be a huge problem in every one of our communities. Until we change the law, until we get legislation passed in Washington so we can be better partners, we are not going to be doing our part. Will Washington solve this problem? No. This problem is going to be solved in our communities, it is going to be solved in our families, and it is going to be solved in our hearts. We have to get people to pull away from this, to understand the dangers, better prevention and education. In our legislation, we have a prevention program to build awareness about the connection with prescription drugs and heroin. I bet most people listening [[Page S2446]] right now didn't know about that connection, a lot of people don't. Why would you, if you hadn't faced this issue? That awareness alone is going to make people make better decisions for themselves, for their children. Friday in Cleveland we had a man testify whose son died of an overdose. Do you know why? Because he had his molars--his wisdom teeth--taken out. When he had his wisdom teeth taken out, what happened? You know where I am going. They gave his son, a kid, Percocet--a narcotic, a painkiller. The rest of the story you know, which is he started taking more of those and more of those. Then he took some from the bathroom shelf of one of his relatives. He developed this addiction and eventually turned to heroin and overdosed. Now his father, God bless him, is out there talking to high schoolers, talking to middle schoolers, talking to young people about the dangers. We can address this issue. We know we can. There has been success with other awareness programs. Think of smoking and teen smoking. We have made great progress there. We have to make progress on this one. This is about life and death. We heard testimony on Friday from Dr. Michele Walsh, the director of neonatology at University Hospitals. She talked about how she is increasingly seeing babies who are born with what is called neonatal abstinence syndrome. That is a fancy way of saying these poor babies are born with an addiction. She said the symptoms are the same you would see with an adult. It is the fidgeting. It is the sweats. These are little babies. I have gone to these neonatal units, and I know some of my colleagues have. You see these babies. They are so small they can fit in the palm of your hand, and they are addicted. You have these doctors and nurses with incredible passion, such as Dr. Michele Walsh, who are taking care of them. In my home State of Ohio we have had a 750-percent increase in the last 12 years with babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome--a 750-percent increase. Every single neonatal unit in Ohio is facing this. I have been to Rainbow Babies & Children's in Cleveland, which is at this hospital. I have seen what they do. I have been to St. Rita's special care nursery in Lima, OH. I have been to Children's Hospital in my own hometown. They are doing great work, but wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to deal with this issue because we had better prevention and education to let mothers know what the danger is when they are pregnant and they could have better treatment and recovery to get those women out of this grip of addiction so their babies can be born without these issues. Frankly, the long-term effects we talked about at our hearing, talking to experts and doctors, I don't think people know what the long-term effects are--and of course that is scary. They basically take these babies through withdrawal. We have to provide babies with the medication at a lower level--but that you would provide an adult--to take them through the withdrawal process. CARA, the legislation we are talking about, would help these women. It would help these babies by expanding treatment for expectant and postpartum women as well as awarding grants to evidence-based treatment services and residential treatment programs for pregnant women who are struggling with addiction. It would create a pilot program to provide family-based services to women who are addicted to opiates in a nonresidential outpatient setting. It is what we learn from experts-- how to help address this problem--that is in this legislation. I know there are other ideas out there, and that is great, but stripping out some of CARA's core provisions just didn't make any sense to me. Let's keep it comprehensive. Let's be sure and get this legislation done and then work on additional legislation. The House could simply put CARA on the suspension calendar and have a vote on it. That is the calendar where you have to have a two-thirds vote, but something like this with all the cosponsors and all the interest in this issues now, I think it would pass. That means we are one vote away of getting this help to our communities. That is how close we are to a historic achievement to help begin to turn the tide, to make the Federal Government a better partner with our States, our local communities. Our great nonprofits are out there in the trenches doing the work and our families. There is no reason it couldn't happen today, tomorrow, or the next day before we go into another congressional recess. After 3 years of work, it doesn't make sense to start from scratch and try to rewrite this. Let's work together to come up with additional ideas that are course appropriate. Nobody has a monopoly on good ideas around here. Believe me, I know some of these House Members. They have the right intentions. They are trying to help. I appreciate that, but I also think we all need to appreciate the fact that this is a crisis. We are losing more and more Americans, 5,600 since CARA was passed in the Senate. Roughly every 12 minutes we lose someone else. People's lives are on the line. Communities are being impacted. Families are being torn apart. It is time for us to act and act quickly. I appreciate the time today. I urge the House to move quickly on this legislation so we can begin to help our communities in need. I yield back the remainder of my time. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ``El Faro'' Tragedy Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss, first of all, the successful location of the El Faro voyage data recorder by the NTSB. As you all recall, that was the ship that had sailed from Jacksonville and was lost at sea and everyone perished. Today, the NTSB found the data recorder. The U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy, and other search partners were also involved. That gives me hope that we will soon have more answers about this terrible disaster and how to prevent a similar one from happening again. So I want to thank the men and women of the investigative team who worked together to find this important piece of the El Faro puzzle. Today we are also reminded of those who were lost on the El Faro and the loved ones they left behind. They remain in our thoughts and prayers. Zika Virus Madam President, on a different topic, I wanted to come to the floor today and talk again about the Zika virus. Once again there was an announcement that there had been additional cases identified in Florida. Just to recap where we stand now, Zika has now spread to over 43 countries. There are 500 cases in U.S. territories, most of them on the Island of Puerto Rico. In my home State of Florida, there are now 93 cases--the most of any State--and the peak mosquito season is directly ahead. A lot has happened regarding Zika. We have learned more and more about this disease. For example, we are now learning the virus has a direct link to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a very debilitating, often fatal, illness, and it is striking people affected with it. We are learning through recent science that it is not just the first trimester of pregnancy but also potentially in the second trimester that unborn children can be impacted by this, and the impacts are devastating. We are learning that of the two species of mosquitoes that spread the disease, one of them has developed an immunity, a resistance to the most commonly used pesticide to remove them. So there is real concern as we head into the summer months and mosquitoes begin to appear that soon we will wake up to the news that there has now been a mosquito- borne transmission within the continental United States. Here is the bottom line: We don't know everything about this disease. We already know it is bad, but we don't know how bad it is. Every day we find out more things. We know during these summer months it will be increasingly warm in many parts of the country where the two mosquito species that spread the virus can be found--in 30 out [[Page S2447]] of 50 States. We know those mosquitoes tend to grow even faster during warm seasons and when there is a lot of water on the ground. And we know one of the countries most impacted by it--Brazil--will soon host the Summer Olympic Games, which means there is going to be a tremendous amount of travel to and from Brazil, and, in fact, there already is. We know the disease is not just spread through mosquitoes, but it is also sexually transmitted. The result of all this is that there is a real concern about what direction we are headed. The President has asked for $1.9 billion in funding, and I am generally supportive of that request. I believe we need to deal with these issues on the front end as quickly as possible. We don't want to wake up one morning to the realization that we are now in the middle of summer, this has become an epidemic or a catastrophe, and we didn't do anything on the front end. Everyone here will have to explain what their position was at the time. I also think you can be for Zika funding--you can even be for Zika funding at $1.9 billion--and you can also ask questions about how this money is going to be spent and, if possible, how we are going to pay for it because we are facing a debt situation in this country. I believe we can find $1.9 billion to pay for it. I have suggested some of my own. What we don't want to do is to play political games with this. I think it is important. On the one side, you can't just say: Look, I am against anything they are asking for that comes up unless you prove otherwise. I think it is important that we now admit this is a serious issue that needs to be confronted. But it is also not being an obstructionist to ask: How is the money going to be spent? What programs will be funded? Where is the prioritization going to be? I think it is not too much to ask to have a level of detail about that $1.9 billion. What I am concerned about is some of the reports in the news that there are games being played with this. We have heard the news that the administration has redirected $44 million in emergency preparedness grants promised to State and local governments this summer. Oftentimes in politics this is a very typical maneuver. What you do is, you cut money from an organization somewhere and you blame it on congressional inaction--or in the States, on legislative inaction. And they say the reason you are losing this money is that someone is not doing what we want, so you find the most painful, alarming cuts and use them as a leverage point to get pressure built on Congress. So I want to make sure that this is not part of some game. We shouldn't be playing games with this. I think it is also important to understand why, in addition to the $1.9 billion, they are also saying on top of that we also have to repay the $510 million in Ebola funds since the Ebola situation is now under control. These are all legitimate issues that need to be confronted. But in the end, we have to do something about this. I know the Senate and the Congress were not meant to move at warp speed, to say the least. It is a place in which action takes time, and I understand that. But there are things we don't have time for. This issue has to be dealt with on the front end. Summer is here already. If you have been in South Florida, as I have on weekends, and back in my home State, as I will be again this Friday and into the weekend, it is already hot. That heat, combined with a wet season, means mosquitoes. This is mosquito season. We have a disease that is already creating this catastrophic impact in countries neighboring us to the south. We know it is spread by mosquitoes. Mosquito season is rapidly approaching, and we have to get ahead of this. None of us wants to be in a position in June, July, and August where this thing breaks out and we start seeing cases in the continental United States, as we are already seeing in Puerto Rico and in Brazil, and we have no answer for why we did nothing during these months we were here. I don't know what all the impediments are. I know there are conversations going on at the committee level, but I hope we can bridge this rather quickly. There are so many other issues we can argue about. There are so many other issues we can have debates about in the partisan season. But I don't think a disease of this magnitude, with this level of risk, is one we should be playing games with. My hope is that cooler heads will prevail and that over the next few days we will find it within ourselves to find out how to appropriate the necessary money so we can begin to deal with this, at least on the front end. Maybe there is a chunk of money on the front end so we can begin to address it and then we can come back later and fund the rest of it. I think it is incumbent upon the administration and others to say ``This is what the money is going to be spent on'' so we can judge whether the money and the funds are actually going to things that work. But this needs to happen. This problem can't wait, and it shouldn't be a partisan fight. Combating Zika is an appropriate use of public dollars. It is an appropriate use of public dollars. I am for limited government. I am for a very limited Federal Government. But one of the things the Federal Government is tasked with is keeping our people and country safe, particularly from external threats. Traditionally, what that means is an invading army or some military threat from abroad or whatever. In this case, this is a threat emerging from abroad, but it is coming toward the United States. There is nothing that prevents the United States from becoming like some of these other countries that have been impacted by this--nothing. Our people are not genetically immune to Zika. It is a matter of time. It is not a question of if, it is a question of when there will be a mosquito-borne transmission of the Zika disease here in the United States. And when that happens, if the posture of the Congress has been that we did nothing--nothing has happened on this; we are still debating over $200 million or $50 million--people will not be satisfied with that answer. So my hope is that this is dealt with according to the level of urgency it deserves. As I said, in my home State of Florida we already have 93 cases, with 2 new ones over the weekend. Those numbers are only going to grow. It is just a matter of time before there is a mosquito- borne transmission somewhere in the United States--the continental United States, because, as I said, this has already occurred in Puerto Rico--and I hope we get ahead of it before it is too late. As I speak to the appropriators and those involved in this, my hope is that we can find our way forward on this rather quickly. There are so many other issues to argue about; this should not be one of them. The money needs to be spent the right way, but it needs to be spent and it needs to be appropriated, and we should endeavor to pay for as much of it, if not all of it, as we can. It needs to get quickly to the target. We need to move from this process and on to those programs so we can get ahead of it in May and June, before we get into the summer, before we get into mosquito season, and before we have an outbreak in the United States. If not, we then will have to answer to the people as to why nothing happened when we knew the risk was growing and the threat was emerging. With that, Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, it has been nearly 9 months since the United States had an Ambassador to Mexico. The President's nominee to that post, Roberta Jacobson, is eminently qualified for the post. The Arizona Republic noted in an editorial from March that ``she's qualified, respected and needed to do an important job.'' They are right. For more than 20 years, Ms. Jacobson has been immersed in the regional, political, economic, and security issues related to the Western Hemisphere. In fact, as part of her extensive background, she served for a time as Director of the Office of Mexican Affairs at the State Department. She is obviously [[Page S2448]] fluent in Spanish and has earned the respect of her colleagues. She served for 3 years as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Canada, Mexico, and NAFTA issues within the Bureau of Western Hemisphere--experience that would later serve the United States well given that Mexico is America's third largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totaling more than half a trillion dollars. However, she has been waiting for the Senate to confirm her nomination since the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported it to the Senate in November of last year by a vote of 12 to 7. It should be incomprehensible to anyone around the country to have a post of the top diplomat to one of our most important bilateral relations open for this long, but for Arizonans, it is particularly baffling. Arizona alone enjoyed a trade relationship with Mexico of nearly $17 billion last year. On the export side, Arizona exports about $9 billion in goods and services to Mexico every year, which, according to the Arizona Republic, ``accounts for 41 percent of the state's exports, and four times more than our state exports to our next biggest trading partner, Canada.'' According to the Arizona-Mexico Commission: With an economy that now surpasses $1.3 trillion, Mexico ranks as one of the top 20 economies in the world. Mexico's economy has been increasingly focused on manufacturing, particularly since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994. More than $1 billion in goods are exchanged between the United States and Mexico every day. But the U.S.-Mexico relationship is about more than just our economies; transportation issues, security threats, and natural resource management are just some of the fronts on which we cooperate with Mexico. The Arizona Republic notes that ``the Arizona Department of Transportation recently signed a memorandum of understanding to study ways to improve the trade corridor that spans the border.'' Arizona alone shares six ports of entry with Mexico, and Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport facilitates 122 flights a week to and from Mexico. All of this cooperation requires a close partnership between our two countries. The longer the United States goes without having an Ambassador to Mexico, the greater that partnership will suffer. To my knowledge, the holdup in this process is not based on any concrete concerns with the qualifications of this specific nominee. She enjoys overwhelming support. There is no reason not to move forward with this nomination. If there is opposition, then Members should have the opportunity to express it. As such, I will be asking unanimous consent for a time agreement with a rollcall vote on her confirmation. There is simply no reason we should not have an Ambassador to Mexico when we have a candidate as qualified as Roberta Jacobson. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 365; that there be 30 minutes for debate only on the nomination equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session without any intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Florida. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I agree that the U.S.-Mexico relationship is one of our most important bilateral relationships. We do need an ambassador in Mexico City who has a track record of effectively advancing U.S. interests. I do, however, have serious questions about the policies that Assistant Secretary Jacobson has pursued during her tenure in the Western Hemisphere Bureau. I have had conversations with the administration and others, such as Senator Corker, about the concerns, and I remain hopeful that we can find a way to resolve this issue in the very near future, but until then, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I plan to return frequently for as long as it takes to shed a light on this nomination and to make sure it moves forward, so I expect to be here tomorrow to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. World Intellectual Property Day Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the United States is one of the most dynamic and innovative countries in the world. Our Nation's success in areas such as agriculture, manufacturing, computer technology, and medicine can be traced in large measure to our respect for, and protection of, intellectual property. Every year on this day, April 26, we have the opportunity to recognize the important role of intellectual property rights in the fabric of our society when we celebrate World Intellectual Property Day. Nearly 230 years ago, our Founding Fathers recognized the importance of intellectual property and made provisions for its promotion and protection in the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause 8 empowers Congress ``to promote the Progress of Science and Useful arts, by securing, for limited Times, to Authors and Inventors, the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.'' Since that time--and stemming from these values--intellectual property has played a vital role in our economy, supporting jobs and advancing creative and scientific industries. In our modern, innovation economy, patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other forms of IP are more critical than ever. As the Global Intellectual Property Center recently pointed out in their broad survey of Intellectual Property in America, IP-intensive industries employ over 40 million Americans, accounting for 38 percent of total U.S. gross domestic product. Workers in IP-intensive industries are paid better than the national average, earning an average salary of over $50,000 compared to those in non-IP-intensive sectors where the average is roughly $39,000. In fact, intellectual property is so important to the American economy that the collective worth of all of the intellectual property in the United States is now above $5.8 trillion. In Iowa, we have seen how intellectual property has become an integral part of our economy. Our system of strong intellectual property protection has led to $11.2 billion in annual IP-related exports from the State, a total of 667,557 IP-related jobs, and 19.9 percent higher wages for direct IP workers than non-IP workers. Just as Iowans utilized strong IP laws 75 years ago when they were discovering how to feed the world through cutting-edge science, today's Iowans benefit from our system of IP protection as they start companies and create new tech success stories. The Judiciary Committee plays an important role in protecting intellectual property. The committee exercises jurisdiction over our Nation's intellectual property laws including those governing patents, trademarks, and copyrights. We consider legislation that helps to ensure that intellectual property rights continue to promote jobs and innovation. The committee also exercises important oversight of the Patent and Trademark Office, ICANN, the Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, and various law enforcement entities charged with protecting IP. Some recent examples of important legislation that helps promote intellectual property rights are the PATENT Act of 2015 and the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016. The PATENT Act, which passed the committee by a vote of 16 to 4 last June, takes important steps to stop abusive patent litigation practices. As bad actors are exploiting the high costs of litigation and using deceptive tactics to prey on businesses, it is important that this legislation be considered in the Senate. Just 3 weeks ago, the Senate unanimously passed the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, sponsored by Senators Hatch and Coons. Building upon the bipartisan consensus generated in the Judiciary Committee, the bill passed on the Senate floor by a vote of 87 to 0. It is estimated that the American economy loses 2.1 million jobs and over [[Page S2449]] $300 billion in economic losses every year because of trade secret theft. The Defend Trade Secrets Act brings much-needed uniformity to trade secret litigation. This will allow the creators and owners of trade secrets to more effectively address the growing problem of trade secret theft. The House of Representatives is expected to pass our bill this week and I hope it will be immediately signed by the President. Tomorrow, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on counterfeits and their impact on consumer health and safety. We will hear from a panel of experts, including witnesses from the Patent and Trademark Office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and industry. These businesses include companies that provide home health care products and equipment to our troops. They will discuss how counterfeits can harm consumers and what their impact is on the economy. We will hear how law enforcement is addressing this problem as well as how stakeholders are educating consumers to protect themselves from counterfeits. The focus of this year's World Intellectual Property Day is ``digital creativity.'' As the World Intellectual Property Organization notes, the current era of Internet connectivity is transforming how consumable culture such as films, TV, music, books, art, and other cultural works are created and distributed. This has led to radical changes in the way we access content and in how businesses operate. As challenges emerge as to how we protect intellectual property rights in these new economic models, we must continue to search for effective solutions that promote creativity across different mediums. So on this World Intellectual Property Day, it is important to once again recognize the significance of our Nation's robust system of intellectual property protection and enforcement. This system has helped create the United States' enduring role as a leader in innovation and creativity. As the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will continue to embrace my role as a promoter of intellectual property rights and American jobs. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2434-S2449] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado. Nomination of Merrick Garland Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the vacancy on the Supreme Court and the majority's ongoing refusal to consider the nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland. Forty days have passed since the President of the United States nominated Judge Garland to fill Justice Scalia's seat. This is longer than it took for the Senate to confirm Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981. In fact, 75 percent of all Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed within 31 days, but today-- 40 days after his nomination--many Senators haven't even extended Judge Garland the simple courtesy of a meeting. The majority's refusal to hold a vote is without precedent, and the majority has cited none. Instead, the majority is trying to shift the blame. Incredibly, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee recently came to the floor to blame, of all people, not other Senators, not other politicians, but the Chief Justice of the United States of America for politicizing the Court. Ten days before Justice Scalia's death, the Chief Justice said: ``The process is not functioning very well.'' That turns out to have been something of an understatement. The Chief Justice went on and said that the process ``is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees.'' Again, he was not referring to what is going on now in the Senate. This happened before Justice Scalia passed away. There was no way that the Chief Justice could have known there was going to be a vacancy. He continued: ``[Supreme Court Justices] don't work as Democrats or Republicans . . . and I think it's a very unfortunate impression the public might get from the confirmation process.'' His words struck me--particularly given what has gone on since then-- as a candid expression of his concern for the Court as an institution. This concern apparently upset the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He took to the floor and said: The Chief Justice has it exactly backwards. The confirmation process doesn't make the Justices appear political. He continued: The confirmation process has gotten political precisely because the Court has drifted from the constitutional text, and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences. It is absolutely breathtaking that the Chief Justice would be criticized for ``drifting from the constitutional text'' when, for the past 10 weeks, the majority has drifted from article II, section 2, clause 2, which sets out our constitutional responsibility to advise and consent in very clear terms. Worse, the majority's drift isn't even about policy; it is about politics. It is about rolling the dice on an election instead of following the plain text of the Constitution. This is absolutely unprecedented in the history of the Senate. Throughout our history, the Senate has confirmed 17 nominees in Presidential election years to serve on the Supreme Court. The last of these was Justice Kennedy in 1988. When the President made this nomination, he had more than 340 days left in his term. We are talking almost a quarter of the President's term. That is a lot more time than most of those 17 Justices had before this Senate. In the last 100 years, every nominee to a Supreme Court vacancy who did not withdraw--and a couple did--received a timely hearing and vote. On average, the Senate has begun hearings within 40 days of the President's nomination and voted to confirm 70 days after the President's nomination. There is no excuse for not holding a hearing and a vote. If that is what we are going to pay attention to in this Chamber and if that is what we are going to argue for--originalism, strict constructionism--the plain language of the Constitution is clear. There is a reason why no Senate has ever had the audacity to do what this Senate is doing right now--because of how clear that mission is and because there is no one else to do it. The Constitution says: The Senate shall advise and consent. It doesn't say: The House of Representatives shall have a role. It doesn't say: Let the people decide. It says that this is the Senate's job. We should do our job just as every Senate, until now, has done its job since the founding of the country, including the Senate that was there when George Washington was in office. Three of those 17 appointments were confirmed by a Senate that actually contained people who had been at the constitutional convention, and they were consistent with their understanding of what the Founders had agreed to. They had a vote on the floor of the Senate. I am not saying how people should vote. They should vote their conscience, but we should have a vote. The American people expect us to do our job. I want to be clear that I believe there should be hearings. I think we should go through hearings to establish the qualifications of the nominee. I think that is really important. The point I am making about having this vote does not have to do with whom the President nominated. It has to do with our institutional responsibility. It has to do with the rule of law and the image we want to project to our country and overseas. Finally, I have a word to say about the President's nominee. Merrick Garland is an honored and accomplished judge. Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet with him and learn about his judicial record and philosophy. I have known Chief Judge Garland for more than 20 years. I have actually worked for him at the Justice Department when we both worked for the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. I was fresh out of law school, but even then Judge Garland's humility, work ethic, and commitment to the rule of law inspired me and continue to inspire me. Our meeting last week confirmed what I already know. Judge Garland is an intelligent and pragmatic judge who is extraordinarily well- qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. I have wondered whether that is the reason the majority is not holding hearings. They could simply hold the hearings and vote against Judge Garland, which is their prerogative. Why not hold hearings? Maybe they know that the American people, given the opportunity to hear directly from Judge Garland, would see that he is precisely the type of judge who should serve on the Court. A vacancy on the Supreme Court is a rare thing. It doesn't come around very often. For those of us in this country, whether we are in the Senate or in a classroom somewhere, those vacancies, hearings, and debates on the floor present an unparalleled opportunity--a remarkable opportunity--for the American people to engage in a debate about the Court, the Constitution, and all kinds of issues that the Court will consider. That is what these hearings are about. That is what could be going on this summer during this Presidential election year, and we would have a discussion about where we want to head as a country. We are not having it. We are not having it because of this unprecedented action. Because of what the majority has done here, by not meeting with the nominee or holding a hearing, they are denying him the opportunity to make his case to the American people. In the meantime--and this is really critical--the Court will continue to be impaired. Impaired is the word that Justice Scalia himself used when he was asked to recuse himself from a case involving Dick Cheney, then the Vice President of the United States. In that case, he was asked if there would be a presumption of recusal. Justice Scalia's answer [[Page S2435]] to that was this: Maybe if I were on the court of appeals--because if I were on the court of appeals, there would be somebody to replace me, but that is not how it works on the Supreme Court. When there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, leaving the Court with only eight Justices, there is nobody who can fill in. There is nobody to become the ninth Justice. He said that the Court would therefore be impaired. The action that is being taken right now threatens to impair the Supreme Court not for one session but for two sessions of the Court before there is another election. In fact, for the third time since Justice Scalia's death, the Supreme Court could not resolve a dispute because of a 4-to-4 split. The longer this vacancy remains, the more uncertainty and confusion the American people will suffer. As I said, two terms of the Court will be jeopardized by petty politics. Believe me, I know it has become fashionable for Washington to tear down rather than work to improve the democratic institutions that generations of Americans have built, but to so cavalierly impair the judicial branch of our government is pathetic. It is time for the Senate to do its job as every Senate has done before us. Again, I am not asking my colleagues to support Judge Garland's nomination. That is a matter of conscience for each of us. But we must fulfill our basic constitutional obligation of holding a hearing and a vote. This is literally--because it is in the Constitution and no one else is granted this power--the least we can do to demonstrate that we are a legislative body that functions as the Constitution requires. We certainly have plenty of time. In view of that, if by contrast we leave for our scheduled 7 weeks of summer vacation--which is not enshrined in the Constitution but is a schedule that is set by the Senate--without having fulfilled our responsibility, the American people should demand that we return to Washington and do our job. It is past time for my colleagues to meet with Judge Garland, hold hearings on his record, and give the American people an up-or-down vote on this judicial vacancy. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority whip. The Appropriations Process Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I fear that sometimes here in the Senate we get bogged down in the minutia and the process and don't really talk about the why of how things are done here. We talk a lot about the how, but we don't talk about the why. I just want to speak for a couple of minutes about why it is so important that we pass the regular appropriation bills and put what we are trying to do here in a larger context. Our colleagues will remember that last year we were unable to pass the 12 regular appropriation bills because our Democratic colleagues filibustered those pieces of legislation in order to force a negotiation to raise the spending caps on discretionary spending. I regret that. I wish it hadn't happened, but it did and there is not much we can do about it. But in the process, what happened is that we ended up having to pass a fiscal year-end omnibus appropriations bill that lacked any basic transparency. There was about $1 trillion-plus worth of spending, and I think most people's reaction is this: Why do you have to do business in such a terrible way that lacks transparency, doesn't let people know what is in the bill, and doesn't let all 100 Senators contribute to the product? The reason is because our Democratic colleagues blocked those bills. I hope it is different this year because now those top-line numbers for discretionary spending are fixed in law. What we are trying to do, starting with the Energy and Water appropriations bill that Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein are working through the legislative process, is to begin the process of passing those regular appropriation bills. I hope and trust we will conclude with this piece of legislation this week and then we will move on to the next legislative vehicle, which will probably be the transportation, housing, and urban development legislation, the so-called THUD bill around here. We have actually demonstrated that by providing an open process, we can actually get some things done. We all recall last Congress--a year and a half ago. The fact of the matter is that a decision had been made by the then-majority leader, Senator Reid, not to allow Senators to participate in the amendment process on the floor. As a consequence, it wasn't just those of us in the minority who were prohibited from offering legislation that would actually improve the product that was on the floor, it included Members of his own political party. So they had to go home at election time and explain to their constituents back home: I may be in the majority, but I couldn't get an amendment voted on, on the Senate floor. Having learned from that experience, Senator McConnell and we decided that the best thing to do is to have an open process by which Members of the majority party and minority party, Democrats and Republicans alike--anybody who has a good idea--can come forward and get a vote on that legislation. We had a couple of recent bipartisan successes. Yes, I know in some corners ``bipartisanship'' is a dirty word, but the fact is, you can't get anything done around here unless it is bipartisan. Our Constitution was written in a way to force consensus to be built. In an absence of consensus, nothing gets done. So we have had a couple of recent successes, in addition to our work on appropriations bills, including the Energy Policy Modernization Act. One of the most important parts of that legislation from my perspective is that back in Texas we saw an expedited process for the approval of liquefied natural gas export terminals. That is very important to our economy and something that takes advantage of an incredible resource we have in America--natural gas--which we would like to sell to our allies and friends around the world when they don't have it. That is something that builds jobs in America. It helps grow our economy. It helps provide a lifeline to many of our allies around the world, for whom energy is being used simply as a weapon by people like Vladimir Putin. We also voted to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration bill. Obviously, this is important for public safety--to make sure our skies are safe--but also to provide the appropriate regulatory regime for the airline industry. Looked at individually, these bills may not seem like an end-all or be-all, but they are part of a bigger picture and part of a larger goal, which is getting this legislative body back to work again, as it was meant to do, considering and passing legislation that will impact our country for the better. Don't get me wrong. Sometimes the right answer is to stop bad ideas. Sometimes the right idea is to stop bad ideas, but where there is an opportunity for consensus and where we can actually craft something that helps move our country forward--I believe all 100 Senators came here with that sort of goal in mind. The bottom line is, we are working again to advance the priorities of the American people. In the same way we debate and discuss the Energy and Water appropriations bill, we have to keep the bigger picture in mind. It is not just about passing a single appropriations bill or to check items off our to-do list, it is part of a larger process, which is to fund the Federal Government in a fiscally responsible way, hopefully--that is our goal--and to make sure we review the programs that are funded by Federal appropriations and make sure they are still the priorities we believe they should be. If they aren't, then they shouldn't be funded. That is part of the process--to go back and look at what the programs are, whether they are still working, whether they are still necessary, and if they are not working or no longer necessary, then we simply no longer fund those as part of the appropriations process. We know this sets our country's priorities by giving guidance on everything we support--from our veterans to how we provide for our energy structure needs, to how we equip and train our troops. Funding the government is actually one of the most important and basic duties of the Congress. As the Senator from Tennessee has pointed out, one of the biggest problems we have--one we are not going to solve here today or this week, unfortunately--is that so much of the money [[Page S2436]] that gets spent by the Federal Government is on autopilot--so-called mandatory spending. In other words, it is not even subject to the appropriations process in the Senate. Currently, only about one-third of the money the Federal Government spends actually goes through this sort of transparent and open process, where everybody knows what is going on and can offer their input. The rest of the money is spent on autopilot, and it is projected to rise, according to one recent projection I saw, at a rate of roughly 5.3 percent over the next 30 years. We know that is far beyond the rate of inflation, and it is an unsustainable amount of spending. Some of the most important programs that are government funded, such as Medicare or Social Security, cannot be sustained at the current level of spending unless we do everything we can within our ability to shore them up and save them for the next generation. That is what we actually need to be doing in the larger picture. Until that day, we can continue to do what we can to deal responsibly with discretionary spending, and that is what we are trying to do. If we don't deal with these appropriations bills in a methodical and deliberate sort of way--all 12 of them--we are going to find ourselves at the end of September, at the end of the fiscal year, back in the same situation we were in last year--with the need for an omnibus appropriations bill or a continuing resolution, which is something I know there is not a lot of appetite for. Zika Virus Mr. President, let me just say a word about the Zika virus and the emergency funding request made by the President. Some of our colleagues--notably the Democratic leader and the Democratic whip-- talked about this this morning and raised the question of whether we are going to responsibly deal with this threat of the Zika virus. I can tell my colleagues we will. We are committed on a bipartisan basis to try to make sure we respond responsibly both from a public safety point of view and from a fiscal point of view. The President requested $1.9 billion. Thankfully, there is money that has been identified that was left over from the Ebola threat--some $500 million--that can be used as a downpayment to make sure our world-class scientists, like the ones I have met at the University of Texas medical branch in Galveston and just this last week at the Texas Medical Center, are doing the research that is necessary in order to identify how to stop this threat by controlling the mosquitoes that bring it into the country. We know the mosquito that carries the Zika virus is common in more temperate and warmer parts of the country, and that is why it has been primarily a threat in Brazil and places like Haiti and Puerto Rico. We also know that in places like Texas, Florida, and Louisiana, this mosquito is present and there are already established cases of Zika, primarily occurring in, I believe, either people who have traveled to Central America or South America and who have been bitten and brought it back with them or, in the case of--apparently it has now been discovered that this virus can be sexually transmitted. So one of the things we need to make sure of, particularly for every woman of child-bearing age, is that they get the sort of protection they need so these horrific birth defects that we have seen in the news don't occur. We are all committed to doing that. We also ought to make sure we don't overshoot our goal and write a blank check for something when we don't even know what the plan of attack is. In some ways, this is like the President asking us to fund a war without telling us what his strategy is for fighting and winning that war. I think that is the sort of commonsense question our constituents want us to ask, and which we should ask. I realize not everything is knowable. Hopefully, within a couple of years, our scientific community will have developed a vaccine which can protect people from this virus, but in the meantime we need to continue to fund the basic research. We need to continue to fund at the local level the mosquito eradication, and we need to keep our eye on this emerging threat. We can do that, and we will do that in a responsible sort of way. We don't need our colleagues on the Democratic side to say we have to do it right here, right now, without even having a plan from the administration on how we will fight and win this war against the Zika virus and hold up the regular appropriations process. I can tell from the saber-rattling going on from some of my colleagues across the aisle that they are looking for a reason to disrupt the regular appropriations process and that can be a mistake. First of all, it will not accomplish anything that can't otherwise be accomplished in terms of funding our research and the fight against the Zika virus. We are committed to doing that in a bipartisan sort of way but in a responsible sort of way that doesn't add to the national debt and pass the bill on to the next generation, as well as a proportional response to the threat. Just throwing money at it without a plan does not seem like a responsible thing to do. I implore our colleagues across the aisle, do not try to use the Zika crisis to hold hostage our ability to do our regular appropriations work. It is too important to avoid the year-end Omnibus appropriations bill that nobody says they like, and it is important for us to demonstrate--as we have tried to and I believe succeeded in doing, in large part--that we can continue to do our work day in and day out on a bipartisan, responsible basis, not that we are all going to agree on everything--that is just not the way people are built--nor do they want us to agree on everything. This is the place where we have the great debates on the issues that confront our country, both now and in the future, and that is appropriate. Nobody should take it personally. We need to have those debates. We need to have those verbal confrontations so we can get to the truth and figure the best path forward for the country. So we are not here to kick the can down the road. We are here to do the Nation's business, and we are here to deliver results to the American people. I hope we can continue to do that by carefully discussing, debating, and then voting on all 12 appropriations bills. In addition to talking about how, I hope to explain a little bit of the why it is so important that we do this now in order to avoid that year-end rush to an omnibus appropriations bill later on. Mr. President, I don't see any other Senators seeking recognition, so I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first, to the majority whip, I thank him for his comments on the Zika virus. He is absolutely right to raise awareness of that issue. It is a great concern. In Ohio we happen to have some military assets that have been used in the past for aerial spraying, and I know they are interested in being even more involved in some of the eradication of some of these mosquitoes in the southern part of the country that may end up causing some of this infection. It is a very serious matter, and I am glad to know the Appropriations Committee is working on it as well as our authorizing committees. I know the Senator from Texas has a personal interest in this. I rise to speak about the underlying legislation--the Energy and Water appropriations bill. I thank the chairman of that committee, Senator Alexander, for working with me to include a couple of important provisions for the State of Ohio. One is the cleanup of what is known as the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant. This is a site that for half a century enriched uranium. This uranium was used by our Navy, for our military, and for other purposes, including our nuclear arsenals, but it also has been used for our powerplants. So for decades the people in Piketon, OH, have been helping keep Americans safe and also helping thousands of Ohioans to keep the lights on and to stay warm at a reasonable cost. Now we have to clean up this facility. We moved on to other technology. It is an efficient [[Page S2437]] technology, but it is a heck of a cleanup removing all this gaseous diffusion material and properly disposing of it. This cleanup effort employs about 2,000 Ohioans. They are doing their job and doing it very well. We have to support them. Unfortunately, over the years they have not gotten the support they deserve. In a 2008 campaign trip to Ohio, the President gave a commitment that he would accelerate that cleanup. Frankly, that just hasn't happened under the President's budget, so every year we have to fight for more funding to be sure that we can continue the cleanup, which is so important, but also to ensure that we aren't losing jobs in Pike County. We just had this tragic occurrence where we had four different homes where family members were present during the horrible shooting out there in Pike County. This is one of the counties in Ohio that have relatively high unemployment. It is a county that has a lot of economic issues. These 2,000 jobs are good-paying jobs with good benefits, so it is very important that we keep the jobs there. Just as importantly, it is the right thing to do for the taxpayers because as the Obama administration has pulled back funding for this cleanup, it ends up costing the taxpayers more because delaying this cleanup ends up adding huge additional costs as funding is cut back and there is less cleanup going on. Our analysis shows that an accelerated cleanup could save the taxpayers $4 billion, getting this done and moving the site on to commercial use. Having adequate funding will save the taxpayers money. Second, cleaning up the radioactive waste and other hazardous waste there is incredibly important for the community. It makes that site cleaner, of course, and is better for the environment. It is important for the community and these people who have for many years been providing us with the enriched uranium for our military and for our powerplants to know they are not going to be left with this environmental problem. Third, these are good-paying jobs in a county that really needs them. Finally, we owe it to the community to clean up the site so they can redevelop it. They want to reindustrialize this site, and it is a great location to do maybe an energy project or maybe a nuclear powerplant at some point and other exciting opportunities, but they have to clean up what is there in order for the site to be used for that. The people of Piketon have helped shore up our economy and our national defense. We owe it to them to clean up this site. I am pleased that in this legislation we are considering an increase of $20 million over this year's level of cleanup work and an additional $20 million over this year's level for constructing a needed onsite disposal cell. We are at the point where we need to dispose of this material, and we need more money for that disposal cell. I am hoping that the House will increase the funding for the disposal cell even more, and if so, we will work in conference to get that number up further because that makes a lot of sense in order to actually move forward on this cleanup for all the reasons I have stated. Again, I thank the chairman, Senator Alexander, for his help on this. One thing the chairman knows well is that part of the funding for the cleanup work comes from the Department of Energy's barter of uranium. I ask that as we move forward with the completion of this legislation over the next few months, if the price of uranium should change--should drop--that the chairman continue to work with us to ensure that there are no job losses and to ensure that the cleanup work is not delayed as it has been in the past. Second, I thank the chairman for including another provision that is incredibly important to Ohio and to Lake Erie. For many years the Army Corps of Engineers has been dredging the Cuyahoga River. It is necessary to do that for commercial purposes. They have a big steel plant there, which anybody who comes to the Republican Convention will see. It is very important, for that plant and other commercial purposes, to keep this waterway open for boat traffic, including bringing iron ore in for the steel mills. Unfortunately, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wants to take the dredge from the river and dump it into Lake Erie. Time and time again, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and others have said this is not good for the environment. Specifically, the dredge has PCB material. The PCB pollutants get into the fish, and the Ohio EPA has told them that if they keep dumping it into the lake, at some point they will have to issue a warning that the walleye in Lake Erie, which is our great game fish, is not to be eaten more than a certain number of times per month. This would kill the fishing industry. It is also the wrong thing to do with all the algal bloom problems we have in the lake because that is driven by nitrogen and phosphorous mostly, and those nutrients would get into the lake through this dumping. So we are saying: Let's use an onsite disposal facility. We have one on land that they can use. They are refusing to do that. The Army Corps of Engineers has gone so far as to, in the last appropriations bill, actually cut their own funding--which is something I have never seen before--to not be able to meet the requirement we put into law, saying that they have to provide for the disposal of this product not into the lake but onto a land facility. We have now worked with Chairman Alexander to include language in this legislation before us. Senator Sherrod Brown and I were successful in getting that in last year. Once again we are working with the chairman to get that language in this year. I thank Senator Alexander for including it. It maintains the requirement that ensures that the Corps uphold its funding obligations to dispose of this dredge material upland and not in the lake. Again, it concerns me that the Corps seems to want to try to get around this. In fact, instead of putting money into the operations and maintenance account, as they are required to do to comply with not just what Congress says but, frankly, what the court has ordered them to do--because the court has consistently said they have to dredge and then dump on land, they have actually put that into a risky position by saying they don't need the funding. They have gone so far as to indicate that maybe other dredging projects on Lake Erie or other Lake Erie funding could be in jeopardy of not receiving the full amount of money they need if there is a need to dispose of this on land. There is a better way. The Corps should request use of unallocated funds provided by Congress in order to dispose of the dredge material at Cleveland Harbor safely without putting other projects at risk. They can do that. Our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, is currently investigating whether the Corps intentionally requested a decrease in funding in last year's spending bill so that they would have no choice but to dump this dredge material into the harbor. I hope that is not true. I hope we find out that is not what happened, but there are indications of that. Again, doing so would threaten the health of the area, the city of Cleveland, Lake Erie's ecosystem, and specifically our fishing industry in Lake Erie, which is so critical to economic growth in that area. Lake Erie is the most productive of all of our Great Lakes in terms of fishing. It has a $6 billion fishing industry and is the No. 1 tourist attraction in Ohio. I urge the Corps to revise its work plan for this year to request the additional funds necessary to safely dispose of the dredge sediment at the Cleveland Harbor during the 2016 dredging season if, as I suspect, the Federal judge again rules that the Corps cannot place it in Lake Erie. I urge them to work with us to come up with a solution so we can have this dredge material disposed of on land and actually recycle that material so that it has value. A couple of weeks ago when I was at the site, I saw how some of the material is being mixed with other fill and being used not just for landfill but also for gardens and for farming and agriculture purposes. This is a way to take the dredge and to actually have it have value and be able to recycle it. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to give this statement today and for his patience. I also thank Chairman Alexander and others who have worked with us on this so that we can indeed be sure that we clean up this site and that we are able to get this dredge material coming out [[Page S2438]] of the Cuyahoga River onto a site on land to avoid the environmental damage that would otherwise occur. I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Mr. SCHATZ. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 17 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman). Without objection, it is so ordered. Zika Virus Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I first want to talk about the Zika public health emergency that is coming to the United States of America. We have to act now to fund the administration's request of $1.9 billion in supplemental funding. Zika is a disease carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector that has already caused a dengue epidemic in my State of Hawaii. The Aedes mosquitoes are in more places than we previously thought throughout the United States. Zika is the first mosquito-borne illness to be associated with a congenital birth defect. We are continuing to learn more about this devastating disease every day, including its association with Guillain- Barre syndrome--a type of paralysis--eye abnormalities, and more. While there have not yet been any locally transmitted diseases of Zika in the continental United States, we do have hundreds of travel- related cases and up to 500 cases of active transmission in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As I mentioned, Hawaii is recovering from a dengue epidemic. So we must provide emergency funding for mosquito-borne illnesses, and we must do it now. This is an emergency. The administration has clearly laid out its request to combat Zika, which includes the following: $830 million for the CDC. This money would include grants and technical assistance to Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories and help our domestic and international response activities; about $250 million for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to increase the Federal match rate to Puerto Rico; and several hundred million dollars for the National Institutes of Health and BARDA to invest in vaccine research and development. That is the long-term solution. There is a high degree of competence that we will be able to get a vaccine but not without the funding. This is an absolute emergency. We need $10 million for the FDA vaccine and diagnostics development and review, which is absolutely critical--we don't have diagnostic tests that are quite as efficient and effective as we are eventually going to need--and $335 million for USAID efforts abroad in public health infrastructure. I was fortunate to visit the CDC in Atlanta a couple of weeks ago to learn more about their efforts to combat Zika, dengue, and other vector-borne diseases. I saw firsthand how the CDC has activated its Level 1 Emergency Operations Center to combat Zika. During my questions at the Labor-HHS appropriations hearings, I heard how the CDC is strapped for funds and has already programmed its Ebola funds and how these Ebola funds are critically needed to prevent another Ebola crisis. I have total confidence in the CDC, but they need this emergency funding request to be granted. We are about to go on a 1-week recess. There is no reason that we can't at least get on the supplemental this week. This is an absolute emergency. There are a lot of things we are doing that are important this week in terms of individual appropriations bills, but let's be clear: None of these appropriations bills are going to pass in the next week or even the next month. We still have the House that needs to take action, and there is no doubt we are going to go to conference. So in terms of whatever other legislative vehicles are pending or about to be pending, there is no urgency for us to move to those instead of what is happening right now in terms of a public health emergency with Zika. This is an absolute emergency. The reason this is not smashing through every headline online, on television, in the newspapers, and on the radio is that it is still cold outside in a lot of places and the mosquitoes haven't come out. This is about to be a very serious public health crisis. For those of us who have differing views about the size and scope of government, I just want to say this: We have arguments about the EPA's role, about the Department of Human Services' role, about the Department of Education's role, and the size and scope of government across the board, but can't we agree that government's basic job is to protect its citizens, and can't we agree that the CDC is one of the best agencies in the government across the board, and can't we agree that this is a real emergency and ought not to wait until May or June or July and ought to be taken up immediately? Mr. President, this is an emergency, and we ought to fund the supplemental on a big bipartisan vote. Trans-Pacific Partnership Mr. President, I would like to talk about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Many promises were made about the TPP. Before the final text was available, I received dozens of phone calls from advocates of the deal asking for my support. They said that this trade agreement was going to be different; that it would raise standards rather than lower them; and that my concerns about labor, the environment, climate change, public health, and consumer protection would be addressed. But since the text was released, I have read it, and unfortunately this deal does not turn out to be any different from the previous deals. It looks like just another race to the bottom. Proponents claimed that the labor and environment chapters would contain enforceable commitments, and I know a lot of people worked very hard to make that true. But when you look closely at the wording of these chapters, you see that the commitments are basically just strongly worded suggestions. There are very few requirements. Instead, the countries have promised to ``promote,'' ``encourage,'' ``cooperate,'' ``strive,'' and ``endeavor'' to do various things. I have no clue how one can enforce an obligation to encourage something or discourage something. Many of the provisions contain this weak language, carefully written by lawyers to be unenforceable. Here are a few examples from the environment chapter, which is particularly weak. First, the chapter opens with a general commitment that ``each Party shall strive to ensure that its environmental laws . . . provide for, and encourage, high levels of environmental protection.'' That is right; they are to ``strive to ensure.'' On transitioning to a low-emissions economy, ``Parties shall cooperate to address matters of joint or common interest.'' There is nothing more on climate change whatsoever. On marine animal conservation, ``Each party shall promote the long- term conservation'' of sharks and various marine animals through ``such measures'' considered appropriate. I don't even know what that means. What is clear is that none of this is enforceable. So the problem is, no accountability. There is no requirement that countries meet their obligations before Congress has to vote on the agreement and no independent verification of whether those obligations are ever met. We will vote to open our markets on day one to goods made under terrible labor and environmental conditions and hope that over time, after we have forfeited our leverage, these countries will implement and enforce the kinds of labor laws our country has had for decades. What this means is that we are giving them the deal, and after we forfeit all of our leverage, we hope they will see the light and do the right thing. Take Vietnam as an example. The economic benefits to Vietnam of reduced or eliminated U.S. duties are enormous. Importers from Vietnam currently pay around $2 billion in annual tariffs. Most of that comes from imports of apparel and footwear--industries that frequently utilize forced and child labor. Although Vietnam is supposed to comply on day one with the labor side agreement it signed with the United States, there is no independent verification. The side agreement sets up a long process of consultation before punitive action can be taken. At that point, Vietnam will already be enjoying the benefit of the elimination of the tariff, and the United States will have lost jobs that cannot compete [[Page S2439]] with forced child labor. No punitive action will bring back those jobs. Now let's talk about the enforcement side. Our track record, unfortunately, is not good. In the limited instances in which there are enforcement mechanisms in our trade agreements, we rarely utilize them. Recently, the GAO reported a systemic failure to enforce labor and environmental commitments across several trade agreements, even in light of compelling evidence of violations. The reason for this is that we don't really provide the resources for enforcement. But more importantly, there is a real lack of political will. For instance, the inclusion of Malaysia in this trade zone gives us insight into the lack of political will. When we debated fast-track authority last year, Congress agreed on an important negotiating objective: No trade deals with countries that earn the worst human trafficking ranking, according to the U.S. State Department. This seems like something everyone ought to agree to. At the time, this included Malaysia, which had the lowest ranking. But just after fast-track became law, Malaysia's ranking was upgraded--to the surprise of human rights experts everywhere. The upgrade allowed the circumvention of Congress's will and the continued inclusion of Malaysia in TPP. This came just a few months after the discovery of human cages and 130 graves at a human trafficking detention camp on the Malaysia-Thailand border. Against this backdrop, it is hard to have confidence that we will ever prioritize labor rights, human rights, or environmental protection over commercial interests. I am also deeply concerned about the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions, or ISDS for short. ISDS provides a special forum outside of our court system that is just available to foreign investors. These investors are given the right to sue governments over laws and regulations that impact their businesses--a legal right that is not granted to a labor union, an individual, or anyone else. Here is how it works: If a decision is made by a national government that is contradicted by a provision in a trade agreement, the trade agreement wins. If a law that we pass contradicts a provision in TPP, TPP trumps our law. Corporations are increasingly seeing this as a viable legal strategy to increase profits and undermine public health and environmental and labor protections. The ISDS forum is not available to anyone other than foreign corporations. It is not open to domestic businesses, labor unions, civil societies, or individuals who allege a violation of a trade agreement obligation. The arbitrators in ISDS who preside over these cases are literally not accountable to anyone. Their decisions cannot be appealed. By profession, the arbitrators usually make their living working as lawyers for multinational corporations. The arbitrators cannot force the government to change its laws, but they can order the government to pay the investor when they lose money as a result of a law that contradicts a trade agreement, which can have the same effect. It is one thing for the United States to decide to pay a penalty to keep a law in place, but small countries cannot afford to go up against these multinational corporations in the ISDS context. Not only will they repeal their national laws, they sometimes will not enact national laws knowing that they will be subject to fines under this ISDS process. The government often agrees to change the law or regulation that is being challenged, in addition to paying compensation. The threat of a case can be enough to convince a government to back away from legitimate public health, safety, or environmental policies. The practical implication is potentially sweeping. ISDS could prevent us from addressing climate change, raising the minimum wage, protecting consumers from harmful products, or preventing another financial crisis. Each time we pass a law or regulation to improve the lives of the American people, foreign investors will effectively have the final say. These risks are not theoretical. In fact, for the United States, the risk of ISDS has become very real. In January, TransCanada--the Canadian company behind the Keystone XL Pipeline--filed a claim against the U.S. Government under NAFTA's ISDS provisions for failing to approve the pipeline. If TransCanada wins, taxpayers--U.S. taxpayers-- would be on the hook for $15 billion in damages being demanded by foreign corporations. Make no mistake. This is a new strategy for fossil fuel companies to challenge laws and regulations that are attempting to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. There are hundreds of billions of dollars at stake, and with that on the line, you have to believe that law firms are spending hours systematically scouring every trade and investment agreement for provisions they can use to invalidate Federal law. This is the legal strategy to bust up laws designed to protect public health, the environment, and consumers. Corporate interests should not be the driving force for public policy decisions. Yet that is exactly what this trade agreement would allow. A lot of us had hopes that this trade agreement would be different, but in a lot of ways, it is the same as the bad agreements that have come before it, and in some ways, it is actually worse. We are forfeiting valuable leverage across a huge area of the Asia Pacific that we could have used to lift labor and environmental conditions and level the playing field for our workers. This is not a question of whether you are for trade or whether you believe we should be engaged in the Pacific region, it is a question of how. This deal is, unfortunately, a lowest common denominator agreement. For these reasons, I must oppose the TPP. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Wyoming. The Republican-Led Senate Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I head home to Wyoming just about every weekend. Lots of people from Wyoming come here to Washington to visit as well. When I am home, I get a chance to talk to people, and here in Washington, I get to talk to people. So yesterday is a day I flew here. I had talked to folks in Wyoming early in the morning and then yesterday afternoon got off the plane, and there were a number of students here from Sheridan High School from ``We the People.'' One of our pages here is also from that high school. So you get to hear a lot from people. Some folks have been asking: What has the Republican Congress actually accomplished? So I would like to take a few minutes to talk a little bit about what the Senate has actually done this year and during this Congress since the Republicans have taken over the majority. We are not even 4 months into this year, and we have already had a very productive year in the Senate. It is true. We have been active, we have been effective, and it is only April. In February, we passed legislation to add tough new sanctions against North Korea. As the Presiding Officer knows, the President in the White House was very reluctant when we started proposing these sanctions-- hesitant about the sanctions that we proposed against North Korea. Let's face it. North Korea has been aggressively testing missiles, testing nuclear weapons, and needs to be stopped. When other countries threaten their neighbors, as North Korea has done in their general geographic area, what happens is the United States must stand up and stop them. President Obama has done far too little. I am very concerned about the aggression and the ambitions of North Korea. That is why the Senate had to act. So Congress has stood up and pushed against this action. We had more action against North Korea; that is exactly what we did. The Senate also acted by passing a Defend Trade Secrets Act to help businesses protect their confidential information. We passed a piece of legislation called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation to help fight the misuse of prescription drugs, in terms of prescription pain killers called opioids. Now, look, it has been a huge problem in our country-- communities all around the country. Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire and Senator Portman of Ohio were two of the main sponsors of this legislation. I know [[Page S2440]] Senator Portman was on the floor recently, talking about different legislation. But he has shown heroic leadership in an area that certainly needed to be addressed. The Senate worked and reauthorized the Older Americans Act. This was another bipartisan piece of legislation. It works to help provide senior citizens with things like meals, transportation--ways to help people live in their own homes longer and ways to help in terms of their quality of life, which is very important for Americans all across the country. We passed legislation to overhaul and reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. This is a significant accomplishment. This legislation promotes U.S. aerospace jobs by cutting through some of the redtape that has been hurting airplane designers. Then, just last week, we passed a comprehensive overhaul of American energy policy, something we had not done in about 8 years. Over the past few years, hard-working Americans have made this country into an energy superpower. Yet we had not passed any kind of major energy legislation for about 8 years because Washington's regulations have simply not kept pace, and they have actually worked against the energy producers, people that are getting back to work, getting this country's economy returned. The legislation we passed is going to rein in some of this needless, wasteful bureaucracy that the Federal Government has imposed on the people creating energy jobs and working to produce more energy because energy is called a master resource for a reason. We have it in great abundance. One of the very important parts was language to expedite the shipment of America's natural gas to buyers around the world. It is good for our economy, and it is good for our allies who will be able to decrease their dependence on Russian gas. Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska did an outstanding job of making sure that this legislation had ideas from both sides of the aisle. That is a big part of why this piece of major energy legislation--first time in 8 years--passed 85 to 12--85 to 12. That is another big accomplishment of the Senate this year that does not get enough attention. It is not just that we are passing important legislation that helps Americans, but we are doing it in a bipartisan way that allows every Senator--every Member of this body--to represent the people back home with their ideas and their suggestions. We have voted on 129 amendments so far this year--129 amendments voted on this year. When the Democrats under Harry Reid were in control, a lot of people around here got used to the idea that people did not actually get to vote on amendments. In 2014, the last year under Democratic control under Harry Reid, the Senate had only 15 up- or-down votes on amendments all year--full calendar year 2014. When Republicans took the majority, we changed that. The Senate has been working this year just as we worked last year. We could have done a lot more if a few Democrats had not blocked progress on some very important pieces of legislation. The people in Wyoming now know that there are some important things they really care about, and they were actually blocked by President Obama. In January, the President vetoed legislation that we had passed to improve health care in this country by repealing major parts of ObamaCare. Remember, the President said to Democrats that they should forcefully defend and be proud of that health care law, but one out of four Americans--25 percent of Americans--say they have been personally harmed by the President's health care law. So we put it on his desk to do a repeal, and he vetoed that. Now, only about one in eight people in this country say they have been helped by the health care law. When you take a look at major legislation that impacts the country, it is no surprise that this health care law continues to be very unpopular, especially when you see that for every one person who says they have been helped, there are almost two people who said they have personally been hurt by the law. The President also vetoed legislation that we passed here to bring some sanity to something called the waters of the United States rule-- again, a rule put out in regulation by the President, a reinterpretation of the law. The law is very clear to me, but the President had his own approach. We put a bill on his desk to overturn what he has tried to do. The courts have actually stopped him in his tracks, but he once again vetoed our efforts. Last year the President actually vetoed five different bills passed by Congress. This kind of obstructionism from President Obama doesn't help our country move forward. It is not helpful when the Democratic leaders do everything they can to convince people that nothing is being done in the Senate, but we hear that day after day from Minority Leader Harry Reid. It is interesting, because when Senator Reid was the majority leader, he had a very firm strategy, and the strategy seemed to be to do as little as possible. Well, he is now the minority leader, and I think he went from the majority to the minority for a reason. It seems to me that he is still hanging on, clinging on to that losing strategy. The plan didn't work then, and I think that one of the reasons that he continues to try to talk down and slow down some of our progress is because, actually, he is envious--envious of anyone who gets things done in the Senate. Republicans in the Senate are not interested in working at Harry Reid's pace and neither are the Democrats--many of the Democrats. Most Senators agree that we have a lot of work to do and that it is good for America when we actually do the work. That is why we have been working our way through the appropriations bills. This year we got the earliest start ever to appropriations bills--and really in the history of the modern budget process. So we continue to work on that. I wish to be clear on one important point. Doing our job in the Senate doesn't mean setting aside the priorities of the American people just to help President Obama build a political legacy. That is why the Senate is going to stand firm and strong to give Americans a voice in who gets to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Now President Obama wants us to set aside everything else and let him appoint his Justice to the Supreme Court. It is not going to happen. We do our job every day, doing the things that will make an immediate difference to the families all across the country, things that Republicans and Democrats agree on and that everybody knows we should be doing. That is what you are seeing with this Republican-run Senate. That is what the people want us to do. That is what they expect us to do, and that is what we will continue to do. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 20 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Climate Change Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today is the 135th time I have come to give voice to the issue that I feel will most significantly define this generation of leadership in the United States and, frankly, around the globe. I know that there are many people in Washington who would prefer to ignore what our carbon emissions are doing to our oceans and to our climate, but we disregard nature's warnings at our peril. The changes to our environment, fueled by our carbon pollution, are far-reaching--from the coastlines to the prairies, from mountain tops to deep oceans, from pole to pole. As a terrestrial species, we naturally pay more attention to what is happening on land, such as increasing average global temperatures and upheavals in extreme weather. We don't so much see what is happening in our oceans. Every year we emit into the Earth's thin atmosphere tens of gigatons of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels--nearly 36 gigatons of carbon dioxide in 2014. Not all of that carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere. Our oceans--the Earth's oceans--absorb approximately one- third of all our carbon pollution. That means they have absorbed roughly 600 gigatons in our industrial era. For the record, a gigaton is a billion tons--not a thousand tons, not a million tons, but a billion tons--and 600 [[Page S2441]] billion tons of carbon dioxide have gone into our oceans. We know what that does. All that carbon dioxide in the oceans changes the ocean's very chemistry, and it makes ocean water more acidic. The chemical reaction, carbon dioxide reacting with water to form carbonic acid, is simple. You can replicate it in a middle school science lab, but its effects in the oceans are profound. According to research published in the journal Nature Geoscience, the rate of change in ocean acidity is already faster than at any time in the past 50 million years on Earth. We are rapidly spiraling into unknown territory. By way of context, the human species has been around on Earth for about 200,000 years. The human species started farming and herding, went from hunting and gathering to the basics of socialized human life less than 20,000 years ago. We are doing something to our planet now that has no precedent for 50 million years. This line shows the increasing CO 2 in the atmosphere in parts per million. This line shows the absorption of the CO 2 by the ocean, and this line shows the pH change in the oceans as a result. I would point out that pH is actually measured on a logarithmic scale. So if you were to adjust this to the standard percentage-type display of information, you would see this falling much more steeply. This is a very conservative way of showing what is happening to our oceans. The logarithmic scale is a multiple, not just a steady line. So as you move down the pH numbers, you are actually creating much more massive effects in the ocean. People have measured this drop in ocean pH from climate change. This is not a theory. You can go out and measure it with equipment that is not very different, again, from what a middle school with an aquarium would use to measure pH in the aquarium. People measure something else in our oceans also. They measure the rise in ocean temperature. For decades, the oceans have absorbed over 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gas emissions. The heat that comes in, that gets trapped in our thin atmosphere when the Sun's warmth gets trapped by these greenhouse gasses, lands in a variety of places. The Antarctic ice sheet gets two- tenths of a percent of the heat. The Greenland ice sheet gets two- tenths of a percent of the heat. Arctic sea ice gets eight-tenths of a percent of the heat. Glaciers and icecaps take up nine-tenths of a percent of the heat. All of our continents together, the land mass of the Earth, take up 2.1 percent of the added heat from climate change. The atmosphere, that thin membrane that allows us to live and breathe on this planet, has taken up 2.3 percent of the heat. All the rest of it, 93 percent, has been taken up by the oceans. They are our refrigerant. They are our cooler. They are the air conditioner for the planet. But when you take up that much, things begin to change, and ocean heat is ramping up. A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that in the last 20 years--actually, less than 20, from 1997 to now, to be exact--the oceans absorbed the same amount of heat energy just in that 20-year period as they had in the previous 130 years. That is a dramatic increase in heat uptake by the oceans. It is our human activity, specifically our unfettered burning of fossil fuels, that has made our oceans both warmer overall and more acidic. One result of this is the calamity now taking place in the world's coral reefs. A healthy coral reef is one of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on Earth. It is an engine for the propagation of life. Coral depends on a symbiotic relationship with tiny, photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae. They live in the surface tissue of the coral. Within a limited range of temperature, pH, salinity, and water clarity, this symbiosis can thrive, and it gives us reefs all over the world--these engines of life in the ocean. Living coral has evolved for millions of years to maintain its symbiosis within that range. We are now measurably--not theoretically but measurably--altering the ocean in ways too fast for coral to adapt. Push corals out of their comfort range for very long, and the corals get stressed and they evict their algae. This process is what is known as coral bleaching. Because corals get most of their food out of that symbiotic relationship with these algae, if the algae can't be reabsorbed quickly, the corals die. Coral bleaching sounds benign, but it is like cardiac arrest for a reef. There is a good chance it dies and, even if it doesn't, it is a long recovery. We are currently in the middle of a massive bleaching of the world's coral reefs--cardiac arrest at a global scale. Dr. Mark Eakin of NOAA's Coral Reef Watch Program says of this coral cataclysm: ``It very well may be the worst period of coral bleaching we have seen.'' And when he says ``we have seen,'' he means that which we have ever seen in the human record. Worldwide, coral has already declined by approximately 40 percent. Closer to home, across the Caribbean and the Florida Keys, two key coral species have declined by an astonishing 98 percent in the last four decades. In my lifetime, I have seen once-radiant underwater ecosystems teeming with life become barren fields of white skeletons reaching into an empty ocean. One of my climate trips took me down to Monroe County, FL, where I met Mayor Sylvia Murphy, the Republican mayor of Monroe County, home to the famous Florida Keys. I asked her how the reefs were off the Keys. ``Beautiful,'' she said, ``unless you were here 15 years ago.'' Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral ecosystem on Earth. It is one of the seven wonders of the natural world. Severe bleaching is now hitting ``between 60 and 100 percent of corals'' on the Great Barrier Reef, according to Dr. Terry Hughes of James Cook University in Queensland, Australia. Professor Hughes tweeted out a map of the current devastation, writing in the text: ``I showed the results of aerial survey of bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef to my students, and then we wept.'' As with many other effects of climate change, it can be difficult to convey the magnitude of events when they aren't taking place in front of our terrestrial human faces. In his 2010 TED talk, one of the great marine scientists we have, leading coral ecologist Dr. Jeremy Jackson, tried to bring this coral bleaching calamity a little closer to home. He put it like this: Imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or North America, and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you, and you see that 80 percent of the trees, as far as you can see, have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked. And you come home, and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves. Remember, this is his example from July. And then you read in the paper a few weeks later, ``Oh, by the way, a quarter of those trees died.'' Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino, an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe, when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died. Jeremy came to speak to our caucus recently. He told us that every ocean ecosystem he studied in his career is gone, as he first found it, changed dramatically from his first visit. Coral reefs are one of the first places that truly irreversible effects of climate change seem to be manifesting themselves--the proverbial canary dying in the coal mine of our carbon-ridden planet. To say the ocean we knew in our childhood is already gone is not doomsaying or pessimism, it is a grimly realistic assessment of where we stand, sadly. In the Senate, there will likely be snickering about this. Some will say: Who gives a damn about coral reefs? If it can't be monetized by a corporation, the hell with it, is too often our motto here. Well, God made these glories. God made them on our planet. In some cases, they have been growing for tens of thousands of years. We are wrecking them in a single generation, and if that doesn't mean something to us, a long look in the mirror might be in order. Even those who can only see this tragedy through their monetizer goggles ought to know that a decline in healthy coral reefs is a huge blow to us all. According to an article last month in The Atlantic, coral reefs are home to 25 percent of the world's fish biodiversity. Reefs are incubators for ocean life, support systems for fisheries we depend on, tourist attractions for divers and snorkelers who fill local communities with their visiting and [[Page S2442]] their spending, and they are coastal protection for coastal infrastructure and homes against storm waves. It is not nice to fool with Mother Nature. As Pope Francis warned, ``God always forgives; mankind sometimes forgives; nature never forgives. You slap her and she will slap you back.'' As he says, we are sinning with our actions against nature, and nature will not forget. We just don't have that right. We are making a mark on the Earth in this generation that will not go away. If mankind lasts 10,000 years, well, 10,000 years from now they will see and know the mark of this generation on our planet, and they will justly inquire: How could we have been such fools? How could we, in this generation, have been such greedy, reckless, self-infatuated fools? In 1954, the United States detonated a hydrogen bomb over the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The explosion vaporized everything on three islands, raised water temperatures to as much as 55,000 degrees, and left a crater over a mile wide and 240 feet deep. More than 60 years have gone by and scientists observe the corals in this part of the Pacific flourishing again. If you give it a chance, life finds a way. Dr. Zoe Richards, one of the scientists involved in the study, said: ``The healthy condition of the coral at Bikini Atoll today is proof of their resilience and ability to bounce back from massive disturbances, that is, if the reef is left undisturbed and there are healthy nearby reefs to source the recovery.'' So that is the caveat. Reefs can recover but not if we continue to stack the deck oceanwide against them by pumping so much heat and carbon pollution into the oceans. Senator Schatz of Hawaii--not coincidently another ocean State-- introduced, along with me, the American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act last year to address climate change with a market-based solution built on principles espoused by leading Republican economists. We went to Republicans--former Cabinet officials, former Members of Congress, economists, think tanks--and we said: How should we do this? If you don't like the President's plan, if you don't like the regulatory way, what is your way? Virtually every single person on the Republican side who has thought this problem through to a solution has come to the same place, a revenue-neutral carbon fee with an appropriate border adjustment. So that is what we wrote. When you are ready, we are here. We did it your way. As a Senator, John F. Kennedy once said: Let us not despair but act. Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past--let us accept our own responsibility for the future. This is particularly true for our oceans. As one Florida mayor put it: ``The ocean is not Republican, and it's not Democratic . . . it's a nonpartisan ocean,'' and that nonpartisan ocean is screaming warnings at us that we ought to heed in nonpartisan fashion. We have a clear scientific understanding of the problem, and we have a moral obligation to act. Time is not on our side. We need to pay attention to the evidence. We need to accept the reality of our predicament as it is communicated to us by the laws and signs of nature--God's signals to us on this Earth. That is what healthy coral looks like under the water. Here it is bleached out and dying. It is our ocean. It is our responsibility. I urge this body to wake up and lead. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Tribute to Dr. Emily Lembeck Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to do something I periodically like to do when a citizen of my State deserves recognition for the contributions they have made to my State and the citizens of my State. Today is such a day. Dr. Emily Lembeck is the superintendent of the Marietta City Public School System. Recently, she was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Education, and her palm print is embedded in the walk around Glover Park Square in Marietta, GA. I am close to Emily in more ways than one. When I chaired the State board of education in 1996, she was an elementary school principal at Dunleith Elementary in Marietta, GA. She had been at West Side, she moved on to Marietta Middle School, and later became superintendent of the Marietta Public Schools--8,900 students, 1,200 employees--a challenge but a wonderful community. Throughout her career, she has gifted more to children in our community than any person I know of. In particular, she has taught those who didn't know how to read to read. She has made reading a passion in our community. She has made children's ability to read and comprehend and understand and move forward in life a reality, in a place where at one time it was no reality at all. In fact, let me tell you, when I was chairman of the State board of education we were working hard to make Reading First a movement in this country. She came forward with this idea about adopting something called Marietta Reads. It was a very simple program but a program where leaders in the community, such as I, would come to elementary schools in Marietta, GA, sit down ``Indian style'' on the floor with first graders and teach them to read, read with them, and help them identify with the joy of reading and the understanding of reading. From that day, I gained a greater appreciation for the challenge every teacher faces as they teach our children in classrooms. Emily Lembeck has been awarded almost every award you can possibly get, from the chamber of commerce to the Kiwanis Club, to the Rotary. She has received the Living the Dream Award from the NAACP during King Week a few years ago, she received the Whitney M. Young Jr. Service Award from the Boy Scouts for her leadership. Time and again, Emily Lembeck has been represented to be the great person she is--a leader in education, a leader of children, somebody our community is proud of. So on this day in Washington, DC, on the floor of the Senate, I want the name of Emily Lembeck to ring from one corner to the other for all she has contributed and all she has done to make our community a better, more wholesome, and more meaningful community, and for what she has done to make the lives of our community's children just a little bit better. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Indian Health Service Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, for years now, patients on Indian reservations in the Great Plains area have been receiving substandard medical care. The most recent example of the Indian Health Service's failure occurred in December of 2015, when I was notified that two federally operated Indian Health Service facilities in my State were at risk of losing their Medicare provider agreements. In other words, these two facilities have been delivering such a poor level of care, the government isn't sure it is willing to continue paying these facilities to care for Medicare patients. In February, at the request of several Senators, myself included, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing to address the state of patient care at the Indian Health Service in the Great Plains area. Thanks to the graciousness of our colleague from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, who chairs the Indian Affairs Committee, I was able to participate in this hearing and question several Indian Health Service officials. I wish I could report that this hearing reassured me that the Indian Health Service is on track to solve the problems facing patients on the reservations, but it just left me more concerned. The hearing underscored the government's massive failure on this issue: its failure to deliver quality care, its failure to ensure patient safety, and its failure to live up to treaty responsibilities. [[Page S2443]] I have read the reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and some of the stories really are beyond comprehension. Incredibly, a report of dirty, unsanitized medical equipment left exposed in an emergency room isn't even the most shocking of those stories. One patient who had suffered a severe head injury was discharged from the hospital mere hours after checking in, only to be called back later the same day when his test results arrived. The patient's condition was so serious that he was immediately flown to another facility for care. One health service facility was in such disarray that a pregnant mother gave birth on a bathroom floor--a bathroom floor--without a single medical professional nearby, which shockingly wasn't the first time this had happened at this facility. I wish I were able to stand here today and report that conditions are getting better. Unfortunately, I cannot. Since February's hearing, we have been made aware of another tragic event that occurred at Pine Ridge Hospital. Reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services indicate that a 23-year-old patient complaining of nausea and cramping in his hands and lower extremities died from cardiac arrest 2 hours after he was discharged from the emergency department. An investigation conducted by CMS verified that this young man failed to receive an adequate medical screening evaluation before his discharge. Even worse, the report indicated that there was no documentation showing nurse and doctor communication. It hasn't helped that Congress's attempts to address these problems have been hampered by less-than-honest reporting from the Indian Health Service. Time and again, we have found that conditions on the ground have not matched up to information reported to Congress. In 2014, I requested a status update from the then-Acting Director of the Indian Health Service. In her response, she stated that ``the Great Plains Area has shown marked improvement in all categories'' and that ``significant improvements in health care delivery and program accountability have also been demonstrated.'' Significant improvements? Sending a man home with bleeding in his brain and having a mother give birth prematurely on a bathroom floor are not signs of significant improvements. On December 4, 2015, officials from the Indian Health Service stated that a majority of the concerns at Rosebud Hospital had been addressed or abated. Yet, mere hours later, I was informed that the Rosebud Hospital emergency department was functioning so poorly that emergency patients would be diverted to other hospitals beginning the next day. It has now been 143 days, and the Indian Health Service leadership has been unable to reopen the Rosebud Hospital's emergency department. For the last 143 days, incoming emergency patients have had to travel between 44 and 55 miles to receive care. That is similar to requiring a resident of Harpers Ferry, WV, to travel to Washington, DC, to receive emergency services. And to date, the Indian Health Service has been unable to tell us when it anticipates emergency department services will resume. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe informs me that since this emergency department has been on diverted status, six individuals have lost their lives in ambulances while being transported to a hospital farther away. Six families are now left to wonder whether their loved ones could have been saved if the Indian Health Service had been doing its job. This is unconscionable. The Indian Health Service has one last chance this Friday to reach an agreement with CMS to set the Rosebud Hospital back on a path to compliance with basic safety and administrative requirements. If the Indian Health Service fails to do so, Rosebud will lose its status as a Medicare provider. Additionally, the Indian Health Service has until Friday to address Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act violations found at Pine Ridge Hospital. The administration has drafted report after report promising to correct these issues, yet time and again it has failed to follow through. During the recent Indian Affairs Committee hearing, the former Principal Deputy Director of the Indian Health Service could not remember that he was in charge of implementing a 2011 report. Where is the accountability? Who is in charge? We have got to do better. Simply shifting staff between positions and offices, as the Indian Health Service has done in response to these problems, is not enough. It is time for action. We must do everything within our power--we will do everything within our power--to hold the Indian Health Service accountable and to make sure this never happens again. I continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate on a path forward to demand accountability from an agency that, by all accounts, is disconnected and unresponsive to the needs of our Native Americans. I will also continue to consult with the nine tribes in South Dakota. Our tribes are in the best position to help figure out the path forward for their own health care, and I believe the Indian Health Service must do a better job of consulting with our tribes when it comes to the care they receive. I am going to do everything I can within my power to get all of our tribal citizens the quality care they deserve. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The remarks of Mr. Burr pertaining to the introduction of S. 2854 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. BURR. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the one in three Ohioans who knows somebody who is struggling with addiction to heroin or prescription drugs. I rise today on behalf of the over 5,000 Americans who have lost their lives to a prescription drug overdose since the Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act back on March 10. I rise today to talk about an epidemic which is affecting my home State of Ohio, which is affecting all our States, whichever it is, and which is affecting our country and must be dealt with. This is the fourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate since we passed CARA, which is the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, and I come to floor to talk about our legislation and to ask the House of Representatives to please pass that legislation, which would then go to the President for his signature and could begin to help in communities all across the country. The legislation I am talking about is legislation that the Senator from New Hampshire, now who is the Chair right now, the Presiding Officer, has been involved with in a very deep way in her own State of New Hampshire and also here on the Senate floor. I appreciate all the hard work she has put into this, and I know she agrees with me that it is time for the House to act. We passed it on March 10. That means it has been 47 days since the Senate acted. About 120 Americans die every day of a drug overdose. It has been 47 days. That means we have lost 5,600 Americans to drug overdoses since the Senate passed this bill. By the way, it is not just about that tragic loss of life, it is about so many people who may not have overdosed but have this addiction and are not taking care of their families, are not able to work and be a productive citizen, are not achieving their God-given potential. It is about those who have overdosed but have been saved by this miracle drug that police and firefighters and other first responders and sometimes family members now are administering called Narcan or naloxone. It means that since the Senate passed this bill, this epidemic is getting worse, not better. That is based on [[Page S2444]] all of the information I get back home. Last week in Lebanon, OH--it is a small town north of Cincinnati, OH, where my family has roots going back to the 1920s--in Lebanon, OH, a 34-year-old woman, who was engaged to be married, overdosed and died in front of her children, one aged 10 and one baby girl who was still learning to walk. By the way, that little girl's father has now been arrested. Within days of her mother's addiction--she has now lost both her mom and her father. Last week, from Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday morning--Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday morning--six people died of overdoses in one small town called Elyria, OH. It is not a big city; there are about 53,000 people in Elyria. We lost six people in 24 hours. That does not include the 14 people who were saved by this miracle drug I talked about, Naloxone, that reverses the effects of an overdose. That is what has been happening. That is happening on our streets, and in the case of my home town of Cincinnati, it is happening in our parking lots. At noontime on Sunday, in my hometown, a man overdosed in the parking lot of the Museum Center in Cincinnati, OH. First responders moved quickly and were able to save his life. But it is happening in broad daylight, unfortunately, more and more frequently. Since 2007 drug overdoses have killed more people in Ohio than car accidents, making it the No. 1 cause of accidental death. I am told that nationally, now, it is the leading cause of accidental death in the country. It is not car accidents, which we would might have assumed, it is overdoses. They have more than tripled in Ohio from 1999 to 2010. We are told that 200,000 Ohioans are addicted to opioids--200,000 people. That is the size of a major city like Akron, OH. That is something which should concern us all. Last week there was a poll that showed that 3 in 10 Ohioans know someone who has abused prescription drugs, and 1 in 8 knows someone who has overdosed. We are talking about more than 1.3 million Ohioans. According to NIDA--the National Institute on Drug Abuse--the United States, even though we make up about 5 percent of the world's population, consumes 75 percent of the prescriptions drugs, including the vast majority of the world's prescription painkillers, the narcotic painkillers. They say four to five of the people who are heroin addicts started on prescription drugs. We have heard more about this this week in the news, about the fact that so many people get addicted to the opioid, which is the prescription drug. Sometimes it is actually prescribed to them; sometimes they obtain it illegally. They turn to heroin as a less expensive alternative and then end up overdosing. The results are tragic. If this is not an epidemic, I don't know what is. It is affecting every area. It knows no ZIP Code. So when you think about drugs and drug abuse and the effects of it, you might think inner city. That is not so. It is everywhere--in the suburbs, in the rural areas. It knows no ZIP Code. I mentioned that this legislation we worked on here for a few years passed the Senate. It was bicameral legislation, meaning it was the House and Senate working together for 3 years. We had five conferences here in Washington. We brought in experts on the issues of prevention and education and treatment and recovery and how to deal with our veterans who are coming back, who have a high rate of addiction, how to deal with women and their babies. In my home State of Ohio, we have had a huge increase in the rate of babies being born addicted, and what do you do about that? We put together this legislation in a comprehensive manner to handle not just one part or one sector but to be something that would deal with the holistic approach so that we could actually get at this issue. In the House, by the way, the identical legislation was introduced, and they now have over 120 cosponsors of that legislation in the House. Yet they have not been able to move on that legislation. Instead, they are moving on other legislation to deal with the issue. That is good. I am sure there are a lot of other things that can and should be done. Some of what they are doing is consistent with CARA. But we know CARA works. We know that if we can pass it, the President would sign it. We know it would help immediately in our communities. So I again call on the House to move quickly. Last week a subcommittee in the House chaired by Joe Pitts marked up one dozen bills that have to do with how we fight this epidemic. Joe Pitts is a man who cares a lot about this issue. He has a passion for it. This week my friend and full committee chairman Fred Upton is going to mark up those 12 bills. The House has a lot of good ideas. That is fine. That is good. I joined Congressman Bill Johnson of Marietta, OH, who has been a passionate advocate on this issue, to introduce something called the Preventing Abuse of Cough Medicine Act, which would restrict the sale of certain cough medicines that are frequently abused. That is good. It is a commonsense Ohio idea. I thank my friend and colleague for doing his part to help our constituents. That should be passed in addition to CARA, along with other legislation. I certainly respect my colleagues over there very much, as I said, but let's just give CARA a vote, and then let's move on this other legislation as well. It takes a while, as all of us are painfully aware, to get something through the process around here. This one went through with a 94-to-1 vote. It is comprehensive. It was introduced in both the House and the Senate. They have over 120 cosponsors. Let's just move that. Then, if there are other things to be dealt with, like the one I talked about, we can work on those as well and find ways to work together to find common ground. I will support that. I cannot speak for all of my colleagues, but I can speak for all of them--with the exception of one who voted the other way--to say that we will help get CARA to the President. In fact, it doesn't need to come back to the Senate if they pass the CARA legislation. More and more Members in the House are focused on this issue. That is good. Tomorrow, the House Judiciary Committee is also marking up legislation in this area. So this is a separate committee--the Energy and Commerce Committee--and now the Judiciary Committee. They are going to mark up five related bills, including what they consider the alternative to CARA. It has some of the CARA provisions but not all of them. Let me tell you what the experts out there are saying. There are over 120 groups who have endorsed our legislation, helped us to get our legislation through. Yesterday, the policy director of the Harm Reduction Coalition sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee saying that its alternative ``omits vital provisions in CARA addressing recovery, collateral consequences, prevention, and education. These omitted provisions represent critical community priorities, which truly relate to the comprehensiveness of CARA's approach. CARA was developed through a thorough process of extensive consultation with dozens of stakeholders . . . and has secured the broad support of national, state, and local addiction and recovery, public health, and criminal justice organizations. . . . The version of CARA passed by the Senate represents substantial consensus among both community stakeholders and bipartisan lawmakers.'' The House Judiciary's alternative to CARA does contain some of CARA's best proposals. I appreciate that. But unfortunately it dropped out a number of really important ones as well. Some of the most important ideas that are missing include provisions expanding drug takeback programs. Again, we talked about this earlier. These prescription drugs are at the heart of this problem. These takeback programs get these prescription drugs off the bathroom shelf, allow us to pull these drugs away from our communities so that people are not using these drugs to get into more drugs, to get into heroin. That is not in there. There is also a heroin law enforcement task force that was dropped out and a drug court for veterans called the veterans court. That is a very important issue for all of us. The veterans' testimony we got made it clear to us that these courts are working. I have toured some of these courts. I have had a chance to sit down at a roundtable discussion in Ohio with one of our [[Page S2445]] great veterans courts to talk to veterans whose lives have been entirely turned around by these veterans courts. After years and years of bouncing around in the prison system or at the VA, finally they get into these drugs courts for veterans, where they are surrounded by other veterans and they are able to pull their lives together, to get their families back together, and in one case go back to school. There is one guy who is about to graduate from Ohio State University after years and years of not being able to find a way to move forward. Here is another one. Patty McCarthy Metcalf of Faces and Voices of Recovery wrote in a letter today that taking out the CARA recovery provisions ``will prolong the crisis of addiction by not providing the critical support in communities across our nation where it is most needed. Recovery services provided by recovery community organizations, including recovery coaching and emergency rooms and drug courts and recovery education and awareness, are desperately needed and highly effective in getting people with addiction on a long-term path to recovery.'' What does she mean by all that? She means that these recovery coaches and the services that are supported by the CARA bill help people who might go, as she said, to an emergency room because they have an overdose to be confronted by somebody who says: Look, we can help you get better. You don't have to do this again. You don't have to overdose again. You don't have to go through this near-death experience. We can get you into a program where you can get treatment and recovery. Someone has to provide the resources for those coaches. We want those coaches. All of us as citizens should want them. We don't want people to keep overdosing again and again. We want to break that cycle. That is what our legislation would do. Patty makes the critical point that our response has to be comprehensive. I think she is right. She says: Prevention, treatment and enforcement cannot solve the opiate problem without recovery supports. National experts on addiction, and millions of people in recovery, will agree that a comprehensive approach is critical. That is what we do. CARA is comprehensive. There are 71 recovery groups, including the Ohio State University Collegiate Recovery Community, which sent a letter to the House Judiciary Committee and the Education and Workforce Committee today expressing concern that two sections of CARA which expand recovery supports for students in high school and in college were dropped out. These are amazing programs. I am so impressed with these brave young men and women who stand up and say: I have a problem. I have an addition. For other students at this high school or at this college, who, like me, have this addiction, have this disease, I want to help you. We should work together and come together in support groups. There did not use to be any of these hardly, as far as I know. Now there are a number of them. Ohio State University is one of the places that took the lead in this. I am so proud of those students who stood up and said: Despite the stigma around this, I am going to stand up and say that I have this problem, and I know many of you do too. If you do, come, and we can work together to work through this problem. Again, what they say is, ``We support a comprehensive approach to addressing this epidemic, which must include providing recovery supports that enable individuals to enter and sustain their recovery.'' Again, CARA is comprehensive. No other bill comes close. As this process moves forward, I hope we will insist that any final agreement represents a comprehensive approach because this epidemic has to be combated from all angles. The approach we took to writing CARA was to say we are going to take the best ideas regardless of where they come from. We don't care who brings them. We just care what the idea means to help address this problem. We had ideas from Democrats. We had ideas from Republicans. We had ideas from House Members, from Senators, from experts in law enforcement, and from patients in recovery. We didn't ask who had the idea, we asked if it was a good idea. That is how you cobble together good legislation that makes a difference in our communities. On Friday I was in Ohio chairing a hearing of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. It was at University Hospitals of Cleveland, OH. We heard from law enforcement experts such as the attorney general, Mike DeWine, and the acting U.S. attorney, Carole Rendon. She was great, as was Senator DeWine. Law enforcement, including the Fraternal Order of Police, has been strongly supportive of CARA because they believe this comprehensive approach works. We also provide training for the administering of this naloxone we talked about, the Narcan, and being sure that law enforcement has what they need to be able to help combat this issue. We also create these law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and methamphetamines. They want better tools, law enforcement does, so they can save lives. We owe them that. In Ohio I am that our first responders have used naloxone more than 16,000 times in the last year alone. Thank God for those first responders because they have saved thousands and thousands of lives. On Friday we also heard from Tracy Plouck from the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. We heard from Dr. Nancy Young of Children and Family Futures and Dr. Margaret Kotz, who is the director of Addiction Recovery Services at University Hospitals in Cleveland, one of the experts we have relied on. They talked about the recovery process. Their point was that probably 9 out of 10 people who need treatment are not getting it. That is a clear sign the status quo is not working. Some of it is the stigma we talked about earlier, people are not coming forward. Some of it is not having treatment programs that are accessible. We heard about waiting lists, sometimes 3 or 4 days, sometimes 14 days, sometimes a couple of months--and people being at that point in their lives where they are willing to come forward and say: I need to solve this problem. Yet there is a waiting list. Last night I had a tele-townhall meeting. We had 25,000 Ohioans on at any one time. It was a big group. People were talking about all kinds of issues, from the terrorist threat we face to energy and environment issues, to the jobs issue. One guy called in and he asked: What are you doing about treatment for people who have drug problems? So I told him about the CARA legislation and he seemed to have a quiver in his voice. I asked him: You seem to have a lot of interest in this and some information about it. Can you tell us your background? I thought perhaps he was a doctor or a treatment specialist. Unfortunately, he said what you hear more and more from parents, which is: I lost my child to addiction. She had an overdose. She died. And the reason I am so focused on treatment, Senator Portman, is because we got her to the place in her life where she was willing to go, finally, to a treatment center and get the treatment and recovery services she needed to deal with this disease that had gripped her--and there was no room at the inn. There was a waiting list. We couldn't get her in, and it was during that period that we couldn't get her into the treatment center that would have helped her that she overdosed. This is a caller from last night who--on a call--was willing to say this in front of 25,000 people. I told him I appreciated the fact that he had the courage to call in and the courage to talk about it. Of course, I expressed my sympathy to him and his family but asked him to continue talking about it, to channel that grief into something positive. Until we get more people into treatment, this is going to continue to be a huge problem in every one of our communities. Until we change the law, until we get legislation passed in Washington so we can be better partners, we are not going to be doing our part. Will Washington solve this problem? No. This problem is going to be solved in our communities, it is going to be solved in our families, and it is going to be solved in our hearts. We have to get people to pull away from this, to understand the dangers, better prevention and education. In our legislation, we have a prevention program to build awareness about the connection with prescription drugs and heroin. I bet most people listening [[Page S2446]] right now didn't know about that connection, a lot of people don't. Why would you, if you hadn't faced this issue? That awareness alone is going to make people make better decisions for themselves, for their children. Friday in Cleveland we had a man testify whose son died of an overdose. Do you know why? Because he had his molars--his wisdom teeth--taken out. When he had his wisdom teeth taken out, what happened? You know where I am going. They gave his son, a kid, Percocet--a narcotic, a painkiller. The rest of the story you know, which is he started taking more of those and more of those. Then he took some from the bathroom shelf of one of his relatives. He developed this addiction and eventually turned to heroin and overdosed. Now his father, God bless him, is out there talking to high schoolers, talking to middle schoolers, talking to young people about the dangers. We can address this issue. We know we can. There has been success with other awareness programs. Think of smoking and teen smoking. We have made great progress there. We have to make progress on this one. This is about life and death. We heard testimony on Friday from Dr. Michele Walsh, the director of neonatology at University Hospitals. She talked about how she is increasingly seeing babies who are born with what is called neonatal abstinence syndrome. That is a fancy way of saying these poor babies are born with an addiction. She said the symptoms are the same you would see with an adult. It is the fidgeting. It is the sweats. These are little babies. I have gone to these neonatal units, and I know some of my colleagues have. You see these babies. They are so small they can fit in the palm of your hand, and they are addicted. You have these doctors and nurses with incredible passion, such as Dr. Michele Walsh, who are taking care of them. In my home State of Ohio we have had a 750-percent increase in the last 12 years with babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome--a 750-percent increase. Every single neonatal unit in Ohio is facing this. I have been to Rainbow Babies & Children's in Cleveland, which is at this hospital. I have seen what they do. I have been to St. Rita's special care nursery in Lima, OH. I have been to Children's Hospital in my own hometown. They are doing great work, but wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to deal with this issue because we had better prevention and education to let mothers know what the danger is when they are pregnant and they could have better treatment and recovery to get those women out of this grip of addiction so their babies can be born without these issues. Frankly, the long-term effects we talked about at our hearing, talking to experts and doctors, I don't think people know what the long-term effects are--and of course that is scary. They basically take these babies through withdrawal. We have to provide babies with the medication at a lower level--but that you would provide an adult--to take them through the withdrawal process. CARA, the legislation we are talking about, would help these women. It would help these babies by expanding treatment for expectant and postpartum women as well as awarding grants to evidence-based treatment services and residential treatment programs for pregnant women who are struggling with addiction. It would create a pilot program to provide family-based services to women who are addicted to opiates in a nonresidential outpatient setting. It is what we learn from experts-- how to help address this problem--that is in this legislation. I know there are other ideas out there, and that is great, but stripping out some of CARA's core provisions just didn't make any sense to me. Let's keep it comprehensive. Let's be sure and get this legislation done and then work on additional legislation. The House could simply put CARA on the suspension calendar and have a vote on it. That is the calendar where you have to have a two-thirds vote, but something like this with all the cosponsors and all the interest in this issues now, I think it would pass. That means we are one vote away of getting this help to our communities. That is how close we are to a historic achievement to help begin to turn the tide, to make the Federal Government a better partner with our States, our local communities. Our great nonprofits are out there in the trenches doing the work and our families. There is no reason it couldn't happen today, tomorrow, or the next day before we go into another congressional recess. After 3 years of work, it doesn't make sense to start from scratch and try to rewrite this. Let's work together to come up with additional ideas that are course appropriate. Nobody has a monopoly on good ideas around here. Believe me, I know some of these House Members. They have the right intentions. They are trying to help. I appreciate that, but I also think we all need to appreciate the fact that this is a crisis. We are losing more and more Americans, 5,600 since CARA was passed in the Senate. Roughly every 12 minutes we lose someone else. People's lives are on the line. Communities are being impacted. Families are being torn apart. It is time for us to act and act quickly. I appreciate the time today. I urge the House to move quickly on this legislation so we can begin to help our communities in need. I yield back the remainder of my time. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ``El Faro'' Tragedy Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss, first of all, the successful location of the El Faro voyage data recorder by the NTSB. As you all recall, that was the ship that had sailed from Jacksonville and was lost at sea and everyone perished. Today, the NTSB found the data recorder. The U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy, and other search partners were also involved. That gives me hope that we will soon have more answers about this terrible disaster and how to prevent a similar one from happening again. So I want to thank the men and women of the investigative team who worked together to find this important piece of the El Faro puzzle. Today we are also reminded of those who were lost on the El Faro and the loved ones they left behind. They remain in our thoughts and prayers. Zika Virus Madam President, on a different topic, I wanted to come to the floor today and talk again about the Zika virus. Once again there was an announcement that there had been additional cases identified in Florida. Just to recap where we stand now, Zika has now spread to over 43 countries. There are 500 cases in U.S. territories, most of them on the Island of Puerto Rico. In my home State of Florida, there are now 93 cases--the most of any State--and the peak mosquito season is directly ahead. A lot has happened regarding Zika. We have learned more and more about this disease. For example, we are now learning the virus has a direct link to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a very debilitating, often fatal, illness, and it is striking people affected with it. We are learning through recent science that it is not just the first trimester of pregnancy but also potentially in the second trimester that unborn children can be impacted by this, and the impacts are devastating. We are learning that of the two species of mosquitoes that spread the disease, one of them has developed an immunity, a resistance to the most commonly used pesticide to remove them. So there is real concern as we head into the summer months and mosquitoes begin to appear that soon we will wake up to the news that there has now been a mosquito- borne transmission within the continental United States. Here is the bottom line: We don't know everything about this disease. We already know it is bad, but we don't know how bad it is. Every day we find out more things. We know during these summer months it will be increasingly warm in many parts of the country where the two mosquito species that spread the virus can be found--in 30 out [[Page S2447]] of 50 States. We know those mosquitoes tend to grow even faster during warm seasons and when there is a lot of water on the ground. And we know one of the countries most impacted by it--Brazil--will soon host the Summer Olympic Games, which means there is going to be a tremendous amount of travel to and from Brazil, and, in fact, there already is. We know the disease is not just spread through mosquitoes, but it is also sexually transmitted. The result of all this is that there is a real concern about what direction we are headed. The President has asked for $1.9 billion in funding, and I am generally supportive of that request. I believe we need to deal with these issues on the front end as quickly as possible. We don't want to wake up one morning to the realization that we are now in the middle of summer, this has become an epidemic or a catastrophe, and we didn't do anything on the front end. Everyone here will have to explain what their position was at the time. I also think you can be for Zika funding--you can even be for Zika funding at $1.9 billion--and you can also ask questions about how this money is going to be spent and, if possible, how we are going to pay for it because we are facing a debt situation in this country. I believe we can find $1.9 billion to pay for it. I have suggested some of my own. What we don't want to do is to play political games with this. I think it is important. On the one side, you can't just say: Look, I am against anything they are asking for that comes up unless you prove otherwise. I think it is important that we now admit this is a serious issue that needs to be confronted. But it is also not being an obstructionist to ask: How is the money going to be spent? What programs will be funded? Where is the prioritization going to be? I think it is not too much to ask to have a level of detail about that $1.9 billion. What I am concerned about is some of the reports in the news that there are games being played with this. We have heard the news that the administration has redirected $44 million in emergency preparedness grants promised to State and local governments this summer. Oftentimes in politics this is a very typical maneuver. What you do is, you cut money from an organization somewhere and you blame it on congressional inaction--or in the States, on legislative inaction. And they say the reason you are losing this money is that someone is not doing what we want, so you find the most painful, alarming cuts and use them as a leverage point to get pressure built on Congress. So I want to make sure that this is not part of some game. We shouldn't be playing games with this. I think it is also important to understand why, in addition to the $1.9 billion, they are also saying on top of that we also have to repay the $510 million in Ebola funds since the Ebola situation is now under control. These are all legitimate issues that need to be confronted. But in the end, we have to do something about this. I know the Senate and the Congress were not meant to move at warp speed, to say the least. It is a place in which action takes time, and I understand that. But there are things we don't have time for. This issue has to be dealt with on the front end. Summer is here already. If you have been in South Florida, as I have on weekends, and back in my home State, as I will be again this Friday and into the weekend, it is already hot. That heat, combined with a wet season, means mosquitoes. This is mosquito season. We have a disease that is already creating this catastrophic impact in countries neighboring us to the south. We know it is spread by mosquitoes. Mosquito season is rapidly approaching, and we have to get ahead of this. None of us wants to be in a position in June, July, and August where this thing breaks out and we start seeing cases in the continental United States, as we are already seeing in Puerto Rico and in Brazil, and we have no answer for why we did nothing during these months we were here. I don't know what all the impediments are. I know there are conversations going on at the committee level, but I hope we can bridge this rather quickly. There are so many other issues we can argue about. There are so many other issues we can have debates about in the partisan season. But I don't think a disease of this magnitude, with this level of risk, is one we should be playing games with. My hope is that cooler heads will prevail and that over the next few days we will find it within ourselves to find out how to appropriate the necessary money so we can begin to deal with this, at least on the front end. Maybe there is a chunk of money on the front end so we can begin to address it and then we can come back later and fund the rest of it. I think it is incumbent upon the administration and others to say ``This is what the money is going to be spent on'' so we can judge whether the money and the funds are actually going to things that work. But this needs to happen. This problem can't wait, and it shouldn't be a partisan fight. Combating Zika is an appropriate use of public dollars. It is an appropriate use of public dollars. I am for limited government. I am for a very limited Federal Government. But one of the things the Federal Government is tasked with is keeping our people and country safe, particularly from external threats. Traditionally, what that means is an invading army or some military threat from abroad or whatever. In this case, this is a threat emerging from abroad, but it is coming toward the United States. There is nothing that prevents the United States from becoming like some of these other countries that have been impacted by this--nothing. Our people are not genetically immune to Zika. It is a matter of time. It is not a question of if, it is a question of when there will be a mosquito-borne transmission of the Zika disease here in the United States. And when that happens, if the posture of the Congress has been that we did nothing--nothing has happened on this; we are still debating over $200 million or $50 million--people will not be satisfied with that answer. So my hope is that this is dealt with according to the level of urgency it deserves. As I said, in my home State of Florida we already have 93 cases, with 2 new ones over the weekend. Those numbers are only going to grow. It is just a matter of time before there is a mosquito- borne transmission somewhere in the United States--the continental United States, because, as I said, this has already occurred in Puerto Rico--and I hope we get ahead of it before it is too late. As I speak to the appropriators and those involved in this, my hope is that we can find our way forward on this rather quickly. There are so many other issues to argue about; this should not be one of them. The money needs to be spent the right way, but it needs to be spent and it needs to be appropriated, and we should endeavor to pay for as much of it, if not all of it, as we can. It needs to get quickly to the target. We need to move from this process and on to those programs so we can get ahead of it in May and June, before we get into the summer, before we get into mosquito season, and before we have an outbreak in the United States. If not, we then will have to answer to the people as to why nothing happened when we knew the risk was growing and the threat was emerging. With that, Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, it has been nearly 9 months since the United States had an Ambassador to Mexico. The President's nominee to that post, Roberta Jacobson, is eminently qualified for the post. The Arizona Republic noted in an editorial from March that ``she's qualified, respected and needed to do an important job.'' They are right. For more than 20 years, Ms. Jacobson has been immersed in the regional, political, economic, and security issues related to the Western Hemisphere. In fact, as part of her extensive background, she served for a time as Director of the Office of Mexican Affairs at the State Department. She is obviously [[Page S2448]] fluent in Spanish and has earned the respect of her colleagues. She served for 3 years as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Canada, Mexico, and NAFTA issues within the Bureau of Western Hemisphere--experience that would later serve the United States well given that Mexico is America's third largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totaling more than half a trillion dollars. However, she has been waiting for the Senate to confirm her nomination since the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported it to the Senate in November of last year by a vote of 12 to 7. It should be incomprehensible to anyone around the country to have a post of the top diplomat to one of our most important bilateral relations open for this long, but for Arizonans, it is particularly baffling. Arizona alone enjoyed a trade relationship with Mexico of nearly $17 billion last year. On the export side, Arizona exports about $9 billion in goods and services to Mexico every year, which, according to the Arizona Republic, ``accounts for 41 percent of the state's exports, and four times more than our state exports to our next biggest trading partner, Canada.'' According to the Arizona-Mexico Commission: With an economy that now surpasses $1.3 trillion, Mexico ranks as one of the top 20 economies in the world. Mexico's economy has been increasingly focused on manufacturing, particularly since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994. More than $1 billion in goods are exchanged between the United States and Mexico every day. But the U.S.-Mexico relationship is about more than just our economies; transportation issues, security threats, and natural resource management are just some of the fronts on which we cooperate with Mexico. The Arizona Republic notes that ``the Arizona Department of Transportation recently signed a memorandum of understanding to study ways to improve the trade corridor that spans the border.'' Arizona alone shares six ports of entry with Mexico, and Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport facilitates 122 flights a week to and from Mexico. All of this cooperation requires a close partnership between our two countries. The longer the United States goes without having an Ambassador to Mexico, the greater that partnership will suffer. To my knowledge, the holdup in this process is not based on any concrete concerns with the qualifications of this specific nominee. She enjoys overwhelming support. There is no reason not to move forward with this nomination. If there is opposition, then Members should have the opportunity to express it. As such, I will be asking unanimous consent for a time agreement with a rollcall vote on her confirmation. There is simply no reason we should not have an Ambassador to Mexico when we have a candidate as qualified as Roberta Jacobson. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 365; that there be 30 minutes for debate only on the nomination equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session without any intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Florida. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I agree that the U.S.-Mexico relationship is one of our most important bilateral relationships. We do need an ambassador in Mexico City who has a track record of effectively advancing U.S. interests. I do, however, have serious questions about the policies that Assistant Secretary Jacobson has pursued during her tenure in the Western Hemisphere Bureau. I have had conversations with the administration and others, such as Senator Corker, about the concerns, and I remain hopeful that we can find a way to resolve this issue in the very near future, but until then, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I plan to return frequently for as long as it takes to shed a light on this nomination and to make sure it moves forward, so I expect to be here tomorrow to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. World Intellectual Property Day Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the United States is one of the most dynamic and innovative countries in the world. Our Nation's success in areas such as agriculture, manufacturing, computer technology, and medicine can be traced in large measure to our respect for, and protection of, intellectual property. Every year on this day, April 26, we have the opportunity to recognize the important role of intellectual property rights in the fabric of our society when we celebrate World Intellectual Property Day. Nearly 230 years ago, our Founding Fathers recognized the importance of intellectual property and made provisions for its promotion and protection in the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause 8 empowers Congress ``to promote the Progress of Science and Useful arts, by securing, for limited Times, to Authors and Inventors, the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.'' Since that time--and stemming from these values--intellectual property has played a vital role in our economy, supporting jobs and advancing creative and scientific industries. In our modern, innovation economy, patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other forms of IP are more critical than ever. As the Global Intellectual Property Center recently pointed out in their broad survey of Intellectual Property in America, IP-intensive industries employ over 40 million Americans, accounting for 38 percent of total U.S. gross domestic product. Workers in IP-intensive industries are paid better than the national average, earning an average salary of over $50,000 compared to those in non-IP-intensive sectors where the average is roughly $39,000. In fact, intellectual property is so important to the American economy that the collective worth of all of the intellectual property in the United States is now above $5.8 trillion. In Iowa, we have seen how intellectual property has become an integral part of our economy. Our system of strong intellectual property protection has led to $11.2 billion in annual IP-related exports from the State, a total of 667,557 IP-related jobs, and 19.9 percent higher wages for direct IP workers than non-IP workers. Just as Iowans utilized strong IP laws 75 years ago when they were discovering how to feed the world through cutting-edge science, today's Iowans benefit from our system of IP protection as they start companies and create new tech success stories. The Judiciary Committee plays an important role in protecting intellectual property. The committee exercises jurisdiction over our Nation's intellectual property laws including those governing patents, trademarks, and copyrights. We consider legislation that helps to ensure that intellectual property rights continue to promote jobs and innovation. The committee also exercises important oversight of the Patent and Trademark Office, ICANN, the Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, and various law enforcement entities charged with protecting IP. Some recent examples of important legislation that helps promote intellectual property rights are the PATENT Act of 2015 and the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016. The PATENT Act, which passed the committee by a vote of 16 to 4 last June, takes important steps to stop abusive patent litigation practices. As bad actors are exploiting the high costs of litigation and using deceptive tactics to prey on businesses, it is important that this legislation be considered in the Senate. Just 3 weeks ago, the Senate unanimously passed the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, sponsored by Senators Hatch and Coons. Building upon the bipartisan consensus generated in the Judiciary Committee, the bill passed on the Senate floor by a vote of 87 to 0. It is estimated that the American economy loses 2.1 million jobs and over [[Page S2449]] $300 billion in economic losses every year because of trade secret theft. The Defend Trade Secrets Act brings much-needed uniformity to trade secret litigation. This will allow the creators and owners of trade secrets to more effectively address the growing problem of trade secret theft. The House of Representatives is expected to pass our bill this week and I hope it will be immediately signed by the President. Tomorrow, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on counterfeits and their impact on consumer health and safety. We will hear from a panel of experts, including witnesses from the Patent and Trademark Office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and industry. These businesses include companies that provide home health care products and equipment to our troops. They will discuss how counterfeits can harm consumers and what their impact is on the economy. We will hear how law enforcement is addressing this problem as well as how stakeholders are educating consumers to protect themselves from counterfeits. The focus of this year's World Intellectual Property Day is ``digital creativity.'' As the World Intellectual Property Organization notes, the current era of Internet connectivity is transforming how consumable culture such as films, TV, music, books, art, and other cultural works are created and distributed. This has led to radical changes in the way we access content and in how businesses operate. As challenges emerge as to how we protect intellectual property rights in these new economic models, we must continue to search for effective solutions that promote creativity across different mediums. So on this World Intellectual Property Day, it is important to once again recognize the significance of our Nation's robust system of intellectual property protection and enforcement. This system has helped create the United States' enduring role as a leader in innovation and creativity. As the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will continue to embrace my role as a promoter of intellectual property rights and American jobs. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,127883,127883,127951,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [senate] [pages s2434-s2449] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] energy and water development and related agencies appropriations act, 2016--continued the presiding officer. the senator from colorado. nomination of merrick garland mr. bennet. mr. president, i rise to discuss the vacancy on the supreme court and the majority's ongoing refusal to consider the nomination of chief judge merrick garland. forty days have passed since the president of the united states nominated judge garland to fill justice scalia's seat. this is longer than it took for the senate to confirm justice sandra day o'connor in 1981. in fact, 75 percent of all supreme court justices have been confirmed within 31 days, but today-- 40 days after his nomination--many senators haven't even extended judge garland the simple courtesy of a meeting. the majority's refusal to hold a vote is without precedent, and the majority has cited none. instead, the majority is trying to shift the blame. incredibly, the chairman of the judiciary committee recently came to the floor to blame, of all people, not other senators, not other politicians, but the chief justice of the united states of america for politicizing the court. ten days before justice scalia's death, the chief justice said: ``the process is not functioning very well.'' that turns out to have been something of an understatement. the chief justice went on and said that the process ``is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees.'' again, he was not referring to what is going on now in the senate. this happened before justice scalia passed away. there was no way that the chief justice could have known there was going to be a vacancy. he continued: ``[supreme court justices] don't work as democrats or republicans . . . and i think it's a very unfortunate impression the public might get from the confirmation process.'' his words struck me--particularly given what has gone on since then-- as a candid expression of his concern for the court as an institution. this concern apparently upset the chairman of the judiciary committee. he took to the floor and said: the chief justice has it exactly backwards. the confirmation process doesn't make the justices appear political. he continued: the confirmation process has gotten political precisely because the court has drifted from the constitutional text, and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences. it is absolutely breathtaking that the chief justice would be criticized for ``drifting from the constitutional text'' when, for the past 10 weeks, the majority has drifted from article ii, section 2, clause 2, which sets out our constitutional responsibility to advise and consent in very clear terms. worse, the majority's drift isn't even about policy; it is about politics. it is about rolling the dice on an election instead of following the plain text of the constitution. this is absolutely unprecedented in the history of the senate. throughout our history, the senate has confirmed 17 nominees in presidential election years to serve on the supreme court. the last of these was justice kennedy in 1988. when the president made this nomination, he had more than 340 days left in his term. we are talking almost a quarter of the president's term. that is a lot more time than most of those 17 justices had before this senate. in the last 100 years, every nominee to a supreme court vacancy who did not withdraw--and a couple did--received a timely hearing and vote. on average, the senate has begun hearings within 40 days of the president's nomination and voted to confirm 70 days after the president's nomination. there is no excuse for not holding a hearing and a vote. if that is what we are going to pay attention to in this chamber and if that is what we are going to argue for--originalism, strict constructionism--the plain language of the constitution is clear. there is a reason why no senate has ever had the audacity to do what this senate is doing right now--because of how clear that mission is and because there is no one else to do it. the constitution says: the senate shall advise and consent. it doesn't say: the house of representatives shall have a role. it doesn't say: let the people decide. it says that this is the senate's job. we should do our job just as every senate, until now, has done its job since the founding of the country, including the senate that was there when george washington was in office. three of those 17 appointments were confirmed by a senate that actually contained people who had been at the constitutional convention, and they were consistent with their understanding of what the founders had agreed to. they had a vote on the floor of the senate. i am not saying how people should vote. they should vote their conscience, but we should have a vote. the american people expect us to do our job. i want to be clear that i believe there should be hearings. i think we should go through hearings to establish the qualifications of the nominee. i think that is really important. the point i am making about having this vote does not have to do with whom the president nominated. it has to do with our institutional responsibility. it has to do with the rule of law and the image we want to project to our country and overseas. finally, i have a word to say about the president's nominee. merrick garland is an honored and accomplished judge. two weeks ago i had the opportunity to meet with him and learn about his judicial record and philosophy. i have known chief judge garland for more than 20 years. i have actually worked for him at the justice department when we both worked for the deputy attorney general of the united states. i was fresh out of law school, but even then judge garland's humility, work ethic, and commitment to the rule of law inspired me and continue to inspire me. our meeting last week confirmed what i already know. judge garland is an intelligent and pragmatic judge who is extraordinarily well- qualified to serve on the supreme court. i have wondered whether that is the reason the majority is not holding hearings. they could simply hold the hearings and vote against judge garland, which is their prerogative. why not hold hearings? maybe they know that the american people, given the opportunity to hear directly from judge garland, would see that he is precisely the type of judge who should serve on the court. a vacancy on the supreme court is a rare thing. it doesn't come around very often. for those of us in this country, whether we are in the senate or in a classroom somewhere, those vacancies, hearings, and debates on the floor present an unparalleled opportunity--a remarkable opportunity--for the american people to engage in a debate about the court, the constitution, and all kinds of issues that the court will consider. that is what these hearings are about. that is what could be going on this summer during this presidential election year, and we would have a discussion about where we want to head as a country. we are not having it. we are not having it because of this unprecedented action. because of what the majority has done here, by not meeting with the nominee or holding a hearing, they are denying him the opportunity to make his case to the american people. in the meantime--and this is really critical--the court will continue to be impaired. impaired is the word that justice scalia himself used when he was asked to recuse himself from a case involving dick cheney, then the vice president of the united states. in that case, he was asked if there would be a presumption of recusal. justice scalia's answer [[page s2435]] to that was this: maybe if i were on the court of appeals--because if i were on the court of appeals, there would be somebody to replace me, but that is not how it works on the supreme court. when there is a vacancy on the supreme court, leaving the court with only eight justices, there is nobody who can fill in. there is nobody to become the ninth justice. he said that the court would therefore be impaired. the action that is being taken right now threatens to impair the supreme court not for one session but for two sessions of the court before there is another election. in fact, for the third time since justice scalia's death, the supreme court could not resolve a dispute because of a 4-to-4 split. the longer this vacancy remains, the more uncertainty and confusion the american people will suffer. as i said, two terms of the court will be jeopardized by petty politics. believe me, i know it has become fashionable for washington to tear down rather than work to improve the democratic institutions that generations of americans have built, but to so cavalierly impair the judicial branch of our government is pathetic. it is time for the senate to do its job as every senate has done before us. again, i am not asking my colleagues to support judge garland's nomination. that is a matter of conscience for each of us. but we must fulfill our basic constitutional obligation of holding a hearing and a vote. this is literally--because it is in the constitution and no one else is granted this power--the least we can do to demonstrate that we are a legislative body that functions as the constitution requires. we certainly have plenty of time. in view of that, if by contrast we leave for our scheduled 7 weeks of summer vacation--which is not enshrined in the constitution but is a schedule that is set by the senate--without having fulfilled our responsibility, the american people should demand that we return to washington and do our job. it is past time for my colleagues to meet with judge garland, hold hearings on his record, and give the american people an up-or-down vote on this judicial vacancy. i thank the presiding officer. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senate majority whip. the appropriations process mr. cornyn. mr. president, i fear that sometimes here in the senate we get bogged down in the minutia and the process and don't really talk about the why of how things are done here. we talk a lot about the how, but we don't talk about the why. i just want to speak for a couple of minutes about why it is so important that we pass the regular appropriation bills and put what we are trying to do here in a larger context. our colleagues will remember that last year we were unable to pass the 12 regular appropriation bills because our democratic colleagues filibustered those pieces of legislation in order to force a negotiation to raise the spending caps on discretionary spending. i regret that. i wish it hadn't happened, but it did and there is not much we can do about it. but in the process, what happened is that we ended up having to pass a fiscal year-end omnibus appropriations bill that lacked any basic transparency. there was about $1 trillion-plus worth of spending, and i think most people's reaction is this: why do you have to do business in such a terrible way that lacks transparency, doesn't let people know what is in the bill, and doesn't let all 100 senators contribute to the product? the reason is because our democratic colleagues blocked those bills. i hope it is different this year because now those top-line numbers for discretionary spending are fixed in law. what we are trying to do, starting with the energy and water appropriations bill that senator alexander and senator feinstein are working through the legislative process, is to begin the process of passing those regular appropriation bills. i hope and trust we will conclude with this piece of legislation this week and then we will move on to the next legislative vehicle, which will probably be the transportation, housing, and urban development legislation, the so-called thud bill around here. we have actually demonstrated that by providing an open process, we can actually get some things done. we all recall last congress--a year and a half ago. the fact of the matter is that a decision had been made by the then-majority leader, senator reid, not to allow senators to participate in the amendment process on the floor. as a consequence, it wasn't just those of us in the minority who were prohibited from offering legislation that would actually improve the product that was on the floor, it included members of his own political party. so they had to go home at election time and explain to their constituents back home: i may be in the majority, but i couldn't get an amendment voted on, on the senate floor. having learned from that experience, senator mcconnell and we decided that the best thing to do is to have an open process by which members of the majority party and minority party, democrats and republicans alike--anybody who has a good idea--can come forward and get a vote on that legislation. we had a couple of recent bipartisan successes. yes, i know in some corners ``bipartisanship'' is a dirty word, but the fact is, you can't get anything done around here unless it is bipartisan. our constitution was written in a way to force consensus to be built. in an absence of consensus, nothing gets done. so we have had a couple of recent successes, in addition to our work on appropriations bills, including the energy policy modernization act. one of the most important parts of that legislation from my perspective is that back in texas we saw an expedited process for the approval of liquefied natural gas export terminals. that is very important to our economy and something that takes advantage of an incredible resource we have in america--natural gas--which we would like to sell to our allies and friends around the world when they don't have it. that is something that builds jobs in america. it helps grow our economy. it helps provide a lifeline to many of our allies around the world, for whom energy is being used simply as a weapon by people like vladimir putin. we also voted to reauthorize the federal aviation administration bill. obviously, this is important for public safety--to make sure our skies are safe--but also to provide the appropriate regulatory regime for the airline industry. looked at individually, these bills may not seem like an end-all or be-all, but they are part of a bigger picture and part of a larger goal, which is getting this legislative body back to work again, as it was meant to do, considering and passing legislation that will impact our country for the better. don't get me wrong. sometimes the right answer is to stop bad ideas. sometimes the right idea is to stop bad ideas, but where there is an opportunity for consensus and where we can actually craft something that helps move our country forward--i believe all 100 senators came here with that sort of goal in mind. the bottom line is, we are working again to advance the priorities of the american people. in the same way we debate and discuss the energy and water appropriations bill, we have to keep the bigger picture in mind. it is not just about passing a single appropriations bill or to check items off our to-do list, it is part of a larger process, which is to fund the federal government in a fiscally responsible way, hopefully--that is our goal--and to make sure we review the programs that are funded by federal appropriations and make sure they are still the priorities we believe they should be. if they aren't, then they shouldn't be funded. that is part of the process--to go back and look at what the programs are, whether they are still working, whether they are still necessary, and if they are not working or no longer necessary, then we simply no longer fund those as part of the appropriations process. we know this sets our country's priorities by giving guidance on everything we support--from our veterans to how we provide for our energy structure needs, to how we equip and train our troops. funding the government is actually one of the most important and basic duties of the congress. as the senator from tennessee has pointed out, one of the biggest problems we have--one we are not going to solve here today or this week, unfortunately--is that so much of the money [[page s2436]] that gets spent by the federal government is on autopilot--so-called mandatory spending. in other words, it is not even subject to the appropriations process in the senate. currently, only about one-third of the money the federal government spends actually goes through this sort of transparent and open process, where everybody knows what is going on and can offer their input. the rest of the money is spent on autopilot, and it is projected to rise, according to one recent projection i saw, at a rate of roughly 5.3 percent over the next 30 years. we know that is far beyond the rate of inflation, and it is an unsustainable amount of spending. some of the most important programs that are government funded, such as medicare or social security, cannot be sustained at the current level of spending unless we do everything we can within our ability to shore them up and save them for the next generation. that is what we actually need to be doing in the larger picture. until that day, we can continue to do what we can to deal responsibly with discretionary spending, and that is what we are trying to do. if we don't deal with these appropriations bills in a methodical and deliberate sort of way--all 12 of them--we are going to find ourselves at the end of september, at the end of the fiscal year, back in the same situation we were in last year--with the need for an omnibus appropriations bill or a continuing resolution, which is something i know there is not a lot of appetite for. zika virus mr. president, let me just say a word about the zika virus and the emergency funding request made by the president. some of our colleagues--notably the democratic leader and the democratic whip-- talked about this this morning and raised the question of whether we are going to responsibly deal with this threat of the zika virus. i can tell my colleagues we will. we are committed on a bipartisan basis to try to make sure we respond responsibly both from a public safety point of view and from a fiscal point of view. the president requested $1.9 billion. thankfully, there is money that has been identified that was left over from the ebola threat--some $500 million--that can be used as a downpayment to make sure our world-class scientists, like the ones i have met at the university of texas medical branch in galveston and just this last week at the texas medical center, are doing the research that is necessary in order to identify how to stop this threat by controlling the mosquitoes that bring it into the country. we know the mosquito that carries the zika virus is common in more temperate and warmer parts of the country, and that is why it has been primarily a threat in brazil and places like haiti and puerto rico. we also know that in places like texas, florida, and louisiana, this mosquito is present and there are already established cases of zika, primarily occurring in, i believe, either people who have traveled to central america or south america and who have been bitten and brought it back with them or, in the case of--apparently it has now been discovered that this virus can be sexually transmitted. so one of the things we need to make sure of, particularly for every woman of child-bearing age, is that they get the sort of protection they need so these horrific birth defects that we have seen in the news don't occur. we are all committed to doing that. we also ought to make sure we don't overshoot our goal and write a blank check for something when we don't even know what the plan of attack is. in some ways, this is like the president asking us to fund a war without telling us what his strategy is for fighting and winning that war. i think that is the sort of commonsense question our constituents want us to ask, and which we should ask. i realize not everything is knowable. hopefully, within a couple of years, our scientific community will have developed a vaccine which can protect people from this virus, but in the meantime we need to continue to fund the basic research. we need to continue to fund at the local level the mosquito eradication, and we need to keep our eye on this emerging threat. we can do that, and we will do that in a responsible sort of way. we don't need our colleagues on the democratic side to say we have to do it right here, right now, without even having a plan from the administration on how we will fight and win this war against the zika virus and hold up the regular appropriations process. i can tell from the saber-rattling going on from some of my colleagues across the aisle that they are looking for a reason to disrupt the regular appropriations process and that can be a mistake. first of all, it will not accomplish anything that can't otherwise be accomplished in terms of funding our research and the fight against the zika virus. we are committed to doing that in a bipartisan sort of way but in a responsible sort of way that doesn't add to the national debt and pass the bill on to the next generation, as well as a proportional response to the threat. just throwing money at it without a plan does not seem like a responsible thing to do. i implore our colleagues across the aisle, do not try to use the zika crisis to hold hostage our ability to do our regular appropriations work. it is too important to avoid the year-end omnibus appropriations bill that nobody says they like, and it is important for us to demonstrate--as we have tried to and i believe succeeded in doing, in large part--that we can continue to do our work day in and day out on a bipartisan, responsible basis, not that we are all going to agree on everything--that is just not the way people are built--nor do they want us to agree on everything. this is the place where we have the great debates on the issues that confront our country, both now and in the future, and that is appropriate. nobody should take it personally. we need to have those debates. we need to have those verbal confrontations so we can get to the truth and figure the best path forward for the country. so we are not here to kick the can down the road. we are here to do the nation's business, and we are here to deliver results to the american people. i hope we can continue to do that by carefully discussing, debating, and then voting on all 12 appropriations bills. in addition to talking about how, i hope to explain a little bit of the why it is so important that we do this now in order to avoid that year-end rush to an omnibus appropriations bill later on. mr. president, i don't see any other senators seeking recognition, so i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. portman. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. cornyn). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. portman. mr. president, first, to the majority whip, i thank him for his comments on the zika virus. he is absolutely right to raise awareness of that issue. it is a great concern. in ohio we happen to have some military assets that have been used in the past for aerial spraying, and i know they are interested in being even more involved in some of the eradication of some of these mosquitoes in the southern part of the country that may end up causing some of this infection. it is a very serious matter, and i am glad to know the appropriations committee is working on it as well as our authorizing committees. i know the senator from texas has a personal interest in this. i rise to speak about the underlying legislation--the energy and water appropriations bill. i thank the chairman of that committee, senator alexander, for working with me to include a couple of important provisions for the state of ohio. one is the cleanup of what is known as the portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant. this is a site that for half a century enriched uranium. this uranium was used by our navy, for our military, and for other purposes, including our nuclear arsenals, but it also has been used for our powerplants. so for decades the people in piketon, oh, have been helping keep americans safe and also helping thousands of ohioans to keep the lights on and to stay warm at a reasonable cost. now we have to clean up this facility. we moved on to other technology. it is an efficient [[page s2437]] technology, but it is a heck of a cleanup removing all this gaseous diffusion material and properly disposing of it. this cleanup effort employs about 2,000 ohioans. they are doing their job and doing it very well. we have to support them. unfortunately, over the years they have not gotten the support they deserve. in a 2008 campaign trip to ohio, the president gave a commitment that he would accelerate that cleanup. frankly, that just hasn't happened under the president's budget, so every year we have to fight for more funding to be sure that we can continue the cleanup, which is so important, but also to ensure that we aren't losing jobs in pike county. we just had this tragic occurrence where we had four different homes where family members were present during the horrible shooting out there in pike county. this is one of the counties in ohio that have relatively high unemployment. it is a county that has a lot of economic issues. these 2,000 jobs are good-paying jobs with good benefits, so it is very important that we keep the jobs there. just as importantly, it is the right thing to do for the taxpayers because as the obama administration has pulled back funding for this cleanup, it ends up costing the taxpayers more because delaying this cleanup ends up adding huge additional costs as funding is cut back and there is less cleanup going on. our analysis shows that an accelerated cleanup could save the taxpayers $4 billion, getting this done and moving the site on to commercial use. having adequate funding will save the taxpayers money. second, cleaning up the radioactive waste and other hazardous waste there is incredibly important for the community. it makes that site cleaner, of course, and is better for the environment. it is important for the community and these people who have for many years been providing us with the enriched uranium for our military and for our powerplants to know they are not going to be left with this environmental problem. third, these are good-paying jobs in a county that really needs them. finally, we owe it to the community to clean up the site so they can redevelop it. they want to reindustrialize this site, and it is a great location to do maybe an energy project or maybe a nuclear powerplant at some point and other exciting opportunities, but they have to clean up what is there in order for the site to be used for that. the people of piketon have helped shore up our economy and our national defense. we owe it to them to clean up this site. i am pleased that in this legislation we are considering an increase of $20 million over this year's level of cleanup work and an additional $20 million over this year's level for constructing a needed onsite disposal cell. we are at the point where we need to dispose of this material, and we need more money for that disposal cell. i am hoping that the house will increase the funding for the disposal cell even more, and if so, we will work in conference to get that number up further because that makes a lot of sense in order to actually move forward on this cleanup for all the reasons i have stated. again, i thank the chairman, senator alexander, for his help on this. one thing the chairman knows well is that part of the funding for the cleanup work comes from the department of energy's barter of uranium. i ask that as we move forward with the completion of this legislation over the next few months, if the price of uranium should change--should drop--that the chairman continue to work with us to ensure that there are no job losses and to ensure that the cleanup work is not delayed as it has been in the past. second, i thank the chairman for including another provision that is incredibly important to ohio and to lake erie. for many years the army corps of engineers has been dredging the cuyahoga river. it is necessary to do that for commercial purposes. they have a big steel plant there, which anybody who comes to the republican convention will see. it is very important, for that plant and other commercial purposes, to keep this waterway open for boat traffic, including bringing iron ore in for the steel mills. unfortunately, the u.s. army corps of engineers wants to take the dredge from the river and dump it into lake erie. time and time again, the ohio environmental protection agency and others have said this is not good for the environment. specifically, the dredge has pcb material. the pcb pollutants get into the fish, and the ohio epa has told them that if they keep dumping it into the lake, at some point they will have to issue a warning that the walleye in lake erie, which is our great game fish, is not to be eaten more than a certain number of times per month. this would kill the fishing industry. it is also the wrong thing to do with all the algal bloom problems we have in the lake because that is driven by nitrogen and phosphorous mostly, and those nutrients would get into the lake through this dumping. so we are saying: let's use an onsite disposal facility. we have one on land that they can use. they are refusing to do that. the army corps of engineers has gone so far as to, in the last appropriations bill, actually cut their own funding--which is something i have never seen before--to not be able to meet the requirement we put into law, saying that they have to provide for the disposal of this product not into the lake but onto a land facility. we have now worked with chairman alexander to include language in this legislation before us. senator sherrod brown and i were successful in getting that in last year. once again we are working with the chairman to get that language in this year. i thank senator alexander for including it. it maintains the requirement that ensures that the corps uphold its funding obligations to dispose of this dredge material upland and not in the lake. again, it concerns me that the corps seems to want to try to get around this. in fact, instead of putting money into the operations and maintenance account, as they are required to do to comply with not just what congress says but, frankly, what the court has ordered them to do--because the court has consistently said they have to dredge and then dump on land, they have actually put that into a risky position by saying they don't need the funding. they have gone so far as to indicate that maybe other dredging projects on lake erie or other lake erie funding could be in jeopardy of not receiving the full amount of money they need if there is a need to dispose of this on land. there is a better way. the corps should request use of unallocated funds provided by congress in order to dispose of the dredge material at cleveland harbor safely without putting other projects at risk. they can do that. our permanent subcommittee on investigations, which i chair, is currently investigating whether the corps intentionally requested a decrease in funding in last year's spending bill so that they would have no choice but to dump this dredge material into the harbor. i hope that is not true. i hope we find out that is not what happened, but there are indications of that. again, doing so would threaten the health of the area, the city of cleveland, lake erie's ecosystem, and specifically our fishing industry in lake erie, which is so critical to economic growth in that area. lake erie is the most productive of all of our great lakes in terms of fishing. it has a $6 billion fishing industry and is the no. 1 tourist attraction in ohio. i urge the corps to revise its work plan for this year to request the additional funds necessary to safely dispose of the dredge sediment at the cleveland harbor during the 2016 dredging season if, as i suspect, the federal judge again rules that the corps cannot place it in lake erie. i urge them to work with us to come up with a solution so we can have this dredge material disposed of on land and actually recycle that material so that it has value. a couple of weeks ago when i was at the site, i saw how some of the material is being mixed with other fill and being used not just for landfill but also for gardens and for farming and agriculture purposes. this is a way to take the dredge and to actually have it have value and be able to recycle it. mr. president, i thank the presiding officer for allowing me to give this statement today and for his patience. i also thank chairman alexander and others who have worked with us on this so that we can indeed be sure that we clean up this site and that we are able to get this dredge material coming out [[page s2438]] of the cuyahoga river onto a site on land to avoid the environmental damage that would otherwise occur. i yield back my time. the presiding officer. the senator from hawaii. mr. schatz. thank you, mr. president. i ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 17 minutes. the presiding officer (mr. portman). without objection, it is so ordered. zika virus mr. schatz. mr. president, i first want to talk about the zika public health emergency that is coming to the united states of america. we have to act now to fund the administration's request of $1.9 billion in supplemental funding. zika is a disease carried by the aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector that has already caused a dengue epidemic in my state of hawaii. the aedes mosquitoes are in more places than we previously thought throughout the united states. zika is the first mosquito-borne illness to be associated with a congenital birth defect. we are continuing to learn more about this devastating disease every day, including its association with guillain- barre syndrome--a type of paralysis--eye abnormalities, and more. while there have not yet been any locally transmitted diseases of zika in the continental united states, we do have hundreds of travel- related cases and up to 500 cases of active transmission in puerto rico, american samoa, and the u.s. virgin islands. as i mentioned, hawaii is recovering from a dengue epidemic. so we must provide emergency funding for mosquito-borne illnesses, and we must do it now. this is an emergency. the administration has clearly laid out its request to combat zika, which includes the following: $830 million for the cdc. this money would include grants and technical assistance to puerto rico and the u.s. territories and help our domestic and international response activities; about $250 million for the centers for medicare and medicaid services, or cms, to increase the federal match rate to puerto rico; and several hundred million dollars for the national institutes of health and barda to invest in vaccine research and development. that is the long-term solution. there is a high degree of competence that we will be able to get a vaccine but not without the funding. this is an absolute emergency. we need $10 million for the fda vaccine and diagnostics development and review, which is absolutely critical--we don't have diagnostic tests that are quite as efficient and effective as we are eventually going to need--and $335 million for usaid efforts abroad in public health infrastructure. i was fortunate to visit the cdc in atlanta a couple of weeks ago to learn more about their efforts to combat zika, dengue, and other vector-borne diseases. i saw firsthand how the cdc has activated its level 1 emergency operations center to combat zika. during my questions at the labor-hhs appropriations hearings, i heard how the cdc is strapped for funds and has already programmed its ebola funds and how these ebola funds are critically needed to prevent another ebola crisis. i have total confidence in the cdc, but they need this emergency funding request to be granted. we are about to go on a 1-week recess. there is no reason that we can't at least get on the supplemental this week. this is an absolute emergency. there are a lot of things we are doing that are important this week in terms of individual appropriations bills, but let's be clear: none of these appropriations bills are going to pass in the next week or even the next month. we still have the house that needs to take action, and there is no doubt we are going to go to conference. so in terms of whatever other legislative vehicles are pending or about to be pending, there is no urgency for us to move to those instead of what is happening right now in terms of a public health emergency with zika. this is an absolute emergency. the reason this is not smashing through every headline online, on television, in the newspapers, and on the radio is that it is still cold outside in a lot of places and the mosquitoes haven't come out. this is about to be a very serious public health crisis. for those of us who have differing views about the size and scope of government, i just want to say this: we have arguments about the epa's role, about the department of human services' role, about the department of education's role, and the size and scope of government across the board, but can't we agree that government's basic job is to protect its citizens, and can't we agree that the cdc is one of the best agencies in the government across the board, and can't we agree that this is a real emergency and ought not to wait until may or june or july and ought to be taken up immediately? mr. president, this is an emergency, and we ought to fund the supplemental on a big bipartisan vote. trans-pacific partnership mr. president, i would like to talk about the trans-pacific partnership. many promises were made about the tpp. before the final text was available, i received dozens of phone calls from advocates of the deal asking for my support. they said that this trade agreement was going to be different; that it would raise standards rather than lower them; and that my concerns about labor, the environment, climate change, public health, and consumer protection would be addressed. but since the text was released, i have read it, and unfortunately this deal does not turn out to be any different from the previous deals. it looks like just another race to the bottom. proponents claimed that the labor and environment chapters would contain enforceable commitments, and i know a lot of people worked very hard to make that true. but when you look closely at the wording of these chapters, you see that the commitments are basically just strongly worded suggestions. there are very few requirements. instead, the countries have promised to ``promote,'' ``encourage,'' ``cooperate,'' ``strive,'' and ``endeavor'' to do various things. i have no clue how one can enforce an obligation to encourage something or discourage something. many of the provisions contain this weak language, carefully written by lawyers to be unenforceable. here are a few examples from the environment chapter, which is particularly weak. first, the chapter opens with a general commitment that ``each party shall strive to ensure that its environmental laws . . . provide for, and encourage, high levels of environmental protection.'' that is right; they are to ``strive to ensure.'' on transitioning to a low-emissions economy, ``parties shall cooperate to address matters of joint or common interest.'' there is nothing more on climate change whatsoever. on marine animal conservation, ``each party shall promote the long- term conservation'' of sharks and various marine animals through ``such measures'' considered appropriate. i don't even know what that means. what is clear is that none of this is enforceable. so the problem is, no accountability. there is no requirement that countries meet their obligations before congress has to vote on the agreement and no independent verification of whether those obligations are ever met. we will vote to open our markets on day one to goods made under terrible labor and environmental conditions and hope that over time, after we have forfeited our leverage, these countries will implement and enforce the kinds of labor laws our country has had for decades. what this means is that we are giving them the deal, and after we forfeit all of our leverage, we hope they will see the light and do the right thing. take vietnam as an example. the economic benefits to vietnam of reduced or eliminated u.s. duties are enormous. importers from vietnam currently pay around $2 billion in annual tariffs. most of that comes from imports of apparel and footwear--industries that frequently utilize forced and child labor. although vietnam is supposed to comply on day one with the labor side agreement it signed with the united states, there is no independent verification. the side agreement sets up a long process of consultation before punitive action can be taken. at that point, vietnam will already be enjoying the benefit of the elimination of the tariff, and the united states will have lost jobs that cannot compete [[page s2439]] with forced child labor. no punitive action will bring back those jobs. now let's talk about the enforcement side. our track record, unfortunately, is not good. in the limited instances in which there are enforcement mechanisms in our trade agreements, we rarely utilize them. recently, the gao reported a systemic failure to enforce labor and environmental commitments across several trade agreements, even in light of compelling evidence of violations. the reason for this is that we don't really provide the resources for enforcement. but more importantly, there is a real lack of political will. for instance, the inclusion of malaysia in this trade zone gives us insight into the lack of political will. when we debated fast-track authority last year, congress agreed on an important negotiating objective: no trade deals with countries that earn the worst human trafficking ranking, according to the u.s. state department. this seems like something everyone ought to agree to. at the time, this included malaysia, which had the lowest ranking. but just after fast-track became law, malaysia's ranking was upgraded--to the surprise of human rights experts everywhere. the upgrade allowed the circumvention of congress's will and the continued inclusion of malaysia in tpp. this came just a few months after the discovery of human cages and 130 graves at a human trafficking detention camp on the malaysia-thailand border. against this backdrop, it is hard to have confidence that we will ever prioritize labor rights, human rights, or environmental protection over commercial interests. i am also deeply concerned about the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions, or isds for short. isds provides a special forum outside of our court system that is just available to foreign investors. these investors are given the right to sue governments over laws and regulations that impact their businesses--a legal right that is not granted to a labor union, an individual, or anyone else. here is how it works: if a decision is made by a national government that is contradicted by a provision in a trade agreement, the trade agreement wins. if a law that we pass contradicts a provision in tpp, tpp trumps our law. corporations are increasingly seeing this as a viable legal strategy to increase profits and undermine public health and environmental and labor protections. the isds forum is not available to anyone other than foreign corporations. it is not open to domestic businesses, labor unions, civil societies, or individuals who allege a violation of a trade agreement obligation. the arbitrators in isds who preside over these cases are literally not accountable to anyone. their decisions cannot be appealed. by profession, the arbitrators usually make their living working as lawyers for multinational corporations. the arbitrators cannot force the government to change its laws, but they can order the government to pay the investor when they lose money as a result of a law that contradicts a trade agreement, which can have the same effect. it is one thing for the united states to decide to pay a penalty to keep a law in place, but small countries cannot afford to go up against these multinational corporations in the isds context. not only will they repeal their national laws, they sometimes will not enact national laws knowing that they will be subject to fines under this isds process. the government often agrees to change the law or regulation that is being challenged, in addition to paying compensation. the threat of a case can be enough to convince a government to back away from legitimate public health, safety, or environmental policies. the practical implication is potentially sweeping. isds could prevent us from addressing climate change, raising the minimum wage, protecting consumers from harmful products, or preventing another financial crisis. each time we pass a law or regulation to improve the lives of the american people, foreign investors will effectively have the final say. these risks are not theoretical. in fact, for the united states, the risk of isds has become very real. in january, transcanada--the canadian company behind the keystone xl pipeline--filed a claim against the u.s. government under nafta's isds provisions for failing to approve the pipeline. if transcanada wins, taxpayers--u.s. taxpayers-- would be on the hook for $15 billion in damages being demanded by foreign corporations. make no mistake. this is a new strategy for fossil fuel companies to challenge laws and regulations that are attempting to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. there are hundreds of billions of dollars at stake, and with that on the line, you have to believe that law firms are spending hours systematically scouring every trade and investment agreement for provisions they can use to invalidate federal law. this is the legal strategy to bust up laws designed to protect public health, the environment, and consumers. corporate interests should not be the driving force for public policy decisions. yet that is exactly what this trade agreement would allow. a lot of us had hopes that this trade agreement would be different, but in a lot of ways, it is the same as the bad agreements that have come before it, and in some ways, it is actually worse. we are forfeiting valuable leverage across a huge area of the asia pacific that we could have used to lift labor and environmental conditions and level the playing field for our workers. this is not a question of whether you are for trade or whether you believe we should be engaged in the pacific region, it is a question of how. this deal is, unfortunately, a lowest common denominator agreement. for these reasons, i must oppose the tpp. i yield the floor. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). the senator from wyoming. the republican-led senate mr. barrasso. mr. president, i head home to wyoming just about every weekend. lots of people from wyoming come here to washington to visit as well. when i am home, i get a chance to talk to people, and here in washington, i get to talk to people. so yesterday is a day i flew here. i had talked to folks in wyoming early in the morning and then yesterday afternoon got off the plane, and there were a number of students here from sheridan high school from ``we the people.'' one of our pages here is also from that high school. so you get to hear a lot from people. some folks have been asking: what has the republican congress actually accomplished? so i would like to take a few minutes to talk a little bit about what the senate has actually done this year and during this congress since the republicans have taken over the majority. we are not even 4 months into this year, and we have already had a very productive year in the senate. it is true. we have been active, we have been effective, and it is only april. in february, we passed legislation to add tough new sanctions against north korea. as the presiding officer knows, the president in the white house was very reluctant when we started proposing these sanctions-- hesitant about the sanctions that we proposed against north korea. let's face it. north korea has been aggressively testing missiles, testing nuclear weapons, and needs to be stopped. when other countries threaten their neighbors, as north korea has done in their general geographic area, what happens is the united states must stand up and stop them. president obama has done far too little. i am very concerned about the aggression and the ambitions of north korea. that is why the senate had to act. so congress has stood up and pushed against this action. we had more action against north korea; that is exactly what we did. the senate also acted by passing a defend trade secrets act to help businesses protect their confidential information. we passed a piece of legislation called the comprehensive addiction and recovery act, a bipartisan piece of legislation to help fight the misuse of prescription drugs, in terms of prescription pain killers called opioids. now, look, it has been a huge problem in our country-- communities all around the country. senator ayotte from new hampshire and senator portman of ohio were two of the main sponsors of this legislation. i know [[page s2440]] senator portman was on the floor recently, talking about different legislation. but he has shown heroic leadership in an area that certainly needed to be addressed. the senate worked and reauthorized the older americans act. this was another bipartisan piece of legislation. it works to help provide senior citizens with things like meals, transportation--ways to help people live in their own homes longer and ways to help in terms of their quality of life, which is very important for americans all across the country. we passed legislation to overhaul and reauthorize the federal aviation administration. this is a significant accomplishment. this legislation promotes u.s. aerospace jobs by cutting through some of the redtape that has been hurting airplane designers. then, just last week, we passed a comprehensive overhaul of american energy policy, something we had not done in about 8 years. over the past few years, hard-working americans have made this country into an energy superpower. yet we had not passed any kind of major energy legislation for about 8 years because washington's regulations have simply not kept pace, and they have actually worked against the energy producers, people that are getting back to work, getting this country's economy returned. the legislation we passed is going to rein in some of this needless, wasteful bureaucracy that the federal government has imposed on the people creating energy jobs and working to produce more energy because energy is called a master resource for a reason. we have it in great abundance. one of the very important parts was language to expedite the shipment of america's natural gas to buyers around the world. it is good for our economy, and it is good for our allies who will be able to decrease their dependence on russian gas. senator lisa murkowski from alaska did an outstanding job of making sure that this legislation had ideas from both sides of the aisle. that is a big part of why this piece of major energy legislation--first time in 8 years--passed 85 to 12--85 to 12. that is another big accomplishment of the senate this year that does not get enough attention. it is not just that we are passing important legislation that helps americans, but we are doing it in a bipartisan way that allows every senator--every member of this body--to represent the people back home with their ideas and their suggestions. we have voted on 129 amendments so far this year--129 amendments voted on this year. when the democrats under harry reid were in control, a lot of people around here got used to the idea that people did not actually get to vote on amendments. in 2014, the last year under democratic control under harry reid, the senate had only 15 up- or-down votes on amendments all year--full calendar year 2014. when republicans took the majority, we changed that. the senate has been working this year just as we worked last year. we could have done a lot more if a few democrats had not blocked progress on some very important pieces of legislation. the people in wyoming now know that there are some important things they really care about, and they were actually blocked by president obama. in january, the president vetoed legislation that we had passed to improve health care in this country by repealing major parts of obamacare. remember, the president said to democrats that they should forcefully defend and be proud of that health care law, but one out of four americans--25 percent of americans--say they have been personally harmed by the president's health care law. so we put it on his desk to do a repeal, and he vetoed that. now, only about one in eight people in this country say they have been helped by the health care law. when you take a look at major legislation that impacts the country, it is no surprise that this health care law continues to be very unpopular, especially when you see that for every one person who says they have been helped, there are almost two people who said they have personally been hurt by the law. the president also vetoed legislation that we passed here to bring some sanity to something called the waters of the united states rule-- again, a rule put out in regulation by the president, a reinterpretation of the law. the law is very clear to me, but the president had his own approach. we put a bill on his desk to overturn what he has tried to do. the courts have actually stopped him in his tracks, but he once again vetoed our efforts. last year the president actually vetoed five different bills passed by congress. this kind of obstructionism from president obama doesn't help our country move forward. it is not helpful when the democratic leaders do everything they can to convince people that nothing is being done in the senate, but we hear that day after day from minority leader harry reid. it is interesting, because when senator reid was the majority leader, he had a very firm strategy, and the strategy seemed to be to do as little as possible. well, he is now the minority leader, and i think he went from the majority to the minority for a reason. it seems to me that he is still hanging on, clinging on to that losing strategy. the plan didn't work then, and i think that one of the reasons that he continues to try to talk down and slow down some of our progress is because, actually, he is envious--envious of anyone who gets things done in the senate. republicans in the senate are not interested in working at harry reid's pace and neither are the democrats--many of the democrats. most senators agree that we have a lot of work to do and that it is good for america when we actually do the work. that is why we have been working our way through the appropriations bills. this year we got the earliest start ever to appropriations bills--and really in the history of the modern budget process. so we continue to work on that. i wish to be clear on one important point. doing our job in the senate doesn't mean setting aside the priorities of the american people just to help president obama build a political legacy. that is why the senate is going to stand firm and strong to give americans a voice in who gets to fill the vacancy on the supreme court. now president obama wants us to set aside everything else and let him appoint his justice to the supreme court. it is not going to happen. we do our job every day, doing the things that will make an immediate difference to the families all across the country, things that republicans and democrats agree on and that everybody knows we should be doing. that is what you are seeing with this republican-run senate. that is what the people want us to do. that is what they expect us to do, and that is what we will continue to do. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from rhode island. mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 20 minutes. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. climate change mr. whitehouse. mr. president, today is the 135th time i have come to give voice to the issue that i feel will most significantly define this generation of leadership in the united states and, frankly, around the globe. i know that there are many people in washington who would prefer to ignore what our carbon emissions are doing to our oceans and to our climate, but we disregard nature's warnings at our peril. the changes to our environment, fueled by our carbon pollution, are far-reaching--from the coastlines to the prairies, from mountain tops to deep oceans, from pole to pole. as a terrestrial species, we naturally pay more attention to what is happening on land, such as increasing average global temperatures and upheavals in extreme weather. we don't so much see what is happening in our oceans. every year we emit into the earth's thin atmosphere tens of gigatons of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels--nearly 36 gigatons of carbon dioxide in 2014. not all of that carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere. our oceans--the earth's oceans--absorb approximately one- third of all our carbon pollution. that means they have absorbed roughly 600 gigatons in our industrial era. for the record, a gigaton is a billion tons--not a thousand tons, not a million tons, but a billion tons--and 600 [[page s2441]] billion tons of carbon dioxide have gone into our oceans. we know what that does. all that carbon dioxide in the oceans changes the ocean's very chemistry, and it makes ocean water more acidic. the chemical reaction, carbon dioxide reacting with water to form carbonic acid, is simple. you can replicate it in a middle school science lab, but its effects in the oceans are profound. according to research published in the journal nature geoscience, the rate of change in ocean acidity is already faster than at any time in the past 50 million years on earth. we are rapidly spiraling into unknown territory. by way of context, the human species has been around on earth for about 200,000 years. the human species started farming and herding, went from hunting and gathering to the basics of socialized human life less than 20,000 years ago. we are doing something to our planet now that has no precedent for 50 million years. this line shows the increasing co 2 in the atmosphere in parts per million. this line shows the absorption of the co 2 by the ocean, and this line shows the ph change in the oceans as a result. i would point out that ph is actually measured on a logarithmic scale. so if you were to adjust this to the standard percentage-type display of information, you would see this falling much more steeply. this is a very conservative way of showing what is happening to our oceans. the logarithmic scale is a multiple, not just a steady line. so as you move down the ph numbers, you are actually creating much more massive effects in the ocean. people have measured this drop in ocean ph from climate change. this is not a theory. you can go out and measure it with equipment that is not very different, again, from what a middle school with an aquarium would use to measure ph in the aquarium. people measure something else in our oceans also. they measure the rise in ocean temperature. for decades, the oceans have absorbed over 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gas emissions. the heat that comes in, that gets trapped in our thin atmosphere when the sun's warmth gets trapped by these greenhouse gasses, lands in a variety of places. the antarctic ice sheet gets two- tenths of a percent of the heat. the greenland ice sheet gets two- tenths of a percent of the heat. arctic sea ice gets eight-tenths of a percent of the heat. glaciers and icecaps take up nine-tenths of a percent of the heat. all of our continents together, the land mass of the earth, take up 2.1 percent of the added heat from climate change. the atmosphere, that thin membrane that allows us to live and breathe on this planet, has taken up 2.3 percent of the heat. all the rest of it, 93 percent, has been taken up by the oceans. they are our refrigerant. they are our cooler. they are the air conditioner for the planet. but when you take up that much, things begin to change, and ocean heat is ramping up. a study published in the journal nature climate change found that in the last 20 years--actually, less than 20, from 1997 to now, to be exact--the oceans absorbed the same amount of heat energy just in that 20-year period as they had in the previous 130 years. that is a dramatic increase in heat uptake by the oceans. it is our human activity, specifically our unfettered burning of fossil fuels, that has made our oceans both warmer overall and more acidic. one result of this is the calamity now taking place in the world's coral reefs. a healthy coral reef is one of the most productive and diverse ecosystems on earth. it is an engine for the propagation of life. coral depends on a symbiotic relationship with tiny, photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae. they live in the surface tissue of the coral. within a limited range of temperature, ph, salinity, and water clarity, this symbiosis can thrive, and it gives us reefs all over the world--these engines of life in the ocean. living coral has evolved for millions of years to maintain its symbiosis within that range. we are now measurably--not theoretically but measurably--altering the ocean in ways too fast for coral to adapt. push corals out of their comfort range for very long, and the corals get stressed and they evict their algae. this process is what is known as coral bleaching. because corals get most of their food out of that symbiotic relationship with these algae, if the algae can't be reabsorbed quickly, the corals die. coral bleaching sounds benign, but it is like cardiac arrest for a reef. there is a good chance it dies and, even if it doesn't, it is a long recovery. we are currently in the middle of a massive bleaching of the world's coral reefs--cardiac arrest at a global scale. dr. mark eakin of noaa's coral reef watch program says of this coral cataclysm: ``it very well may be the worst period of coral bleaching we have seen.'' and when he says ``we have seen,'' he means that which we have ever seen in the human record. worldwide, coral has already declined by approximately 40 percent. closer to home, across the caribbean and the florida keys, two key coral species have declined by an astonishing 98 percent in the last four decades. in my lifetime, i have seen once-radiant underwater ecosystems teeming with life become barren fields of white skeletons reaching into an empty ocean. one of my climate trips took me down to monroe county, fl, where i met mayor sylvia murphy, the republican mayor of monroe county, home to the famous florida keys. i asked her how the reefs were off the keys. ``beautiful,'' she said, ``unless you were here 15 years ago.'' australia's great barrier reef is the largest coral ecosystem on earth. it is one of the seven wonders of the natural world. severe bleaching is now hitting ``between 60 and 100 percent of corals'' on the great barrier reef, according to dr. terry hughes of james cook university in queensland, australia. professor hughes tweeted out a map of the current devastation, writing in the text: ``i showed the results of aerial survey of bleaching on the great barrier reef to my students, and then we wept.'' as with many other effects of climate change, it can be difficult to convey the magnitude of events when they aren't taking place in front of our terrestrial human faces. in his 2010 ted talk, one of the great marine scientists we have, leading coral ecologist dr. jeremy jackson, tried to bring this coral bleaching calamity a little closer to home. he put it like this: imagine you go camping in july somewhere in europe or north america, and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you, and you see that 80 percent of the trees, as far as you can see, have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked. and you come home, and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in north america and in europe have dropped their leaves. remember, this is his example from july. and then you read in the paper a few weeks later, ``oh, by the way, a quarter of those trees died.'' well, that's what happened in the indian ocean during the 1998 el nino, an area vastly greater than the size of north america and europe, when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died. jeremy came to speak to our caucus recently. he told us that every ocean ecosystem he studied in his career is gone, as he first found it, changed dramatically from his first visit. coral reefs are one of the first places that truly irreversible effects of climate change seem to be manifesting themselves--the proverbial canary dying in the coal mine of our carbon-ridden planet. to say the ocean we knew in our childhood is already gone is not doomsaying or pessimism, it is a grimly realistic assessment of where we stand, sadly. in the senate, there will likely be snickering about this. some will say: who gives a damn about coral reefs? if it can't be monetized by a corporation, the hell with it, is too often our motto here. well, god made these glories. god made them on our planet. in some cases, they have been growing for tens of thousands of years. we are wrecking them in a single generation, and if that doesn't mean something to us, a long look in the mirror might be in order. even those who can only see this tragedy through their monetizer goggles ought to know that a decline in healthy coral reefs is a huge blow to us all. according to an article last month in the atlantic, coral reefs are home to 25 percent of the world's fish biodiversity. reefs are incubators for ocean life, support systems for fisheries we depend on, tourist attractions for divers and snorkelers who fill local communities with their visiting and [[page s2442]] their spending, and they are coastal protection for coastal infrastructure and homes against storm waves. it is not nice to fool with mother nature. as pope francis warned, ``god always forgives; mankind sometimes forgives; nature never forgives. you slap her and she will slap you back.'' as he says, we are sinning with our actions against nature, and nature will not forget. we just don't have that right. we are making a mark on the earth in this generation that will not go away. if mankind lasts 10,000 years, well, 10,000 years from now they will see and know the mark of this generation on our planet, and they will justly inquire: how could we have been such fools? how could we, in this generation, have been such greedy, reckless, self-infatuated fools? in 1954, the united states detonated a hydrogen bomb over the bikini atoll in the marshall islands. the explosion vaporized everything on three islands, raised water temperatures to as much as 55,000 degrees, and left a crater over a mile wide and 240 feet deep. more than 60 years have gone by and scientists observe the corals in this part of the pacific flourishing again. if you give it a chance, life finds a way. dr. zoe richards, one of the scientists involved in the study, said: ``the healthy condition of the coral at bikini atoll today is proof of their resilience and ability to bounce back from massive disturbances, that is, if the reef is left undisturbed and there are healthy nearby reefs to source the recovery.'' so that is the caveat. reefs can recover but not if we continue to stack the deck oceanwide against them by pumping so much heat and carbon pollution into the oceans. senator schatz of hawaii--not coincidently another ocean state-- introduced, along with me, the american opportunity carbon fee act last year to address climate change with a market-based solution built on principles espoused by leading republican economists. we went to republicans--former cabinet officials, former members of congress, economists, think tanks--and we said: how should we do this? if you don't like the president's plan, if you don't like the regulatory way, what is your way? virtually every single person on the republican side who has thought this problem through to a solution has come to the same place, a revenue-neutral carbon fee with an appropriate border adjustment. so that is what we wrote. when you are ready, we are here. we did it your way. as a senator, john f. kennedy once said: let us not despair but act. let us not seek the republican answer or the democratic answer but the right answer. let us not seek to fix the blame for the past--let us accept our own responsibility for the future. this is particularly true for our oceans. as one florida mayor put it: ``the ocean is not republican, and it's not democratic . . . it's a nonpartisan ocean,'' and that nonpartisan ocean is screaming warnings at us that we ought to heed in nonpartisan fashion. we have a clear scientific understanding of the problem, and we have a moral obligation to act. time is not on our side. we need to pay attention to the evidence. we need to accept the reality of our predicament as it is communicated to us by the laws and signs of nature--god's signals to us on this earth. that is what healthy coral looks like under the water. here it is bleached out and dying. it is our ocean. it is our responsibility. i urge this body to wake up and lead. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. isakson. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. tribute to dr. emily lembeck mr. isakson. mr. president, i come to the floor of the senate to do something i periodically like to do when a citizen of my state deserves recognition for the contributions they have made to my state and the citizens of my state. today is such a day. dr. emily lembeck is the superintendent of the marietta city public school system. recently, she was inducted into the hall of fame for education, and her palm print is embedded in the walk around glover park square in marietta, ga. i am close to emily in more ways than one. when i chaired the state board of education in 1996, she was an elementary school principal at dunleith elementary in marietta, ga. she had been at west side, she moved on to marietta middle school, and later became superintendent of the marietta public schools--8,900 students, 1,200 employees--a challenge but a wonderful community. throughout her career, she has gifted more to children in our community than any person i know of. in particular, she has taught those who didn't know how to read to read. she has made reading a passion in our community. she has made children's ability to read and comprehend and understand and move forward in life a reality, in a place where at one time it was no reality at all. in fact, let me tell you, when i was chairman of the state board of education we were working hard to make reading first a movement in this country. she came forward with this idea about adopting something called marietta reads. it was a very simple program but a program where leaders in the community, such as i, would come to elementary schools in marietta, ga, sit down ``indian style'' on the floor with first graders and teach them to read, read with them, and help them identify with the joy of reading and the understanding of reading. from that day, i gained a greater appreciation for the challenge every teacher faces as they teach our children in classrooms. emily lembeck has been awarded almost every award you can possibly get, from the chamber of commerce to the kiwanis club, to the rotary. she has received the living the dream award from the naacp during king week a few years ago, she received the whitney m. young jr. service award from the boy scouts for her leadership. time and again, emily lembeck has been represented to be the great person she is--a leader in education, a leader of children, somebody our community is proud of. so on this day in washington, dc, on the floor of the senate, i want the name of emily lembeck to ring from one corner to the other for all she has contributed and all she has done to make our community a better, more wholesome, and more meaningful community, and for what she has done to make the lives of our community's children just a little bit better. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. thune. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. indian health service mr. thune. mr. president, for years now, patients on indian reservations in the great plains area have been receiving substandard medical care. the most recent example of the indian health service's failure occurred in december of 2015, when i was notified that two federally operated indian health service facilities in my state were at risk of losing their medicare provider agreements. in other words, these two facilities have been delivering such a poor level of care, the government isn't sure it is willing to continue paying these facilities to care for medicare patients. in february, at the request of several senators, myself included, the senate committee on indian affairs held a hearing to address the state of patient care at the indian health service in the great plains area. thanks to the graciousness of our colleague from wyoming, senator barrasso, who chairs the indian affairs committee, i was able to participate in this hearing and question several indian health service officials. i wish i could report that this hearing reassured me that the indian health service is on track to solve the problems facing patients on the reservations, but it just left me more concerned. the hearing underscored the government's massive failure on this issue: its failure to deliver quality care, its failure to ensure patient safety, and its failure to live up to treaty responsibilities. [[page s2443]] i have read the reports from the centers for medicare and medicaid services, and some of the stories really are beyond comprehension. incredibly, a report of dirty, unsanitized medical equipment left exposed in an emergency room isn't even the most shocking of those stories. one patient who had suffered a severe head injury was discharged from the hospital mere hours after checking in, only to be called back later the same day when his test results arrived. the patient's condition was so serious that he was immediately flown to another facility for care. one health service facility was in such disarray that a pregnant mother gave birth on a bathroom floor--a bathroom floor--without a single medical professional nearby, which shockingly wasn't the first time this had happened at this facility. i wish i were able to stand here today and report that conditions are getting better. unfortunately, i cannot. since february's hearing, we have been made aware of another tragic event that occurred at pine ridge hospital. reports from the centers for medicare and medicaid services indicate that a 23-year-old patient complaining of nausea and cramping in his hands and lower extremities died from cardiac arrest 2 hours after he was discharged from the emergency department. an investigation conducted by cms verified that this young man failed to receive an adequate medical screening evaluation before his discharge. even worse, the report indicated that there was no documentation showing nurse and doctor communication. it hasn't helped that congress's attempts to address these problems have been hampered by less-than-honest reporting from the indian health service. time and again, we have found that conditions on the ground have not matched up to information reported to congress. in 2014, i requested a status update from the then-acting director of the indian health service. in her response, she stated that ``the great plains area has shown marked improvement in all categories'' and that ``significant improvements in health care delivery and program accountability have also been demonstrated.'' significant improvements? sending a man home with bleeding in his brain and having a mother give birth prematurely on a bathroom floor are not signs of significant improvements. on december 4, 2015, officials from the indian health service stated that a majority of the concerns at rosebud hospital had been addressed or abated. yet, mere hours later, i was informed that the rosebud hospital emergency department was functioning so poorly that emergency patients would be diverted to other hospitals beginning the next day. it has now been 143 days, and the indian health service leadership has been unable to reopen the rosebud hospital's emergency department. for the last 143 days, incoming emergency patients have had to travel between 44 and 55 miles to receive care. that is similar to requiring a resident of harpers ferry, wv, to travel to washington, dc, to receive emergency services. and to date, the indian health service has been unable to tell us when it anticipates emergency department services will resume. the rosebud sioux tribe informs me that since this emergency department has been on diverted status, six individuals have lost their lives in ambulances while being transported to a hospital farther away. six families are now left to wonder whether their loved ones could have been saved if the indian health service had been doing its job. this is unconscionable. the indian health service has one last chance this friday to reach an agreement with cms to set the rosebud hospital back on a path to compliance with basic safety and administrative requirements. if the indian health service fails to do so, rosebud will lose its status as a medicare provider. additionally, the indian health service has until friday to address emergency medical treatment and active labor act violations found at pine ridge hospital. the administration has drafted report after report promising to correct these issues, yet time and again it has failed to follow through. during the recent indian affairs committee hearing, the former principal deputy director of the indian health service could not remember that he was in charge of implementing a 2011 report. where is the accountability? who is in charge? we have got to do better. simply shifting staff between positions and offices, as the indian health service has done in response to these problems, is not enough. it is time for action. we must do everything within our power--we will do everything within our power--to hold the indian health service accountable and to make sure this never happens again. i continue to work with my colleagues in the senate on a path forward to demand accountability from an agency that, by all accounts, is disconnected and unresponsive to the needs of our native americans. i will also continue to consult with the nine tribes in south dakota. our tribes are in the best position to help figure out the path forward for their own health care, and i believe the indian health service must do a better job of consulting with our tribes when it comes to the care they receive. i am going to do everything i can within my power to get all of our tribal citizens the quality care they deserve. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. burr. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (ms. ayotte). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. burr. madam president, i ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. (the remarks of mr. burr pertaining to the introduction of s. 2854 are printed in today's record under ``statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions.'') mr. burr. i thank the presiding officer, and i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from ohio. comprehensive addiction and recovery bill mr. portman. madam president, i rise today to speak on behalf of the one in three ohioans who knows somebody who is struggling with addiction to heroin or prescription drugs. i rise today on behalf of the over 5,000 americans who have lost their lives to a prescription drug overdose since the senate passed the comprehensive addiction and recovery act back on march 10. i rise today to talk about an epidemic which is affecting my home state of ohio, which is affecting all our states, whichever it is, and which is affecting our country and must be dealt with. this is the fourth time i have come to the floor of the senate since we passed cara, which is the comprehensive addiction and recovery act, and i come to floor to talk about our legislation and to ask the house of representatives to please pass that legislation, which would then go to the president for his signature and could begin to help in communities all across the country. the legislation i am talking about is legislation that the senator from new hampshire, now who is the chair right now, the presiding officer, has been involved with in a very deep way in her own state of new hampshire and also here on the senate floor. i appreciate all the hard work she has put into this, and i know she agrees with me that it is time for the house to act. we passed it on march 10. that means it has been 47 days since the senate acted. about 120 americans die every day of a drug overdose. it has been 47 days. that means we have lost 5,600 americans to drug overdoses since the senate passed this bill. by the way, it is not just about that tragic loss of life, it is about so many people who may not have overdosed but have this addiction and are not taking care of their families, are not able to work and be a productive citizen, are not achieving their god-given potential. it is about those who have overdosed but have been saved by this miracle drug that police and firefighters and other first responders and sometimes family members now are administering called narcan or naloxone. it means that since the senate passed this bill, this epidemic is getting worse, not better. that is based on [[page s2444]] all of the information i get back home. last week in lebanon, oh--it is a small town north of cincinnati, oh, where my family has roots going back to the 1920s--in lebanon, oh, a 34-year-old woman, who was engaged to be married, overdosed and died in front of her children, one aged 10 and one baby girl who was still learning to walk. by the way, that little girl's father has now been arrested. within days of her mother's addiction--she has now lost both her mom and her father. last week, from tuesday afternoon to wednesday morning--tuesday afternoon to wednesday morning--six people died of overdoses in one small town called elyria, oh. it is not a big city; there are about 53,000 people in elyria. we lost six people in 24 hours. that does not include the 14 people who were saved by this miracle drug i talked about, naloxone, that reverses the effects of an overdose. that is what has been happening. that is happening on our streets, and in the case of my home town of cincinnati, it is happening in our parking lots. at noontime on sunday, in my hometown, a man overdosed in the parking lot of the museum center in cincinnati, oh. first responders moved quickly and were able to save his life. but it is happening in broad daylight, unfortunately, more and more frequently. since 2007 drug overdoses have killed more people in ohio than car accidents, making it the no. 1 cause of accidental death. i am told that nationally, now, it is the leading cause of accidental death in the country. it is not car accidents, which we would might have assumed, it is overdoses. they have more than tripled in ohio from 1999 to 2010. we are told that 200,000 ohioans are addicted to opioids--200,000 people. that is the size of a major city like akron, oh. that is something which should concern us all. last week there was a poll that showed that 3 in 10 ohioans know someone who has abused prescription drugs, and 1 in 8 knows someone who has overdosed. we are talking about more than 1.3 million ohioans. according to nida--the national institute on drug abuse--the united states, even though we make up about 5 percent of the world's population, consumes 75 percent of the prescriptions drugs, including the vast majority of the world's prescription painkillers, the narcotic painkillers. they say four to five of the people who are heroin addicts started on prescription drugs. we have heard more about this this week in the news, about the fact that so many people get addicted to the opioid, which is the prescription drug. sometimes it is actually prescribed to them; sometimes they obtain it illegally. they turn to heroin as a less expensive alternative and then end up overdosing. the results are tragic. if this is not an epidemic, i don't know what is. it is affecting every area. it knows no zip code. so when you think about drugs and drug abuse and the effects of it, you might think inner city. that is not so. it is everywhere--in the suburbs, in the rural areas. it knows no zip code. i mentioned that this legislation we worked on here for a few years passed the senate. it was bicameral legislation, meaning it was the house and senate working together for 3 years. we had five conferences here in washington. we brought in experts on the issues of prevention and education and treatment and recovery and how to deal with our veterans who are coming back, who have a high rate of addiction, how to deal with women and their babies. in my home state of ohio, we have had a huge increase in the rate of babies being born addicted, and what do you do about that? we put together this legislation in a comprehensive manner to handle not just one part or one sector but to be something that would deal with the holistic approach so that we could actually get at this issue. in the house, by the way, the identical legislation was introduced, and they now have over 120 cosponsors of that legislation in the house. yet they have not been able to move on that legislation. instead, they are moving on other legislation to deal with the issue. that is good. i am sure there are a lot of other things that can and should be done. some of what they are doing is consistent with cara. but we know cara works. we know that if we can pass it, the president would sign it. we know it would help immediately in our communities. so i again call on the house to move quickly. last week a subcommittee in the house chaired by joe pitts marked up one dozen bills that have to do with how we fight this epidemic. joe pitts is a man who cares a lot about this issue. he has a passion for it. this week my friend and full committee chairman fred upton is going to mark up those 12 bills. the house has a lot of good ideas. that is fine. that is good. i joined congressman bill johnson of marietta, oh, who has been a passionate advocate on this issue, to introduce something called the preventing abuse of cough medicine act, which would restrict the sale of certain cough medicines that are frequently abused. that is good. it is a commonsense ohio idea. i thank my friend and colleague for doing his part to help our constituents. that should be passed in addition to cara, along with other legislation. i certainly respect my colleagues over there very much, as i said, but let's just give cara a vote, and then let's move on this other legislation as well. it takes a while, as all of us are painfully aware, to get something through the process around here. this one went through with a 94-to-1 vote. it is comprehensive. it was introduced in both the house and the senate. they have over 120 cosponsors. let's just move that. then, if there are other things to be dealt with, like the one i talked about, we can work on those as well and find ways to work together to find common ground. i will support that. i cannot speak for all of my colleagues, but i can speak for all of them--with the exception of one who voted the other way--to say that we will help get cara to the president. in fact, it doesn't need to come back to the senate if they pass the cara legislation. more and more members in the house are focused on this issue. that is good. tomorrow, the house judiciary committee is also marking up legislation in this area. so this is a separate committee--the energy and commerce committee--and now the judiciary committee. they are going to mark up five related bills, including what they consider the alternative to cara. it has some of the cara provisions but not all of them. let me tell you what the experts out there are saying. there are over 120 groups who have endorsed our legislation, helped us to get our legislation through. yesterday, the policy director of the harm reduction coalition sent a letter to the judiciary committee saying that its alternative ``omits vital provisions in cara addressing recovery, collateral consequences, prevention, and education. these omitted provisions represent critical community priorities, which truly relate to the comprehensiveness of cara's approach. cara was developed through a thorough process of extensive consultation with dozens of stakeholders . . . and has secured the broad support of national, state, and local addiction and recovery, public health, and criminal justice organizations. . . . the version of cara passed by the senate represents substantial consensus among both community stakeholders and bipartisan lawmakers.'' the house judiciary's alternative to cara does contain some of cara's best proposals. i appreciate that. but unfortunately it dropped out a number of really important ones as well. some of the most important ideas that are missing include provisions expanding drug takeback programs. again, we talked about this earlier. these prescription drugs are at the heart of this problem. these takeback programs get these prescription drugs off the bathroom shelf, allow us to pull these drugs away from our communities so that people are not using these drugs to get into more drugs, to get into heroin. that is not in there. there is also a heroin law enforcement task force that was dropped out and a drug court for veterans called the veterans court. that is a very important issue for all of us. the veterans' testimony we got made it clear to us that these courts are working. i have toured some of these courts. i have had a chance to sit down at a roundtable discussion in ohio with one of our [[page s2445]] great veterans courts to talk to veterans whose lives have been entirely turned around by these veterans courts. after years and years of bouncing around in the prison system or at the va, finally they get into these drugs courts for veterans, where they are surrounded by other veterans and they are able to pull their lives together, to get their families back together, and in one case go back to school. there is one guy who is about to graduate from ohio state university after years and years of not being able to find a way to move forward. here is another one. patty mccarthy metcalf of faces and voices of recovery wrote in a letter today that taking out the cara recovery provisions ``will prolong the crisis of addiction by not providing the critical support in communities across our nation where it is most needed. recovery services provided by recovery community organizations, including recovery coaching and emergency rooms and drug courts and recovery education and awareness, are desperately needed and highly effective in getting people with addiction on a long-term path to recovery.'' what does she mean by all that? she means that these recovery coaches and the services that are supported by the cara bill help people who might go, as she said, to an emergency room because they have an overdose to be confronted by somebody who says: look, we can help you get better. you don't have to do this again. you don't have to overdose again. you don't have to go through this near-death experience. we can get you into a program where you can get treatment and recovery. someone has to provide the resources for those coaches. we want those coaches. all of us as citizens should want them. we don't want people to keep overdosing again and again. we want to break that cycle. that is what our legislation would do. patty makes the critical point that our response has to be comprehensive. i think she is right. she says: prevention, treatment and enforcement cannot solve the opiate problem without recovery supports. national experts on addiction, and millions of people in recovery, will agree that a comprehensive approach is critical. that is what we do. cara is comprehensive. there are 71 recovery groups, including the ohio state university collegiate recovery community, which sent a letter to the house judiciary committee and the education and workforce committee today expressing concern that two sections of cara which expand recovery supports for students in high school and in college were dropped out. these are amazing programs. i am so impressed with these brave young men and women who stand up and say: i have a problem. i have an addition. for other students at this high school or at this college, who, like me, have this addiction, have this disease, i want to help you. we should work together and come together in support groups. there did not use to be any of these hardly, as far as i know. now there are a number of them. ohio state university is one of the places that took the lead in this. i am so proud of those students who stood up and said: despite the stigma around this, i am going to stand up and say that i have this problem, and i know many of you do too. if you do, come, and we can work together to work through this problem. again, what they say is, ``we support a comprehensive approach to addressing this epidemic, which must include providing recovery supports that enable individuals to enter and sustain their recovery.'' again, cara is comprehensive. no other bill comes close. as this process moves forward, i hope we will insist that any final agreement represents a comprehensive approach because this epidemic has to be combated from all angles. the approach we took to writing cara was to say we are going to take the best ideas regardless of where they come from. we don't care who brings them. we just care what the idea means to help address this problem. we had ideas from democrats. we had ideas from republicans. we had ideas from house members, from senators, from experts in law enforcement, and from patients in recovery. we didn't ask who had the idea, we asked if it was a good idea. that is how you cobble together good legislation that makes a difference in our communities. on friday i was in ohio chairing a hearing of the homeland security and governmental affairs committee. it was at university hospitals of cleveland, oh. we heard from law enforcement experts such as the attorney general, mike dewine, and the acting u.s. attorney, carole rendon. she was great, as was senator dewine. law enforcement, including the fraternal order of police, has been strongly supportive of cara because they believe this comprehensive approach works. we also provide training for the administering of this naloxone we talked about, the narcan, and being sure that law enforcement has what they need to be able to help combat this issue. we also create these law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and methamphetamines. they want better tools, law enforcement does, so they can save lives. we owe them that. in ohio i am that our first responders have used naloxone more than 16,000 times in the last year alone. thank god for those first responders because they have saved thousands and thousands of lives. on friday we also heard from tracy plouck from the ohio department of mental health and addiction services. we heard from dr. nancy young of children and family futures and dr. margaret kotz, who is the director of addiction recovery services at university hospitals in cleveland, one of the experts we have relied on. they talked about the recovery process. their point was that probably 9 out of 10 people who need treatment are not getting it. that is a clear sign the status quo is not working. some of it is the stigma we talked about earlier, people are not coming forward. some of it is not having treatment programs that are accessible. we heard about waiting lists, sometimes 3 or 4 days, sometimes 14 days, sometimes a couple of months--and people being at that point in their lives where they are willing to come forward and say: i need to solve this problem. yet there is a waiting list. last night i had a tele-townhall meeting. we had 25,000 ohioans on at any one time. it was a big group. people were talking about all kinds of issues, from the terrorist threat we face to energy and environment issues, to the jobs issue. one guy called in and he asked: what are you doing about treatment for people who have drug problems? so i told him about the cara legislation and he seemed to have a quiver in his voice. i asked him: you seem to have a lot of interest in this and some information about it. can you tell us your background? i thought perhaps he was a doctor or a treatment specialist. unfortunately, he said what you hear more and more from parents, which is: i lost my child to addiction. she had an overdose. she died. and the reason i am so focused on treatment, senator portman, is because we got her to the place in her life where she was willing to go, finally, to a treatment center and get the treatment and recovery services she needed to deal with this disease that had gripped her--and there was no room at the inn. there was a waiting list. we couldn't get her in, and it was during that period that we couldn't get her into the treatment center that would have helped her that she overdosed. this is a caller from last night who--on a call--was willing to say this in front of 25,000 people. i told him i appreciated the fact that he had the courage to call in and the courage to talk about it. of course, i expressed my sympathy to him and his family but asked him to continue talking about it, to channel that grief into something positive. until we get more people into treatment, this is going to continue to be a huge problem in every one of our communities. until we change the law, until we get legislation passed in washington so we can be better partners, we are not going to be doing our part. will washington solve this problem? no. this problem is going to be solved in our communities, it is going to be solved in our families, and it is going to be solved in our hearts. we have to get people to pull away from this, to understand the dangers, better prevention and education. in our legislation, we have a prevention program to build awareness about the connection with prescription drugs and heroin. i bet most people listening [[page s2446]] right now didn't know about that connection, a lot of people don't. why would you, if you hadn't faced this issue? that awareness alone is going to make people make better decisions for themselves, for their children. friday in cleveland we had a man testify whose son died of an overdose. do you know why? because he had his molars--his wisdom teeth--taken out. when he had his wisdom teeth taken out, what happened? you know where i am going. they gave his son, a kid, percocet--a narcotic, a painkiller. the rest of the story you know, which is he started taking more of those and more of those. then he took some from the bathroom shelf of one of his relatives. he developed this addiction and eventually turned to heroin and overdosed. now his father, god bless him, is out there talking to high schoolers, talking to middle schoolers, talking to young people about the dangers. we can address this issue. we know we can. there has been success with other awareness programs. think of smoking and teen smoking. we have made great progress there. we have to make progress on this one. this is about life and death. we heard testimony on friday from dr. michele walsh, the director of neonatology at university hospitals. she talked about how she is increasingly seeing babies who are born with what is called neonatal abstinence syndrome. that is a fancy way of saying these poor babies are born with an addiction. she said the symptoms are the same you would see with an adult. it is the fidgeting. it is the sweats. these are little babies. i have gone to these neonatal units, and i know some of my colleagues have. you see these babies. they are so small they can fit in the palm of your hand, and they are addicted. you have these doctors and nurses with incredible passion, such as dr. michele walsh, who are taking care of them. in my home state of ohio we have had a 750-percent increase in the last 12 years with babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome--a 750-percent increase. every single neonatal unit in ohio is facing this. i have been to rainbow babies & children's in cleveland, which is at this hospital. i have seen what they do. i have been to st. rita's special care nursery in lima, oh. i have been to children's hospital in my own hometown. they are doing great work, but wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to deal with this issue because we had better prevention and education to let mothers know what the danger is when they are pregnant and they could have better treatment and recovery to get those women out of this grip of addiction so their babies can be born without these issues. frankly, the long-term effects we talked about at our hearing, talking to experts and doctors, i don't think people know what the long-term effects are--and of course that is scary. they basically take these babies through withdrawal. we have to provide babies with the medication at a lower level--but that you would provide an adult--to take them through the withdrawal process. cara, the legislation we are talking about, would help these women. it would help these babies by expanding treatment for expectant and postpartum women as well as awarding grants to evidence-based treatment services and residential treatment programs for pregnant women who are struggling with addiction. it would create a pilot program to provide family-based services to women who are addicted to opiates in a nonresidential outpatient setting. it is what we learn from experts-- how to help address this problem--that is in this legislation. i know there are other ideas out there, and that is great, but stripping out some of cara's core provisions just didn't make any sense to me. let's keep it comprehensive. let's be sure and get this legislation done and then work on additional legislation. the house could simply put cara on the suspension calendar and have a vote on it. that is the calendar where you have to have a two-thirds vote, but something like this with all the cosponsors and all the interest in this issues now, i think it would pass. that means we are one vote away of getting this help to our communities. that is how close we are to a historic achievement to help begin to turn the tide, to make the federal government a better partner with our states, our local communities. our great nonprofits are out there in the trenches doing the work and our families. there is no reason it couldn't happen today, tomorrow, or the next day before we go into another congressional recess. after 3 years of work, it doesn't make sense to start from scratch and try to rewrite this. let's work together to come up with additional ideas that are course appropriate. nobody has a monopoly on good ideas around here. believe me, i know some of these house members. they have the right intentions. they are trying to help. i appreciate that, but i also think we all need to appreciate the fact that this is a crisis. we are losing more and more americans, 5,600 since cara was passed in the senate. roughly every 12 minutes we lose someone else. people's lives are on the line. communities are being impacted. families are being torn apart. it is time for us to act and act quickly. i appreciate the time today. i urge the house to move quickly on this legislation so we can begin to help our communities in need. i yield back the remainder of my time. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. rubio. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ``el faro'' tragedy mr. rubio. madam president, i come to the floor today to discuss, first of all, the successful location of the el faro voyage data recorder by the ntsb. as you all recall, that was the ship that had sailed from jacksonville and was lost at sea and everyone perished. today, the ntsb found the data recorder. the u.s. coast guard, the u.s. navy, and other search partners were also involved. that gives me hope that we will soon have more answers about this terrible disaster and how to prevent a similar one from happening again. so i want to thank the men and women of the investigative team who worked together to find this important piece of the el faro puzzle. today we are also reminded of those who were lost on the el faro and the loved ones they left behind. they remain in our thoughts and prayers. zika virus madam president, on a different topic, i wanted to come to the floor today and talk again about the zika virus. once again there was an announcement that there had been additional cases identified in florida. just to recap where we stand now, zika has now spread to over 43 countries. there are 500 cases in u.s. territories, most of them on the island of puerto rico. in my home state of florida, there are now 93 cases--the most of any state--and the peak mosquito season is directly ahead. a lot has happened regarding zika. we have learned more and more about this disease. for example, we are now learning the virus has a direct link to guillain-barre syndrome, a very debilitating, often fatal, illness, and it is striking people affected with it. we are learning through recent science that it is not just the first trimester of pregnancy but also potentially in the second trimester that unborn children can be impacted by this, and the impacts are devastating. we are learning that of the two species of mosquitoes that spread the disease, one of them has developed an immunity, a resistance to the most commonly used pesticide to remove them. so there is real concern as we head into the summer months and mosquitoes begin to appear that soon we will wake up to the news that there has now been a mosquito- borne transmission within the continental united states. here is the bottom line: we don't know everything about this disease. we already know it is bad, but we don't know how bad it is. every day we find out more things. we know during these summer months it will be increasingly warm in many parts of the country where the two mosquito species that spread the virus can be found--in 30 out [[page s2447]] of 50 states. we know those mosquitoes tend to grow even faster during warm seasons and when there is a lot of water on the ground. and we know one of the countries most impacted by it--brazil--will soon host the summer olympic games, which means there is going to be a tremendous amount of travel to and from brazil, and, in fact, there already is. we know the disease is not just spread through mosquitoes, but it is also sexually transmitted. the result of all this is that there is a real concern about what direction we are headed. the president has asked for $1.9 billion in funding, and i am generally supportive of that request. i believe we need to deal with these issues on the front end as quickly as possible. we don't want to wake up one morning to the realization that we are now in the middle of summer, this has become an epidemic or a catastrophe, and we didn't do anything on the front end. everyone here will have to explain what their position was at the time. i also think you can be for zika funding--you can even be for zika funding at $1.9 billion--and you can also ask questions about how this money is going to be spent and, if possible, how we are going to pay for it because we are facing a debt situation in this country. i believe we can find $1.9 billion to pay for it. i have suggested some of my own. what we don't want to do is to play political games with this. i think it is important. on the one side, you can't just say: look, i am against anything they are asking for that comes up unless you prove otherwise. i think it is important that we now admit this is a serious issue that needs to be confronted. but it is also not being an obstructionist to ask: how is the money going to be spent? what programs will be funded? where is the prioritization going to be? i think it is not too much to ask to have a level of detail about that $1.9 billion. what i am concerned about is some of the reports in the news that there are games being played with this. we have heard the news that the administration has redirected $44 million in emergency preparedness grants promised to state and local governments this summer. oftentimes in politics this is a very typical maneuver. what you do is, you cut money from an organization somewhere and you blame it on congressional inaction--or in the states, on legislative inaction. and they say the reason you are losing this money is that someone is not doing what we want, so you find the most painful, alarming cuts and use them as a leverage point to get pressure built on congress. so i want to make sure that this is not part of some game. we shouldn't be playing games with this. i think it is also important to understand why, in addition to the $1.9 billion, they are also saying on top of that we also have to repay the $510 million in ebola funds since the ebola situation is now under control. these are all legitimate issues that need to be confronted. but in the end, we have to do something about this. i know the senate and the congress were not meant to move at warp speed, to say the least. it is a place in which action takes time, and i understand that. but there are things we don't have time for. this issue has to be dealt with on the front end. summer is here already. if you have been in south florida, as i have on weekends, and back in my home state, as i will be again this friday and into the weekend, it is already hot. that heat, combined with a wet season, means mosquitoes. this is mosquito season. we have a disease that is already creating this catastrophic impact in countries neighboring us to the south. we know it is spread by mosquitoes. mosquito season is rapidly approaching, and we have to get ahead of this. none of us wants to be in a position in june, july, and august where this thing breaks out and we start seeing cases in the continental united states, as we are already seeing in puerto rico and in brazil, and we have no answer for why we did nothing during these months we were here. i don't know what all the impediments are. i know there are conversations going on at the committee level, but i hope we can bridge this rather quickly. there are so many other issues we can argue about. there are so many other issues we can have debates about in the partisan season. but i don't think a disease of this magnitude, with this level of risk, is one we should be playing games with. my hope is that cooler heads will prevail and that over the next few days we will find it within ourselves to find out how to appropriate the necessary money so we can begin to deal with this, at least on the front end. maybe there is a chunk of money on the front end so we can begin to address it and then we can come back later and fund the rest of it. i think it is incumbent upon the administration and others to say ``this is what the money is going to be spent on'' so we can judge whether the money and the funds are actually going to things that work. but this needs to happen. this problem can't wait, and it shouldn't be a partisan fight. combating zika is an appropriate use of public dollars. it is an appropriate use of public dollars. i am for limited government. i am for a very limited federal government. but one of the things the federal government is tasked with is keeping our people and country safe, particularly from external threats. traditionally, what that means is an invading army or some military threat from abroad or whatever. in this case, this is a threat emerging from abroad, but it is coming toward the united states. there is nothing that prevents the united states from becoming like some of these other countries that have been impacted by this--nothing. our people are not genetically immune to zika. it is a matter of time. it is not a question of if, it is a question of when there will be a mosquito-borne transmission of the zika disease here in the united states. and when that happens, if the posture of the congress has been that we did nothing--nothing has happened on this; we are still debating over $200 million or $50 million--people will not be satisfied with that answer. so my hope is that this is dealt with according to the level of urgency it deserves. as i said, in my home state of florida we already have 93 cases, with 2 new ones over the weekend. those numbers are only going to grow. it is just a matter of time before there is a mosquito- borne transmission somewhere in the united states--the continental united states, because, as i said, this has already occurred in puerto rico--and i hope we get ahead of it before it is too late. as i speak to the appropriators and those involved in this, my hope is that we can find our way forward on this rather quickly. there are so many other issues to argue about; this should not be one of them. the money needs to be spent the right way, but it needs to be spent and it needs to be appropriated, and we should endeavor to pay for as much of it, if not all of it, as we can. it needs to get quickly to the target. we need to move from this process and on to those programs so we can get ahead of it in may and june, before we get into the summer, before we get into mosquito season, and before we have an outbreak in the united states. if not, we then will have to answer to the people as to why nothing happened when we knew the risk was growing and the threat was emerging. with that, madam president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. flake. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. gardner). without objection, it is so ordered. unanimous consent request--executive calendar mr. flake. mr. president, it has been nearly 9 months since the united states had an ambassador to mexico. the president's nominee to that post, roberta jacobson, is eminently qualified for the post. the arizona republic noted in an editorial from march that ``she's qualified, respected and needed to do an important job.'' they are right. for more than 20 years, ms. jacobson has been immersed in the regional, political, economic, and security issues related to the western hemisphere. in fact, as part of her extensive background, she served for a time as director of the office of mexican affairs at the state department. she is obviously [[page s2448]] fluent in spanish and has earned the respect of her colleagues. she served for 3 years as deputy assistant secretary for canada, mexico, and nafta issues within the bureau of western hemisphere--experience that would later serve the united states well given that mexico is america's third largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totaling more than half a trillion dollars. however, she has been waiting for the senate to confirm her nomination since the senate foreign relations committee reported it to the senate in november of last year by a vote of 12 to 7. it should be incomprehensible to anyone around the country to have a post of the top diplomat to one of our most important bilateral relations open for this long, but for arizonans, it is particularly baffling. arizona alone enjoyed a trade relationship with mexico of nearly $17 billion last year. on the export side, arizona exports about $9 billion in goods and services to mexico every year, which, according to the arizona republic, ``accounts for 41 percent of the state's exports, and four times more than our state exports to our next biggest trading partner, canada.'' according to the arizona-mexico commission: with an economy that now surpasses $1.3 trillion, mexico ranks as one of the top 20 economies in the world. mexico's economy has been increasingly focused on manufacturing, particularly since the signing of the north american free trade agreement (nafta) in 1994. more than $1 billion in goods are exchanged between the united states and mexico every day. but the u.s.-mexico relationship is about more than just our economies; transportation issues, security threats, and natural resource management are just some of the fronts on which we cooperate with mexico. the arizona republic notes that ``the arizona department of transportation recently signed a memorandum of understanding to study ways to improve the trade corridor that spans the border.'' arizona alone shares six ports of entry with mexico, and phoenix's sky harbor airport facilitates 122 flights a week to and from mexico. all of this cooperation requires a close partnership between our two countries. the longer the united states goes without having an ambassador to mexico, the greater that partnership will suffer. to my knowledge, the holdup in this process is not based on any concrete concerns with the qualifications of this specific nominee. she enjoys overwhelming support. there is no reason not to move forward with this nomination. if there is opposition, then members should have the opportunity to express it. as such, i will be asking unanimous consent for a time agreement with a rollcall vote on her confirmation. there is simply no reason we should not have an ambassador to mexico when we have a candidate as qualified as roberta jacobson. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the democratic leader, the senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: calendar no. 365; that there be 30 minutes for debate only on the nomination equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the president be immediately notified of the senate's action, and the senate then resume legislative session without any intervening action or debate. the presiding officer. is there objection? the senator from florida. mr. rubio. mr. president, i agree that the u.s.-mexico relationship is one of our most important bilateral relationships. we do need an ambassador in mexico city who has a track record of effectively advancing u.s. interests. i do, however, have serious questions about the policies that assistant secretary jacobson has pursued during her tenure in the western hemisphere bureau. i have had conversations with the administration and others, such as senator corker, about the concerns, and i remain hopeful that we can find a way to resolve this issue in the very near future, but until then, i object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. the senator from arizona. mr. flake. mr. president, i plan to return frequently for as long as it takes to shed a light on this nomination and to make sure it moves forward, so i expect to be here tomorrow to do the same. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from iowa. world intellectual property day mr. grassley. mr. president, the united states is one of the most dynamic and innovative countries in the world. our nation's success in areas such as agriculture, manufacturing, computer technology, and medicine can be traced in large measure to our respect for, and protection of, intellectual property. every year on this day, april 26, we have the opportunity to recognize the important role of intellectual property rights in the fabric of our society when we celebrate world intellectual property day. nearly 230 years ago, our founding fathers recognized the importance of intellectual property and made provisions for its promotion and protection in the constitution. article i, section 8, clause 8 empowers congress ``to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing, for limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'' since that time--and stemming from these values--intellectual property has played a vital role in our economy, supporting jobs and advancing creative and scientific industries. in our modern, innovation economy, patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other forms of ip are more critical than ever. as the global intellectual property center recently pointed out in their broad survey of intellectual property in america, ip-intensive industries employ over 40 million americans, accounting for 38 percent of total u.s. gross domestic product. workers in ip-intensive industries are paid better than the national average, earning an average salary of over $50,000 compared to those in non-ip-intensive sectors where the average is roughly $39,000. in fact, intellectual property is so important to the american economy that the collective worth of all of the intellectual property in the united states is now above $5.8 trillion. in iowa, we have seen how intellectual property has become an integral part of our economy. our system of strong intellectual property protection has led to $11.2 billion in annual ip-related exports from the state, a total of 667,557 ip-related jobs, and 19.9 percent higher wages for direct ip workers than non-ip workers. just as iowans utilized strong ip laws 75 years ago when they were discovering how to feed the world through cutting-edge science, today's iowans benefit from our system of ip protection as they start companies and create new tech success stories. the judiciary committee plays an important role in protecting intellectual property. the committee exercises jurisdiction over our nation's intellectual property laws including those governing patents, trademarks, and copyrights. we consider legislation that helps to ensure that intellectual property rights continue to promote jobs and innovation. the committee also exercises important oversight of the patent and trademark office, icann, the office of the intellectual property enforcement coordinator, and various law enforcement entities charged with protecting ip. some recent examples of important legislation that helps promote intellectual property rights are the patent act of 2015 and the defend trade secrets act of 2016. the patent act, which passed the committee by a vote of 16 to 4 last june, takes important steps to stop abusive patent litigation practices. as bad actors are exploiting the high costs of litigation and using deceptive tactics to prey on businesses, it is important that this legislation be considered in the senate. just 3 weeks ago, the senate unanimously passed the defend trade secrets act of 2016, sponsored by senators hatch and coons. building upon the bipartisan consensus generated in the judiciary committee, the bill passed on the senate floor by a vote of 87 to 0. it is estimated that the american economy loses 2.1 million jobs and over [[page s2449]] $300 billion in economic losses every year because of trade secret theft. the defend trade secrets act brings much-needed uniformity to trade secret litigation. this will allow the creators and owners of trade secrets to more effectively address the growing problem of trade secret theft. the house of representatives is expected to pass our bill this week and i hope it will be immediately signed by the president. tomorrow, the judiciary committee will hold a hearing on counterfeits and their impact on consumer health and safety. we will hear from a panel of experts, including witnesses from the patent and trademark office, u.s. immigration and customs enforcement, and industry. these businesses include companies that provide home health care products and equipment to our troops. they will discuss how counterfeits can harm consumers and what their impact is on the economy. we will hear how law enforcement is addressing this problem as well as how stakeholders are educating consumers to protect themselves from counterfeits. the focus of this year's world intellectual property day is ``digital creativity.'' as the world intellectual property organization notes, the current era of internet connectivity is transforming how consumable culture such as films, tv, music, books, art, and other cultural works are created and distributed. this has led to radical changes in the way we access content and in how businesses operate. as challenges emerge as to how we protect intellectual property rights in these new economic models, we must continue to search for effective solutions that promote creativity across different mediums. so on this world intellectual property day, it is important to once again recognize the significance of our nation's robust system of intellectual property protection and enforcement. this system has helped create the united states' enduring role as a leader in innovation and creativity. as the chairman of the senate judiciary committee, i will continue to embrace my role as a promoter of intellectual property rights and american jobs. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",127883

CREC-2016-04-26-pt1-PgS2449-3,CREC-2016-04-26,114,TRIBUTE TO BART ELLEFRITZ,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2449-S2450] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO BART ELLEFRITZ Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am not sure of the man's name, but I want to thank a public policy professor at Western Illinois University. About a decade ago, this astute professor was talking with one of his best graduate students about his future. The professor knew that the young man was hoping to put his talent and training to good use working as a city planner or city manager in a small Illinois town--maybe a town like the one in which the young man had grown up. The professor suggested another possibility. He asked his student: ``Have you ever considered going to Washington and working on Capitol Hill? I think you might like it, and you'd be good at it.'' Fortunately for me and for countless others in my State of Illinois, that young man Bart Ellefritz, loves new challenges and adventures, so he decided to trust his professor's advice. He moved to Washington and landed a job as an intern in Senator Harry Reid's personal office. That is when my office first became aware of him. Before long, I hired Bart to work as a staff assistant on my Judiciary Committee staff. Bart mastered that job in no time flat and was ready for his next challenge, so he moved home to Illinois to work in my Springfield office doing casework. For those who may be unfamiliar with that term, ``casework'' is a word we use to describe efforts by our staff members who work to help people with specific problems--to try to cut through red tape and make government work better for people. Bart Ellefritz is a master of casework because he is smart and he believes that government can be a force for good. Most of all, he cares about people. In 2009, Bart got an offer that was too good to turn down. It was the beginning of President Obama's first term. Former Illinois Congressman Ray LaHood was the new U.S. Secretary of Transportation, and he asked Bart to come work for him, so he left--with my blessing. About 5 years ago, I succeeded in hiring Bart back to be the director of my Springfield office, which serves all of downstate Illinois. Let me tell you, being my downstate director is no 9-to-5 job for Bart Ellefritz. Somedays, it is a 5-to-9 job--from 5 in the morning until 9 at night. Bart is my representative--my eyes and ears--for a large part of my State. He drives hundreds of miles every week in his Mitsubishi Outlander Sport--made in Normal, IL--to meet with people on my behalf, listen to their ideas and concerns, and try to help them solve their problems. I can't begin to count the number of people whom Bart has helped, but let me tell you about one of them. Judy--I won't use her last name--works as a housekeeper at a motel where I often stay, and we have become friends. Several years ago, Judy confided to me that she was 62 years old and had never in her whole life had health insurance--not for a single day. She had worked her whole life in manual labor, working as a cook, a waitress, a housekeeper, and she had never known the security of having health insurance. I asked Bart to see if there was some way to help Judy. Bart spend hours and hours talking on the phone with Judy, driving to see Judy in person, talking with folks at Medicare and Medicaid. A final hurdle came when Judy needed an email account to sign up for health care. Judy had never used email before, so Bart helped her set up her account. Finally, at the age of 62, because of Bart's persistence and the Affordable [[Page S2450]] Care Act, Judy was able to afford health insurance. She was able to sleep more easily knowing that she was no longer just one bad illness or accident away from total financial ruin. I am sorry to report that Bart Ellefritz is leaving my office again next month. He is off on another great challenge. He will be working for CTA, the Chicago Transit Authority, one of the largest transit systems in the world, in one of the greatest cities in the world. I want to thank Bart publicly for the countless ways in which he has helped me and, more importantly, helped the people of Illinois. I also want to thank Bart's wife, Ashley, and their son, Charley, who is just 21 months old, for sharing Bart with the people of Illinois. Bart and Ashley are what some folks in Washington refer to as a mixed marriage. Ashley Messick was working as assistant secretary of the Senate Republican caucus, helping Senator McConnell run the Senate floor, when she and Bart met. Bart was sharing a house in Washington with some other young professionals--one of whom happened to be a close friend of Ashley's. They met at the house, and hit it off immediately. I also want to thank Bart's parents, Keith and Terri Ellefritz, for raising two wonderful sons. Their other son, Bart's brother Ben, is a minister. Keith and Terri raised their two boys in west central Illinois, in a town called Carthage, population 2,605. Bart played on his high school football team, the Carthage Blueboys, in 1998, the year they won the State football championship. Keith and Terri Ellefritz raised their boys to have big hearts and small-town values. Somewhere along the way, Bart also developed a passion for traveling, meeting new people, and seeing the world through their eyes. He has visited all seven Wonders of the World. He took 3 months off after he left the Department of Transportation to hike through sub-Saharan Africa. He ended that trip in Tanzania, where Ashley met up with him and together, they climbed more than 19,000 feet to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro. Bart once took his mom skydiving in Australia. This past October he spent 2 weeks hiking in Ethiopia. When Charley was born 21 months ago, his parents got him a passport, along with his birth certificate. At 7 months old, Charley got his passport stamped for the first time--for a trip to Colombia, South America. Bart Ellefritz pours his whole heart into whatever he does, whether he is riding a camel in the desert, spending time with Ashley and Charley, or listening to people of my State and helping to solve problems. And he is almost always smiling. In closing, I want to thank Bart again for the great skill, caring, and tenacity he has always brought to his job as a member of my staff, and I want to wish him the best of luck as he begins his next professional adventure with CTA in Chicago. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2449-S2450] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO BART ELLEFRITZ Mr. DURBIN.

Judy--I won't use her last name--works as a housekeeper at a motel where I often stay, and we have become friends. Several years ago, Judy confided to me that she was 62 years old and had never in her whole life had health insurance--not for a single day. She had worked her whole life in manual labor, working as a cook, a waitress, a housekeeper, and she had never known the security of having health insurance. I asked Bart to see if there was some way to help Judy. Bart spend hours and hours talking on the phone with Judy, driving to see Judy in person, talking with folks at Medicare and Medicaid. A final hurdle came when Judy needed an email account to sign up for health care. Judy had never used email before, so Bart helped her set up her account. Finally, at the age of 62, because of Bart's persistence and the Affordable [[Page S2450]] Care Act, Judy was able to afford health insurance. She was able to sleep more easily knowing that she was no longer just one bad illness or accident away from total financial ruin. I am sorry to report that Bart Ellefritz is leaving my office again next month. He is off on another great challenge. He will be working for CTA, the Chicago Transit Authority, one of the largest transit systems in the world, in one of the greatest cities in the world. I want to thank Bart publicly for the countless ways in which he has helped me and, more importantly, helped the people of Illinois. I also want to thank Bart's wife, Ashley, and their son, Charley, who is just 21 months old, for sharing Bart with the people of Illinois. Bart and Ashley are what some folks in Washington refer to as a mixed marriage. Ashley Messick was working as assistant secretary of the Senate Republican caucus, helping Senator McConnell run the Senate floor, when she and Bart met. Bart was sharing a house in Washington with some other young professionals--one of whom happened to be a close friend of Ashley's. They met at the house, and hit it off immediately. I also want to thank Bart's parents, Keith and Terri Ellefritz, for raising two wonderful sons. Their other son, Bart's brother Ben, is a minister. Keith and Terri raised their two boys in west central Illinois, in a town called Carthage, population 2,605. Bart played on his high school football team, the Carthage Blueboys, in 1998, the year they won the State football championship. Keith and Terri Ellefritz raised their boys to have big hearts and small-town values. Somewhere along the way, Bart also developed a passion for traveling, meeting new people, and seeing the world through their eyes. He has visited all seven Wonders of the World. He took 3 months off after he left the Department of Transportation to hike through sub-Saharan Africa. He ended that trip in Tanzania, where Ashley met up with him and together, they climbed more than 19,000 feet to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro. Bart once took his mom skydiving in Australia. This past October he spent 2 weeks hiking in Ethiopia. When Charley was born 21 months ago, his parents got him a passport, along with his birth certificate. At 7 months old, Charley got his passport stamped for the first time--for a trip to Colombia, South America. Bart Ellefritz pours his whole heart into whatever he does, whether he is riding a camel in the desert, spending time with Ashley and Charley, or listening to people of my State and helping to solve problems. And he is almost always smiling. In closing, I want to thank Bart again for the great skill, caring, and tenacity he has always brought to his job as a member of my staff, and I want to wish him the best of luck as he begins his next professional adventure with CTA in Chicago. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2449-S2450] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO BART ELLEFRITZ Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am not sure of the man's name, but I want to thank a public policy professor at Western Illinois University. About a decade ago, this astute professor was talking with one of his best graduate students about his future. The professor knew that the young man was hoping to put his talent and training to good use working as a city planner or city manager in a small Illinois town--maybe a town like the one in which the young man had grown up. The professor suggested another possibility. He asked his student: ``Have you ever considered going to Washington and working on Capitol Hill? I think you might like it, and you'd be good at it.'' Fortunately for me and for countless others in my State of Illinois, that young man Bart Ellefritz, loves new challenges and adventures, so he decided to trust his professor's advice. He moved to Washington and landed a job as an intern in Senator Harry Reid's personal office. That is when my office first became aware of him. Before long, I hired Bart to work as a staff assistant on my Judiciary Committee staff. Bart mastered that job in no time flat and was ready for his next challenge, so he moved home to Illinois to work in my Springfield office doing casework. For those who may be unfamiliar with that term, ``casework'' is a word we use to describe efforts by our staff members who work to help people with specific problems--to try to cut through red tape and make government work better for people. Bart Ellefritz is a master of casework because he is smart and he believes that government can be a force for good. Most of all, he cares about people. In 2009, Bart got an offer that was too good to turn down. It was the beginning of President Obama's first term. Former Illinois Congressman Ray LaHood was the new U.S. Secretary of Transportation, and he asked Bart to come work for him, so he left--with my blessing. About 5 years ago, I succeeded in hiring Bart back to be the director of my Springfield office, which serves all of downstate Illinois. Let me tell you, being my downstate director is no 9-to-5 job for Bart Ellefritz. Somedays, it is a 5-to-9 job--from 5 in the morning until 9 at night. Bart is my representative--my eyes and ears--for a large part of my State. He drives hundreds of miles every week in his Mitsubishi Outlander Sport--made in Normal, IL--to meet with people on my behalf, listen to their ideas and concerns, and try to help them solve their problems.

CREC-2016-04-26-pt1-PgS2450,CREC-2016-04-26,114,TRIBUTE TO PAUL DETTMAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2450] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO PAUL DETTMAN Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, after decades of committed service to the important cause of providing public housing for those in need, Paul Dettman is retiring this month as executive director of the Burlington Housing Authority. Throughout Paul's career, he has worked tirelessly in the field of public service. Public housing has not been a fashionable cause for many years, and our communities have certainly seen the effects of this sometimes forgotten priority. Paul Dettman was never deterred by these attitudes, however, and has been dedicated to finding creative solutions to provide for our most vulnerable friends and neighbors. Paul's leadership has resulted in a series of public-private partnerships and innovative initiatives have helped revitalize communities across the Green Mountain State. Before joining the Burlington Housing Authority as its executive director in November 1995, Paul served for many years with the Vermont State Housing Authority. It was here that Paul created the State's first lead hazard reduction program, which now stands as a model for providing families of all incomes with safe housing. Since the beginning of Paul's tenure at Burlington Housing Authority 20 years ago, Vermont's oldest and largest municipally based housing authority, the organization has grown vastly in size and scope. The Burlington Housing Authority has taken on new development projects, improved homebuyer education, and negotiated critical agreements to prevent homelessness in recent years. Under Paul's direction, the Burlington Housing Authority has upheld a strong mission to support all residents, including refugees, those in transition, or in need of long- term supportive services. Paul's commitment also resulted in a critical partnership with another local organization, Women Helping Battered Women, to create Sophie's Place. Together, these two organizations devised a plan to provide victims of domestic violence easier access to public housing subsidies so that they could move directly from violent homes into safe transitional housing. This solution simultaneously eased suffering, streamlined services, and saved money. This program now functions as a key component of the local economic justice and housing plans and serves as a model for valuable partnerships in my home State. This program is only one of many that I could provide as reference to Paul's great work in Burlington and beyond. Like his many colleagues and friends, I know that the Burlington Housing Authority and the greater housing community will miss Paul's expertise, spirit, and compassion. Marcelle and I extend our best wishes as Paul begins his retirement after a long and distinguished career. I surely hope that Paul will take time to enjoy one of his greatest hobbies in the years ahead--sugarmaking among the sweet sugarbush. Paul Dettman's standard of distinction should be an inspiration to others, just as it has been to the city of Burlington and the State of Vermont. (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.) ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2450] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO PAUL DETTMAN Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that my Republican colleagues continue to play politics with our judicial system. There are currently 79 judicial vacancies in this country--28 of which are judicial emergency vacancies. In each of these districts across the country, Americans are waiting for their cases to be heard, but instead of justice, they are left hanging in the lurch. I have said it before, and I will say it again: Justice delayed is justice denied. Senate Republicans refuse to act to confirm Judge Merrick Garland-- who has more Federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court candidate in history--to the Supreme Court, and they refuse to act on the 20 judicial nominees who were reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. It is outrageous that Senate Republicans stubbornly refuse to move these nominations forward, letting these accomplished and qualified nominees languish. One of those judges is Mark Young, an excellent nominee for the Central District Court of California, which is ranked 11th in the Nation in weighted case filings per judgeship. We need to fill this seat as soon as possible, and Judge Young is an extraordinary candidate. I was honored to introduce him at his nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee last October and go over his impeccable resume. He has served as a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge since 2008 and has 10 years of experience as a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. He holds degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California Gould School of Law; and he has won numerous awards from organizations including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Attorney General's Distinguished Service Award--one of the Department of Justice's highest honors. The people of the Central District of California need his leadership, and the overworked judges of the Central District need his help. We also have two additional candidates from California who are awaiting Judiciary Committee hearings. Judge Paul L. Abrams was nominated by President Obama in December 2015 to serve as the U.S. District Court Judge for the Central District. Judge Abrams is currently a U.S. magistrate judge for the Central District, a post he has held since 2002. He began his career in private practice and then worked as a legal aid lawyer before serving in the Federal public defender's office, eventually becoming a supervising deputy Federal public defender. He holds degrees from the University of California, Berkeley, and Boalt Hall School of Law. Judge Lucy Koh, currently serving in the Northern District, was nominated by President Obama for the Ninth Circuit Court in February of this year. The daughter of Korean immigrants and a Harvard graduate, Judge Koh began her legal career as a Women's Law and Public Policy Fellow for the Senate Judiciary Committee. At the U.S. Department of Justice, she served as a special assistant to the Deputy Attorney General before spending 3 years as a Federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, where she was awarded the Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis J. Freeh Award for Demonstrated Excellence in Prosecuting a Major Criminal Case. She then spent 9 years in private practice. She served on the Superior Court for Santa Clara County until 2010, when she was appointed to the Northern District, becoming the first Korean American woman to serve as a Federal district court judge. Each of these excellent candidates has flawless credentials, broad support, and they are ready to serve. So what are we waiting for? The American people cannot wait for justice--and they shouldn't have to. Let's move forward with giving each of these excellent judicial candidates the consideration and vote that they deserve. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2451] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS Mrs. BOXER.

I was honored to introduce him at his nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee last October and go over his impeccable resume. He has served as a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge since 2008 and has 10 years of experience as a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. He holds degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California Gould School of Law; and he has won numerous awards from organizations including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Attorney General's Distinguished Service Award--one of the Department of Justice's highest honors. The people of the Central District of California need his leadership, and the overworked judges of the Central District need his help. We also have two additional candidates from California who are awaiting Judiciary Committee hearings. Judge Paul L. Abrams was nominated by President Obama in December 2015 to serve as the U.S. District Court Judge for the Central District. Judge Abrams is currently a U.S. magistrate judge for the Central District, a post he has held since 2002. He began his career in private practice and then worked as a legal aid lawyer before serving in the Federal public defender's office, eventually becoming a supervising deputy Federal public defender. He holds degrees from the University of California, Berkeley, and Boalt Hall School of Law. Judge Lucy Koh, currently serving in the Northern District, was nominated by President Obama for the Ninth Circuit Court in February of this year. The daughter of Korean immigrants and a Harvard graduate, Judge Koh began her legal career as a Women's Law and Public Policy Fellow for the Senate Judiciary Committee. At the U.S. Department of Justice, she served as a special assistant to the Deputy Attorney General before spending 3 years as a Federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, where she was awarded the Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis J. Freeh Award for Demonstrated Excellence in Prosecuting a Major Criminal Case. She then spent 9 years in private practice. She served on the Superior Court for Santa Clara County until 2010, when she was appointed to the Northern District, becoming the first Korean American woman to serve as a Federal district court judge. Each of these excellent candidates has flawless credentials, broad support, and they are ready to serve. So what are we waiting for? The American people cannot wait for justice--and they shouldn't have to. Let's move forward with giving each of these excellent judicial candidates the consideration and vote that they deserve. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2451] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that my Republican colleagues continue to play politics with our judicial system. There are currently 79 judicial vacancies in this country--28 of which are judicial emergency vacancies. In each of these districts across the country, Americans are waiting for their cases to be heard, but instead of justice, they are left hanging in the lurch. I have said it before, and I will say it again: Justice delayed is justice denied. Senate Republicans refuse to act to confirm Judge Merrick Garland-- who has more Federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court candidate in history--to the Supreme Court, and they refuse to act on the 20 judicial nominees who were reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. It is outrageous that Senate Republicans stubbornly refuse to move these nominations forward, letting these accomplished and qualified nominees languish. One of those judges is Mark Young, an excellent nominee for the Central District Court of California, which is ranked 11th in the Nation in weighted case filings per judgeship.

CREC-2016-04-26-pt1-PgS2450-3,CREC-2016-04-26,114,AMENDMENT NO. 3202 TO THE ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2450-S2451] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMENDMENT NO. 3202 TO THE ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am very pleased with the Senate's show of support for the Isakson-Bennet amendment, which was a modified version of the Sensible Accounting to Value Energy Act. We have been working on this bill together for more than five years. The SAVE Act simply creates a voluntary program to encourage people to include energy efficiency in the purchase price of a new or existing home. It allows sellers the option of providing a HUD-qualified energy efficiency report to prospective buyers who are applying for a home mortgage. If that loan is backed by FHA, the energy efficiency of the home and the cost of a borrower's future energy bills will be taken into account by the mortgage lender. Builders and manufacturers are constantly creating new energy efficient products and features, but the enhanced value and energy savings achieved by these innovations are not fully realized by the market. The passage of this amendment will for the first time provide a mechanism to account for those saving and unlock demand for new energy efficient products [[Page S2451]] and significantly reduce homeowner's utility bills. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question? I would like to commend my colleagues for their support for energy efficiency programs that reduce residential energy consumption. Expanding the use of these technologies in our everyday lives is a commitment to our future and will create jobs in Ohio. However, I am also concerned that adjusting underwriting or appraisal requirements without sufficient protections to ensure a family has the ability to repay their loan could have unintended consequences that put our housing market at risk, which I know is not the intention of the sponsors. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the comments made by the Senator from Ohio. I also support the need for greater energy efficiency and applaud the sponsors of this amendment for promoting greater energy efficiency. At the same time, I do have some concerns. Specifically, I am concerned about whether and how potential energy savings can safely be incorporated as part of the mortgage underwriting process at the FHA, especially when there may not be a consensus on how to define and accurately quantify future energy savings. Another concern is the interaction of estimated energy savings in the underwriting and appraisal processes. This could happen because the SAVE Act requires expected energy cost savings to be used as an offset to certain regular expenses, such as property taxes, while also requiring the estimated energy savings of a home to be added to the home's appraisal. While not the intent of the authors, I am concerned that this could tilt the mortgage market towards more expensive products without adequate safeguards to protect borrowers. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we would ask the sponsors of this amendment to work with us to ensure that we can accomplish our shared goals of encouraging investment in energy efficient homes while also maintaining a safe and sound mortgage market for homebuyers. Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, moving forward, we intend to work with the Senate Banking Committee and HUD to address any technical or substantive concerns that have arisen. Specifically, it is our intention to ensure that FHA has the ability to insure loans for energy efficient homes while also including protections to maintain accurate evaluations of a borrower's ability to repay. Additionally, as this amendment is being implemented, we understand that HUD's ability to test and modify the savings that may be counted should be considered. In fact, we considered these concerns while drafting this legislation. The methodology we included for measuring energy efficient savings is an ANSI certified standard and the most widely accepted technology in today's marketplace. Over 1 million homes have already been energy rated using this technology. And this is the same underlying technology successfully utilized by the EPA's Energy Star program. Again, we are pleased that the Senate passed our amendment, and we look forward to working with the Banking Committee and HUD on improvements. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2450-S2451] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMENDMENT NO. 3202 TO THE ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL Mr. BENNET.

CREC-2016-04-26-pt1-PgS2451-2,CREC-2016-04-26,114,40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RELEASE OF THE CHURCH COMMITTEE REPORT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2451-S2452] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RELEASE OF THE CHURCH COMMITTEE REPORT Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the release of the report by the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, better known as the Church Committee. On this day in 1976, the first of five books detailing egregious abuses of power by the intelligence community was released by the Church Committee. The report was the first ever comprehensive oversight study of the intelligence community, which had operated largely without any oversight since its founding during World War II. Prior to this study, the Intelligence Committees did not exist in either the Senate or the House, and there was no formal apparatus to check the actions of the Nation's intelligence community. The Church Committee truly was the first of its kind. It grew out of extraordinary circumstances during a period [[Page S2452]] of national soul-searching in the shadow of the Vietnam war and Watergate scandal. In the early 1970s, a series of abuses were revealed in the press, including an expose alleging that the CIA had been spying on antiwar activists around the country. The American people were understandably outraged, and in response, the Senate convened a committee to conduct a comprehensive review of all intelligence activities. The committee--under the chairmanship of Idaho Senator Frank Church, with Texas Senator John Tower as vice chairman--was comprised of 11 Senators and 133 dedicated staff members. Over the next 15 months, the staff poured over millions of CIA and FBI records to produce a 2,500- page report broken into 6 unique books, each covering a different topic including foreign assassinations, domestic spying, and an investigation into the killing of President Kennedy. What they discovered was shocking, including vast abuses both domestic and abroad that showed the intelligence community operated outside the framework of the Constitution and undermined the Bill of Rights. The committee found that, in the decades leading up to and including the 1970s, the CIA and FBI had been conducting a massive, illegal domestic spying operation, which included the following: The CIA opened and photographed over one-quarter million pieces of domestic mail, the FBI maintained extensive files on over half a million American citizens, and the NSA wiretapped all international calls from the United States and documented the callers. In addition to mass data collection, the agencies conducted targeted operations as well. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., was the subject of an aggressive surveillance program overseen by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover sought to compile a detailed record of King's personal life in order to blackmail and delegitimize him as a public figure. King's phone was tapped without a warrant, for example. The NAACP, Black Panthers, and antiwar groups were also all spied upon. In fact, President Eisenhower on several occasions received advanced copies of NAACP speeches from informants. The abuses didn't stop at our border. The Church Committee uncovered evidence that the CIA had plotted or engaged in assisting in the assassination plots of the leaders of Cuba, the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Chile, and South Vietnam. In the Congo, the CIA reached the final stages of a plot to assassinate Patrice Lumumba and had even delivered poison to its agents. However, before the plan was carried out, Lumumba was executed following a coup. Most infamously, the United States conspired in numerous plots against Fidel Castro, though none were ever carried out. The public airing of these--and other--allegations shook our country and our partners abroad and prompted swift action by Congress and the executive branch. On February 18, 1976, President Ford issued Executive Order No. 11905, banning all assassinations. The order has stood ever since. Within months of the release of the Church Committee report, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was formed by a vote of 72 to 22. The committee was established to conduct constant and vigorous oversight over the intelligence community. In addition, in 1978, Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which established the FISA Court to oversee requests for intelligence warrants within the United States. The Church Committee study revealed to the world the danger of allowing intelligence agencies to operate in the shadows and with unchecked power. Our duty to conduct oversight is one I take very seriously. As the chairman of the Intelligence Committee from 2009 to 2015 and as vice chairman since 2015, I have undertaken this responsibility with the awareness that, without the efforts of the Church Committee, congressional oversight of the intelligence community would never have been possible. We must also remember that the Church Committee and its reports had their vocal and adamant opponents. Oversight is, at times, resisted, a fact we discovered firsthand in completing and declassifying as the Committee's Study of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. The legacy of the Church Committee report lives on in the study the Intelligence Committee released in 2014. The study reviewed over 6.3 million cables, emails, memoranda, and transcripts. It is a documentary history of the CIA's words and actions in the years during which the CIA conceived of, carried out, and made representations about its Detention and Interrogation Program. The public is familiar with the report's 500-page executive summary and findings and conclusions that were declassified and released. The full study is over 6,700 pages long and includes 38,000 footnotes. To this day, critics of the study have not demonstrated a single factual inaccuracy. Among many revelations, the study showed that, contrary to the CIA's claims, the use of torture was brutal and did not result in otherwise unavailable intelligence that ``saved lives.'' It also demonstrated that the CIA provided inaccurate information about the program to the White House, the Department of Justice, to Congress, and the public. Much like the Church Committee report before it, the study demonstrated the important role oversight plays in securing our country's commitment to the rule of law. The importance of the work the Church Committee did back in 1975 and 1976 cannot be understated. Our government operates on the basis of trust from the American people. The oath each of us take in public service is to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. The actions of the intelligence community leading up to the Church Committee violated that trust and must never be repeated. Senator Church and his committee, in shedding light on these dark times, helped right the ship of American democracy and set an important example for all future Members of this body of how to conduct vigilant and thorough oversight. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2451-S2452] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RELEASE OF THE CHURCH COMMITTEE REPORT Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the release of the report by the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, better known as the Church Committee. On this day in 1976, the first of five books detailing egregious abuses of power by the intelligence community was released by the Church Committee. The report was the first ever comprehensive oversight study of the intelligence community, which had operated largely without any oversight since its founding during World War II. Prior to this study, the Intelligence Committees did not exist in either the Senate or the House, and there was no formal apparatus to check the actions of the Nation's intelligence community. The Church Committee truly was the first of its kind. It grew out of extraordinary circumstances during a period [[Page S2452]] of national soul-searching in the shadow of the Vietnam war and Watergate scandal. In the early 1970s, a series of abuses were revealed in the press, including an expose alleging that the CIA had been spying on antiwar activists around the country. The American people were understandably outraged, and in response, the Senate convened a committee to conduct a comprehensive review of all intelligence activities. The committee--under the chairmanship of Idaho Senator Frank Church, with Texas Senator John Tower as vice chairman--was comprised of 11 Senators and 133 dedicated staff members. Over the next 15 months, the staff poured over millions of CIA and FBI records to produce a 2,500- page report broken into 6 unique books, each covering a different topic including foreign assassinations, domestic spying, and an investigation into the killing of President Kennedy. What they discovered was shocking, including vast abuses both domestic and abroad that showed the intelligence community operated outside the framework of the Constitution and undermined the Bill of Rights. The committee found that, in the decades leading up to and including the 1970s, the CIA and FBI had been conducting a massive, illegal domestic spying operation, which included the following: The CIA opened and photographed over one-quarter million pieces of domestic mail, the FBI maintained extensive files on over half a million American citizens, and the NSA wiretapped all international calls from the United States and documented the callers. In addition to mass data collection, the agencies conducted targeted operations as well. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., was the subject of an aggressive surveillance program overseen by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover sought to compile a detailed record of King's personal life in order to blackmail and delegitimize him as a public figure. King's phone was tapped without a warrant, for example. The NAACP, Black Panthers, and antiwar groups were also all spied upon. In fact, President Eisenhower on several occasions received advanced copies of NAACP speeches from informants. The abuses didn't stop at our border. The Church Committee uncovered evidence that the CIA had plotted or engaged in assisting in the assassination plots of the leaders of Cuba, the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Chile, and South Vietnam. In the Congo, the CIA reached the final stages of a plot to assassinate Patrice Lumumba and had even delivered poison to its agents. However, before the plan was carried out, Lumumba was executed following a coup. Most infamously, the United States conspired in numerous plots against Fidel Castro, though none were ever carried out. The public airing of these--and other--allegations shook our country and our partners abroad and prompted swift action by Congress and the executive branch. On February 18, 1976, President Ford issued Executive Order No. 11905, banning all assassinations. The order has stood ever since. Within months of the release of the Church Committee report, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was formed by a vote of 72 to 22. The committee was established to conduct constant and vigorous oversight over the intelligence community. In addition, in 1978, Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which established the FISA Court to oversee requests for intelligence warrants within the United States. The Church Committee study revealed to the world the danger of allowing intelligence agencies to operate in the shadows and with unchecked power. Our duty to conduct oversight is one I take very seriously.

METRUCK,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2453] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL STEPHEN P. METRUCK Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I wish to honor U.S. Coast Guard RADM Stephen P. Metruck and highlight his service to country and his contribution to the State of Delaware. Rear Admiral Metruck retired on April 22 from commanding the Fifth Coast Guard District after 34 years in the U.S. Coast Guard. The fifth district includes North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, Washington, DC, and much of Pennsylvania. Rear Admiral Metruck led 67 units made up of 2,475 Active Duty members, 1,010 Reservists, 6,800 auxiliary members, and 120 civilians. One of Rear Admiral Metruck's most notable accomplishments occurred during his tenure at both Sector San Diego and Sector Seattle. In these dual roles, Rear Admiral Metruck was responsible for advancing Coast Guard operations in a post-9/11 environment. He forged interagency partnerships to enhance safety and security measures in each port and coordinated the sensors and systems into a common operational picture to allow all agencies to coordinate and understand potential threats in the maritime environment. Rear Admiral Metruck and I got to know each other well during harsh, back-to-back winters that damaged navigation aids along the Delaware River, which assisted ships traveling to and from Wilmington, DE. From this experience, I learned that it is not easy budgeting for ice flows. Being an expert at budgeting and solving problems, he and his team forged solutions that replaced damaged buoys and aids to navigation without a huge burden on taxpayers. The result was ships could again travel safely to ports in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Rear Admiral Metruck is a very humble man, and he will be the first to understate his contribution to the U.S. Coast Guard and leadership of the men and women under his command. Nevertheless, I have found him to be an extremely devoted public servant and skilled at working with other agencies, solving problems, and being responsive to inquiries from Senators. Rear Admiral Metruck also spent 2\1/2\ years serving this great institution as a fellow with then-Senator John Kerry. He worked on policy issues related to the Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries and also supported Senator Kerry's staff on environmental, maritime, and Coast Guard issues and legislation. Prior to arriving at the Fifth Coast Guard District, he was the assistant commandant for resources and chief financial officer for the U.S. Coast Guard. During this assignment, he was responsible for all Coast Guard financial management and resource activities including planning, programming, budgeting, and execution of the service's $10 billion annual appropriation. While he has been a friend of commerce and the environment on the Delaware River, his career has resulted in him living in and serving a number of other States. He has served in Coast Guard Headquarters; Portsmouth, VA; Brownsville, TX; Tampa, FL; Buffalo, NY; San Diego, CA; and Puget Sound, WA. Rear Admiral Metruck also helped oversee Coast Guard missions across waterways encompassing the states of California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and the offshore waters of Mexico and Central America. Additionally, he served as U.S. Coast Guard Liaison to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York City. Rear Admiral Metruck is from Massena, NY, and graduated in 1982 from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, where he earned a bachelor of science degree in ocean engineering. He was awarded a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He has also served as a military fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC, and the Coast Guard fellow on the Chief of Naval Operation's Strategic Studies Group based in Newport, RI. There are many of us in this Chamber who have worked with him and his staff on important issues over the years. Today I express our collective gratitude to him for devoting his career to keeping us safe. I speak for many in the Senate, in Delaware, and around our Nation in wishing Rear Admiral Metruck and his wife Peggy Duxbury a great next chapter in their lives. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2453] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL STEPHEN P.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 101st anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Between 1915 and 1923, the Ottoman Empire executed a deliberate massacre of more than 1.5 million Armenians. Over the course of 8 years, Armenians were marched to their deaths in the deserts of the Middle East, murdered in concentration camps, drowned at sea, and forced to endure unimaginable acts of brutality. These barbaric acts were systematic, methodical, and intentional. More than 100 years have passed since the start of that horrific massacre, which an overwhelming number of academics and institutions have recognized as genocide, and there are countless testimonies from victims who lived to tell of their harrowing experiences. Pope Francis called the massacre against the Armenians ``the first genocide of the 20th century,'' declaring that ``concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.'' However, despite an irrefutable body of evidence, the U.S. Government has refused to call the deliberate massacre of the Armenians by its rightful name: genocide. For years, I have urged both Democratic and Republican administrations to acknowledge the truth of the Armenian genocide. Today I reiterate my call, and I hope that, this year, the United States will finally correct this century-old injustice. By affirming the Armenian genocide, the United States would join more than 20 countries across the globe--including Russia, France, and Germany--as well as the Vatican and 43 U.S. States standing on the right side of history. Recognizing the Armenian genocide is much more than a symbolic gesture. It will provide solace and relief to the descendants of the victims, particularly the hundreds of thousands of Armenian American citizens and residents. It will support a more equitable reconciliation between the Turkish and [[Page S2453]] Armenian people. And most importantly, it will reaffirm U.S. leadership in preventing and responding to similar atrocities and in advancing the rights of vulnerable populations around the world. This year, as we take time to remember and honor the victims of the Armenian genocide, I hope the United States will finally stand on the right side of history and affirm the incontestable fact of the Armenian genocide. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2452-S2453] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 101ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor a man who has served faithfully for 27 years in the U.S. Air Force, with the vast majority of that service in the Missouri Air National Guard. It is a big loss, but Col. Michael Francis is scheduled to depart the 131st Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base on May 15, 2016, after a long and distinguished record of service in the unit beginning July 28, 1998. I think it is important to note that Colonel Francis has been associated with a unit whose history has spanned over nine decades and whose former members have included the likes of aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh. Colonel Francis commissioned in the U.S. Air Force in 1989 as a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and, after almost a decade, transitioned from Active Duty to the Air National Guard, continuing his dream of a career as a fighter pilot in the F-15 Eagle. Throughout Colonel Francis's service at the 131st, he has seen the unit transition from the F-15, the Nation's premier homeland defense and air superiority aircraft, to the B-2, the Nation's lethal stealth bomber involved in global missions. Since being chosen to command the first B-2 Operations Group in the Air National Guard when the 131st transitioned from the F-15 Eagle to the B-2 Spirit, Colonel Francis has been a standout leader in the nuclear community. His achievements boast nothing less than perfection. As the present wing commander, Colonel Francis paved a new path for the National Guard by leading his unit to be the first bomb wing certified for full-spectrum nuclear operations and was entrusted with strategic nuclear deterrent operations for our country. Throughout his long career at the 131st, Colonel Francis remained dedicated to the vital missions of the Air National Guard. However, he also never forgot his commitment to his wife, Jane, and sons, Greg and Brian. While Colonel Francis might be leaving the 131st Bomb Wing, he will continue his selflessness in service to this great country. Colonel Francis will be reassigned to the Missouri National Guard Headquarters and promoted to brigadier general. Again, I wish to extend Col. Michael J. Francis my sincere congratulations upon his new assignment and thanks for the years of service he has rendered to the 131st Bomb Wing, the State of Missouri, and the Nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2453] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO COLONEL MICHAEL FRANCIS Mr. BLUNT.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the outstanding service of Black Hills National Forest supervisor, Craig Bobzien, as he retires from the U.S. Forest Service. Craig was placed in charge of managing the Black Hills National Forest in May 2005, and for more than 10 years, the Black Hills National Forest has been under Craig's direct supervision. Craig began his path to South Dakota as a 1973 graduate of Raytown South High School in Raytown, MO. After high school, he pursued his bachelor's degree in forest science at Colorado State University and then went on to a serve in many roles in conservation and forestry. Previous to his appointment at the Black Hills National Forest, he served in other capacities for the U.S. Forest Service in Idaho, Montana, Washington State, and at the U.S. Forest Service headquarters in Washington, DC. Since being appointed to oversee the Black Hills National Forest, Craig has been its longest serving supervisor. Over his tenure of almost 11 years, Craig has done an exceptional job as a steward of the Black Hills National Forest's 1.2 million acres in South Dakota and Wyoming. He managed those 1.2 million acres of forestland during some of the toughest fire seasons in recent memory. Craig's leadership during the Rocky Mountain Region's devastating pine beetle epidemic has been instrumental as he coordinated with other Federal, State, and private stakeholders to combat one of the largest epidemics of this pest since the 1900s. Craig initiated the first large-landscape management area in the Black Hills National Forest for mountain pine beetle treatment, which has set an example of topline management others are now following. Over the years, I have appreciated the cooperation of Craig and his team of over 300 employees in our efforts to assess and address the many threats to the health of the Black Hills. Craig, thank you for your service to South Dakota and our Nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2454] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO CRAIG BOBZIEN Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Hugh McDonald, president of Entergy Arkansas, as he prepares to retire. Hugh McDonald is a resident of Little Rock and has been with Entergy since 1982. He holds a bachelor's of science degree in construction management from North Dakota State University and a master of business administration degree from the University of New Orleans. Hugh began his career at Entergy over 30 years ago in Louisiana, where he rose through the ranks before being promoted to director of regulatory affairs for Entergy Texas and then senior vice president of energy retail operations. He came to Arkansas 16 years ago to accept his current position. Entergy Arkansas provides electricity to approximately 700,000 customers in 63 counties and is a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation. As the head of Arkansas' largest utility, McDonald demonstrated excellent leadership during his 16-year tenure. He led its decision to withdraw from the system agreement that forced Arkansas ratepayers to partially bear the cost of producing electricity in other Entergy States. He also spearheaded the movement to join the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which allowed greater access to economic generation resources and saved Arkansas customers $46 million in the first year of participation. Hugh is a past board member and board chair of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He also serves on the boards of the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce, the Arkansas Research Alliance Board, the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce, and Fifty for the Future. In addition, Hugh serves on the boards of the University of Arkansas Sam Walton College of Business Advisory Board, the UALR College of Business Advisory Council, the UAMS BioVentures Advisory Board, and the Nature Conservancy of Arkansas. Let me reiterate how grateful I am for Hugh McDonald's management and vision during his time at the helm of Entergy Arkansas. His guidance and stewardship of the company has resulted in vital, reliable electricity for thousands of Arkansans across the State. I thank Hugh for his distinguished career and wish him well in retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2454] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ TRIBUTE TO HUGH McDONALD Mr. BOOZMAN.

Mr. President, I would like to honor Mary Lorraine Wood Borman of Fayetteville, AR, as this week's Arkansan of the Week for her commitment to the National Down Syndrome Society as a self- advocate ambassador for the great State of Arkansas. Her advocacy to improve the quality of life for those living with down syndrome is noteworthy, and she is a joy and inspiration to many across the state. Outside of her work as an activist, Mary is an involved and multitalented junior at Fayetteville High School in Fayetteville, AR. Not only does she excel academically--as indicated by her track record as an honor roll student--but she is also a gifted athlete and has won awards in swimming events at the Arkansas State Special Olympic Games for 3 years. Mary is also a talented dancer and actress, specializing in hip-hop, jazz, and the waltz. I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mary when she visited my Washington, DC, office while in town for the Buddy Walk hosted each year by the National Down Syndrome Society. Because of Mary's advocacy and compelling reasoning, I cosponsored the ABLE to Work Act of 2016 shortly after our meeting. This bill will help persons with disabilities save additional amounts in their ABLE accounts. Mary has big dreams, and I am confident she will achieve them. I look forward to keeping track of her many accomplishments. Arkansas is lucky to have someone like Mary Borman fighting to make our State a better place, and I applaud her for her work. Her story is a testimony of the spirit of Arkansans, and I am certain it will inspire others to take action on causes that they believe in. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2454] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MARY LORRAINE WOOD BORMAN Mr. COTTON.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th Anniversary of the Associated Logging Contractors of Idaho. The Associated Logging Contractors, Inc., of Idaho, ALC, have an important voice in advocating for policies that support an essential sector of Idaho--the logging and wood-hauling industry. Throughout the past 50 years since its organization, the association has worked to serve its purpose of ``developing programs that are instrumental in helping members to reduce costs of operation and to craft creative solutions to problems confronting the industry.'' ALC represents nearly 400 independent logging contractor businesses from across Idaho. From Endangered Species Act reform, to boosting rural economies, to addressing forest health and much more, the ALC has been involved in a wide range of discussions central to Idaho. I value the organization's and its members' input and involvement in shaping solutions to our natural resources challenges. We have much work ahead, but progress is being made on public lands issues to the benefit of Idahoans and our economy. Positive developments in job opportunities and more timber identified for harvest for the betterment of forest health are the result of the State and Federal Government working more closely with private landowners and the logging community to make progress toward the removal of salvage timber from last year's fires. While challenging, collaboration is working, and ALC members have been instrumental in advancing this effort. The organization has much to be proud of for its efforts in bringing folks together to achieve solutions and working toward their implementation. Collaboration is difficult but indispensable work, as it brings lasting advancements for habitats, recreation, rural economies, and job production. I have greatly valued ALC member's support of local collaborative efforts. Congratulations to the members of the Associated Logging Contractors of Idaho on 50 years of accomplishments. Thank you for your hard work building up our great State and Nation. I wish you all the best for continued success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2455] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ASSOCIATED LOGGING CONTRACTORS, INC., OF IDAHO Mr. CRAPO.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Tennessee urging the United States Congress to mandate, and provide an adequate budget for, the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to establish rules for manufacturing, siting, and licensing of small modular reactors and liquid core molten salt reactors to be built and operated in the United States by private industry for the production of energy and medical isotopes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. House Joint Resolution No. 507 Whereas, Tennessee has many finite natural energy resources; and Whereas, world energy demand and usage are expected to increase; and Whereas, is vital to the country's energy future to provide abundant base-load power and peaking energy-on-demand power affordably; and Whereas, extending Tennessee's current energy boom will require the creation of a long-term energy plan and the development of clean and affordable energy technologies such as liquid core molten salt reactors and small modular reactors; and Whereas, the United States of America possesses a nearly inexhaustible supply of thorium and uranium (more than a billion years' supply of energy) that dramatically exceeds all known potential energy reserves; and Whereas, the elements thorium and uranium have the practical potential to provide unlimited energy resources for Tennesseans and Americans on demand in the near future and to provide many other tangible benefits; and Whereas, better utilization of thorium and uranium in specially designed reactors such as molten salt reactors, including liquid fluoride thorium reactors, can provide energy security from other nations by utilizing Tennessee coal and a reactor's nuclear heat energy to produce an abundance of synthetic liquid transportation fuels. These synthetic fuels can be produced for many future generations of Tennesseans in a safe, affordable, and most environmentally friendly manner; and Whereas, the efficient use of thorium or uranium in a specially designed molten salt reactor allows for greatly increased environmentally friendly energy production that improves the economics of many recycling technologies and raises the standard of living; and Whereas, it is incumbent upon this body to be forward- thinking in addressing the future energy challenges for the next generation of Tennesseans; and Whereas, Tennessee is uniquely capable to commercialize small modular reactors, liquid core molten salt reactors, and integral fast reactors with its research and development assets of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where such technology was first developed, and other private companies and nonprofit organizations that specialize in nuclear technology development in Tennessee; and Whereas, the academic, scientific, manufacturing, and business communities in Tennessee have some of the best talent and research and development records in the world. Development of this groundbreaking and economic game-changing technology would serve Tennessee's and America's economics better than current federal efforts to develop this technology in partnership with China; and Whereas, advanced technology using thorium and uranium can affordably provide medical isotopes of materials for medical uses such as treating cancer and HIV/AIDS, diagnostic procedures, and improved health care; and Whereas, S.99, the ``American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2011,'' was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 2, 2013, and mandates a reliable domestic supply of molybdenum-99 for medical imaging and diagnostics; and Whereas, molybdenum-99 is used in more than sixteen million medical procedures annually in the United States; and Whereas, no domestic supply of molybdenum-99 currently exists, and present suppliers use old reactors that result in frequent supply disruptions; and Whereas, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, charged with licensing nuclear reactors, is not well-funded for establishing procedures for new, advanced reactor designs based on different architectures from today's fleet of light water reactors; and Whereas, small modular reactors and liquid core molten salt reactors represent a business opportunity that Tennessee's manufacturing base is well-suited to exploit. This could potentially result in creating forty thousand manufacturing jobs in total within Tennessee, because these jobs have the ability to complement Tennessee's coal industry, oil industry, and natural gas hydraulic fracturing industry by increasing jobs in those industries: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives of the One Hundred Ninth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the Senate Concurring, That the General Assembly supports the creation of a long-term energy plan that addresses the long-term energy needs of the state; and be it further Resolved, That the General Assembly encourages and supports the research and development of liquid-core-molten-salt- reactor and small-modular-reactor technologies as a long-term solution to Tennessee's energy needs; and be it further Resolved, That the General Assembly urges the Congress of the United States to mandate, and provide an adequate budget for, the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to establish rules for manufacturing, siting, and licensing of small modular reactors and liquid core molten salt reactors to be built and operated in the United States by private industry for the production of energy and medical isotopes; and be it further Resolved, That the General Assembly supports investing in, acquiring grants for, implementing programs for, encouraging Tennessee institutions of higher learning to conduct research into, and attracting companies for the development of future technologies that will provide greater energy resources more affordably, abundantly, and in a more environmentally friendly manner than is being done at present; and be it further Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives transmit certified copies of this resolution to the President of the United States, the Secretary of the United States Department of Energy, the Commissioners of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, and each member of the Tennessee Congressional delegation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2457] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS The following petition or memorial was laid before the Senate and was referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: POM-159.

Development of this groundbreaking and economic game-changing technology would serve Tennessee's and America's economics better than current federal efforts to develop this technology in partnership with China; and Whereas, advanced technology using thorium and uranium can affordably provide medical isotopes of materials for medical uses such as treating cancer and HIV/AIDS, diagnostic procedures, and improved health care; and Whereas, S.99, the ``American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2011,'' was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 2, 2013, and mandates a reliable domestic supply of molybdenum-99 for medical imaging and diagnostics; and Whereas, molybdenum-99 is used in more than sixteen million medical procedures annually in the United States; and Whereas, no domestic supply of molybdenum-99 currently exists, and present suppliers use old reactors that result in frequent supply disruptions; and Whereas, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, charged with licensing nuclear reactors, is not well-funded for establishing procedures for new, advanced reactor designs based on different architectures from today's fleet of light water reactors; and Whereas, small modular reactors and liquid core molten salt reactors represent a business opportunity that Tennessee's manufacturing base is well-suited to exploit. This could potentially result in creating forty thousand manufacturing jobs in total within Tennessee, because these jobs have the ability to complement Tennessee's coal industry, oil industry, and natural gas hydraulic fracturing industry by increasing jobs in those industries: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives of the One Hundred Ninth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the Senate Concurring, That the General Assembly supports the creation of a long-term energy plan that addresses the long-term energy needs of the state; and be it further Resolved, That the General Assembly encourages and supports the research and development of liquid-core-molten-salt- reactor and small-modular-reactor technologies as a long-term solution to Tennessee's energy needs; and be it further Resolved, That the General Assembly urges the Congress of the United States to mandate, and provide an adequate budget for, the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to establish rules for manufacturing, siting, and licensing of small modular reactors and liquid core molten salt reactors to be built and operated in the United States by private industry for the production of energy and medical isotopes; and be it further Resolved, That the General Assembly supports investing in, acquiring grants for, implementing programs for, encouraging Tennessee institutions of higher learning to conduct research into, and attracting companies for the development of future technologies that will provide greater energy resources more affordably, abundantly, and in a more environmentally friendly manner than is being done at present; and be it further Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives transmit certified copies of this resolution to the President of the United States, the Secretary of the United States Department of Energy, the Commissioners of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, and each member of the Tennessee Congressional delegation. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,6778,6778,6846,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [senate] [page s2457] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] petitions and memorials the following petition or memorial was laid before the senate and was referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: pom-159. a joint resolution adopted by the legislature of the state of tennessee urging the united states congress to mandate, and provide an adequate budget for, the department of energy and the nuclear regulatory commission to establish rules for manufacturing, siting, and licensing of small modular reactors and liquid core molten salt reactors to be built and operated in the united states by private industry for the production of energy and medical isotopes;

While on that trip, he made a grave mistake. He whistled at a White woman. Because of that, Emmett Till was killed. The investigation that resulted from his death culminated in a 67-minute deliberation by a jury that found both men and acquitted them. Both individuals, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam confessed to the murder in 1956. In our criminal justice system, when you are found not guilty, you can't be retried. There was an injustice that was done. In this particular case, the injustice was done to Emmett Till, a 14-year-old. Without an understanding of how many people might have been affected by the same lack of justice applied equally, there was a self-taught individual that became an activist. His name was Alvin Sykes. Alvin Sykes became a civil rights advocate. He was a cold case researcher. Through the frustration of trying to get a bill to the U.S. Senate that my good friend Tom Coburn held up, Alvin Sykes did what most people don't do in this town. Rather than hold a press conference to talk about a civil rights bill, he called Tom Coburn and said: I would like to see you. He sat down with Tom Coburn, and Tom said: What is it you are trying to do? The two bonded at that point, and they rewrote the bill to reflect what Tom felt was the right legislative approach to create in this country--and fund, I might add--an effort to look back at all potential civil rights cases that were pre-1969. Since the bill's passage, I think in 2008, the Department of Justice, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, along with local law enforcement, has gone through 113 cases. I might add that 15 are still open, and in one they found a reason to convict an individual in the year 2010 from a case pre-1969. So let me say for my colleagues, we will introduce a bill to reauthorize this act. Why? Very simply, because just last year, the Cold Case Justice Initiative at Syracuse University identified 196 potential cases that weren't caught when the Justice Department and the FBI looked at their cold case files. Now, when Senator Coburn and Alvin Sykes put this legislation together, they funded the effort with a mere $13 million. With that $13 million, it created an effort within the Justice Department in the Civil Rights Division and in the FBI. What we found is that it is never too late to go back and fix mistakes that you make. So I will ask my colleagues at some point in the not too distant future, probably by unanimous consent, to pass the Emmett Till Civil Rights Crime Reauthorization Act of 2016. What this does differently than what the original piece of legislation did that Tom Coburn and Alvin Sykes hammered out is that it reauthorizes within the existing offices of the FBI and the Department of Justice and it more clearly delineates the responsibility of the deputy crime chief of the DOJ Civil Rights Division and provides for a joint task force for enhanced collaboration. It eliminates the pre-1970 date, and says that if the law was applied unequally, it doesn't matter when it was, and we should look at it. It eliminates the sunset provision on the Emmett Till law. This is a permanent piece of legislation, where the DOJ and FBI will consult with civil rights organizations, universities, and other entities to reach out and pull in potentially any other cases that should be reviewed. Of course, it allows for the Department of Justice to reopen certain cold cases that merit a second review as necessary, and it maintains the current funding levels. It is a very worthy bill to support. As much as I would really like to make my comments about Emmett Till, I can fill in a number of potentially different names. But the name I want to come to the floor to talk about is Alvin Sykes. Alvin Sykes is a self-taught civil rights advocate, a person who taught himself how to do these investigations into civil rights cases, a guy who is passionate about trying to bring justice to individuals who are no longer here. We are lobbied on Capitol Hill all the time by people who have an interest--it could be personal or it could be professional--in a particular issue. Alvin Sykes had nobody lobbying. They were dead. Alvin Sykes saw a potential injustice in our judicial system and spent a lifetime passionately pursuing how he as one individual could make this right. This is a tremendous success story about something that Congress has done that is good. What we need to do is extend the good work of Tom Coburn and, more importantly, the passion of Alvin Sykes to say that not only was this needed then but it is needed now and into the future. So I come to you today to give you a preview before this bill is presented and to thank my cosponsors, Senator Leahy, Senator McCaskill, and Senator Blunt, but more importantly, to thank Alvin Sykes. Without Alvin Sykes' passion and commitment, this injustice wouldn't have been brought to the attention of Tom Coburn, and Tom Coburn wouldn't have used his incredible passion to pass this bill originally. It is my hope that we can make not only Alvin Sykes proud of the work of the Senate but that, in a small way, it might send a message to those who are related to Emmett Till and to the hundreds of others who might have been served an injustice and so that their relatives can understand that they did have value and that value is for others--that they may not be exposed to an injustice in the future. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be part of the bicameral and bipartisan introduction for the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Reauthorization Act of 2016. There has been no stronger advocate on this bill than my friend, John Lewis, and I am proud to stand with him on this effort. In 2008, we passed this bill to strengthen the Federal Government's ability to investigate and prosecute unsolved murders from the civil rights era. The bill expires in fiscal year 2017, but it is important that we reauthorize the bill prior to its expiration so that the Department of Justice can continue its work on these unsolved cases, uninterrupted. More than 60 years ago, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American teenager, was brutally murdered, but no one was ever punished for it. His death was a pivotal--and tragic--moment in the Civil Rights era, and it continues to serve as a reminder that too many families suffer from the unsolved murders of their loved ones during the civil rights era without receiving justice. The way to best serve these families is to provide our Federal Government with the tools it needs to investigate these unsolved crimes, and to hopefully, bring some sense of closure for these families. The bill we are introducing today does just that. Since the bill's passage in 2008, the Justice Department and others have been assisting families in their quest for justice in resolving these unsolved murders. Specifically, the Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project of Northeastern University and the Cold Case Justice Initiative at the Syracuse University College of Law have both served as invaluable resources and guides for these families. I thank them for their work on these cases, as well as their input in improving this bill. Besides reauthorizing the bill, we have made some changes to address the issues that the families and the organizations have raised. This bill will improve coordination between the various law enforcement branches and the organizations involved; increase transparency and accountability; and continue to resolve these cases without concern of the legislation sunsetting. I thank Congressman Lewis for his tireless work on behalf of the families of these victims of unsolved murders from the civil rights era. I also thank Senator McCaskill of Missouri, Senator Burr of North Carolina, and Senator Blunt of Missouri, who have joined us in introducing this bipartisan bill. I hope that Senators Burr and Blunt can convince the Republican Chairman to move this bill through the Judiciary Committee and Republican Leadership to give this bill a vote on the floor. The road to justice can be long and winding, but we must continue to do our part to help these families obtain justice and closure for their losses.

CREC-2016-04-26-pt1-PgS2460-2,CREC-2016-04-26,114,Introductory Statement on S. 2854,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2460-S2462] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. BURR (for himself, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Blunt): S. 2854. A bill to reauthorize the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today I, along with Senator Leahy, Senator McCaskill, and Senator Blunt, will introduce the reauthorization of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. [[Page S2461]] To give a little bit of history for my colleagues on this, this really stems from 1955, and it was the summer of 1955 when a young 14- year-old left Chicago, IL, and traveled to Mississippi to visit relatives. While on that trip, he made a grave mistake. He whistled at a White woman. Because of that, Emmett Till was killed. The investigation that resulted from his death culminated in a 67-minute deliberation by a jury that found both men and acquitted them. Both individuals, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam confessed to the murder in 1956. In our criminal justice system, when you are found not guilty, you can't be retried. There was an injustice that was done. In this particular case, the injustice was done to Emmett Till, a 14-year-old. Without an understanding of how many people might have been affected by the same lack of justice applied equally, there was a self-taught individual that became an activist. His name was Alvin Sykes. Alvin Sykes became a civil rights advocate. He was a cold case researcher. Through the frustration of trying to get a bill to the U.S. Senate that my good friend Tom Coburn held up, Alvin Sykes did what most people don't do in this town. Rather than hold a press conference to talk about a civil rights bill, he called Tom Coburn and said: I would like to see you. He sat down with Tom Coburn, and Tom said: What is it you are trying to do? The two bonded at that point, and they rewrote the bill to reflect what Tom felt was the right legislative approach to create in this country--and fund, I might add--an effort to look back at all potential civil rights cases that were pre-1969. Since the bill's passage, I think in 2008, the Department of Justice, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, along with local law enforcement, has gone through 113 cases. I might add that 15 are still open, and in one they found a reason to convict an individual in the year 2010 from a case pre-1969. So let me say for my colleagues, we will introduce a bill to reauthorize this act. Why? Very simply, because just last year, the Cold Case Justice Initiative at Syracuse University identified 196 potential cases that weren't caught when the Justice Department and the FBI looked at their cold case files. Now, when Senator Coburn and Alvin Sykes put this legislation together, they funded the effort with a mere $13 million. With that $13 million, it created an effort within the Justice Department in the Civil Rights Division and in the FBI. What we found is that it is never too late to go back and fix mistakes that you make. So I will ask my colleagues at some point in the not too distant future, probably by unanimous consent, to pass the Emmett Till Civil Rights Crime Reauthorization Act of 2016. What this does differently than what the original piece of legislation did that Tom Coburn and Alvin Sykes hammered out is that it reauthorizes within the existing offices of the FBI and the Department of Justice and it more clearly delineates the responsibility of the deputy crime chief of the DOJ Civil Rights Division and provides for a joint task force for enhanced collaboration. It eliminates the pre-1970 date, and says that if the law was applied unequally, it doesn't matter when it was, and we should look at it. It eliminates the sunset provision on the Emmett Till law. This is a permanent piece of legislation, where the DOJ and FBI will consult with civil rights organizations, universities, and other entities to reach out and pull in potentially any other cases that should be reviewed. Of course, it allows for the Department of Justice to reopen certain cold cases that merit a second review as necessary, and it maintains the current funding levels. It is a very worthy bill to support. As much as I would really like to make my comments about Emmett Till, I can fill in a number of potentially different names. But the name I want to come to the floor to talk about is Alvin Sykes. Alvin Sykes is a self-taught civil rights advocate, a person who taught himself how to do these investigations into civil rights cases, a guy who is passionate about trying to bring justice to individuals who are no longer here. We are lobbied on Capitol Hill all the time by people who have an interest--it could be personal or it could be professional--in a particular issue. Alvin Sykes had nobody lobbying. They were dead. Alvin Sykes saw a potential injustice in our judicial system and spent a lifetime passionately pursuing how he as one individual could make this right. This is a tremendous success story about something that Congress has done that is good. What we need to do is extend the good work of Tom Coburn and, more importantly, the passion of Alvin Sykes to say that not only was this needed then but it is needed now and into the future. So I come to you today to give you a preview before this bill is presented and to thank my cosponsors, Senator Leahy, Senator McCaskill, and Senator Blunt, but more importantly, to thank Alvin Sykes. Without Alvin Sykes' passion and commitment, this injustice wouldn't have been brought to the attention of Tom Coburn, and Tom Coburn wouldn't have used his incredible passion to pass this bill originally. It is my hope that we can make not only Alvin Sykes proud of the work of the Senate but that, in a small way, it might send a message to those who are related to Emmett Till and to the hundreds of others who might have been served an injustice and so that their relatives can understand that they did have value and that value is for others--that they may not be exposed to an injustice in the future. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be part of the bicameral and bipartisan introduction for the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Reauthorization Act of 2016. There has been no stronger advocate on this bill than my friend, John Lewis, and I am proud to stand with him on this effort. In 2008, we passed this bill to strengthen the Federal Government's ability to investigate and prosecute unsolved murders from the civil rights era. The bill expires in fiscal year 2017, but it is important that we reauthorize the bill prior to its expiration so that the Department of Justice can continue its work on these unsolved cases, uninterrupted. More than 60 years ago, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American teenager, was brutally murdered, but no one was ever punished for it. His death was a pivotal--and tragic--moment in the Civil Rights era, and it continues to serve as a reminder that too many families suffer from the unsolved murders of their loved ones during the civil rights era without receiving justice. The way to best serve these families is to provide our Federal Government with the tools it needs to investigate these unsolved crimes, and to hopefully, bring some sense of closure for these families. The bill we are introducing today does just that. Since the bill's passage in 2008, the Justice Department and others have been assisting families in their quest for justice in resolving these unsolved murders. Specifically, the Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project of Northeastern University and the Cold Case Justice Initiative at the Syracuse University College of Law have both served as invaluable resources and guides for these families. I thank them for their work on these cases, as well as their input in improving this bill. Besides reauthorizing the bill, we have made some changes to address the issues that the families and the organizations have raised. This bill will improve coordination between the various law enforcement branches and the organizations involved; increase transparency and accountability; and continue to resolve these cases without concern of the legislation sunsetting. I thank Congressman Lewis for his tireless work on behalf of the families of these victims of unsolved murders from the civil rights era. I also thank Senator McCaskill of Missouri, Senator Burr of North Carolina, and Senator Blunt of Missouri, who have joined us in introducing this bipartisan bill. I hope that Senators Burr and Blunt can convince the Republican Chairman to move this bill through the Judiciary Committee and Republican Leadership to give this bill a vote on the floor. The road to justice can be long and winding, but we must continue to do our part to help these families obtain justice and closure for their losses.

What this does differently than what the original piece of legislation did that Tom Coburn and Alvin Sykes hammered out is that it reauthorizes within the existing offices of the FBI and the Department of Justice and it more clearly delineates the responsibility of the deputy crime chief of the DOJ Civil Rights Division and provides for a joint task force for enhanced collaboration. It eliminates the pre-1970 date, and says that if the law was applied unequally, it doesn't matter when it was, and we should look at it. It eliminates the sunset provision on the Emmett Till law. This is a permanent piece of legislation, where the DOJ and FBI will consult with civil rights organizations, universities, and other entities to reach out and pull in potentially any other cases that should be reviewed. Of course, it allows for the Department of Justice to reopen certain cold cases that merit a second review as necessary, and it maintains the current funding levels. It is a very worthy bill to support. As much as I would really like to make my comments about Emmett Till, I can fill in a number of potentially different names. But the name I want to come to the floor to talk about is Alvin Sykes. Alvin Sykes is a self-taught civil rights advocate, a person who taught himself how to do these investigations into civil rights cases, a guy who is passionate about trying to bring justice to individuals who are no longer here. We are lobbied on Capitol Hill all the time by people who have an interest--it could be personal or it could be professional--in a particular issue. Alvin Sykes had nobody lobbying. They were dead. Alvin Sykes saw a potential injustice in our judicial system and spent a lifetime passionately pursuing how he as one individual could make this right. This is a tremendous success story about something that Congress has done that is good. What we need to do is extend the good work of Tom Coburn and, more importantly, the passion of Alvin Sykes to say that not only was this needed then but it is needed now and into the future. So I come to you today to give you a preview before this bill is presented and to thank my cosponsors, Senator Leahy, Senator McCaskill, and Senator Blunt, but more importantly, to thank Alvin Sykes. Without Alvin Sykes' passion and commitment, this injustice wouldn't have been brought to the attention of Tom Coburn, and Tom Coburn wouldn't have used his incredible passion to pass this bill originally. It is my hope that we can make not only Alvin Sykes proud of the work of the Senate but that, in a small way, it might send a message to those who are related to Emmett Till and to the hundreds of others who might have been served an injustice and so that their relatives can understand that they did have value and that value is for others--that they may not be exposed to an injustice in the future. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be part of the bicameral and bipartisan introduction for the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Reauthorization Act of 2016. There has been no stronger advocate on this bill than my friend, John Lewis, and I am proud to stand with him on this effort. In 2008, we passed this bill to strengthen the Federal Government's ability to investigate and prosecute unsolved murders from the civil rights era. The bill expires in fiscal year 2017, but it is important that we reauthorize the bill prior to its expiration so that the Department of Justice can continue its work on these unsolved cases, uninterrupted. More than 60 years ago, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American teenager, was brutally murdered, but no one was ever punished for it. His death was a pivotal--and tragic--moment in the Civil Rights era, and it continues to serve as a reminder that too many families suffer from the unsolved murders of their loved ones during the civil rights era without receiving justice. The way to best serve these families is to provide our Federal Government with the tools it needs to investigate these unsolved crimes, and to hopefully, bring some sense of closure for these families. The bill we are introducing today does just that. Since the bill's passage in 2008, the Justice Department and others have been assisting families in their quest for justice in resolving these unsolved murders. Specifically, the Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project of Northeastern University and the Cold Case Justice Initiative at the Syracuse University College of Law have both served as invaluable resources and guides for these families. I thank them for their work on these cases, as well as their input in improving this bill. Besides reauthorizing the bill, we have made some changes to address the issues that the families and the organizations have raised. This bill will improve coordination between the various law enforcement branches and the organizations involved; increase transparency and accountability; and continue to resolve these cases without concern of the legislation sunsetting. I thank Congressman Lewis for his tireless work on behalf of the families of these victims of unsolved murders from the civil rights era. I also thank Senator McCaskill of Missouri, Senator Burr of North Carolina, and Senator Blunt of Missouri, who have joined us in introducing this bipartisan bill. I hope that Senators Burr and Blunt can convince the Republican Chairman to move this bill through the Judiciary Committee and Republican Leadership to give this bill a vote on the floor. The road to justice can be long and winding, but we must continue to do our part to help these families obtain justice and closure for their losses.

[[page s2461]] to give a little bit of history for my colleagues on this, this really stems from 1955, and it was the summer of 1955 when a young 14- year-old left chicago, il, and traveled to mississippi to visit relatives. while on that trip, he made a grave mistake. he whistled at a white woman. because of that, emmett till was killed. the investigation that resulted from his death culminated in a 67-minute deliberation by a jury that found both men and acquitted them. both individuals, roy bryant and j.w. milam confessed to the murder in 1956. in our criminal justice system, when you are found not guilty, you can't be retried. there was an injustice that was done. in this particular case, the injustice was done to emmett till, a 14-year-old. without an understanding of how many people might have been affected by the same lack of justice applied equally, there was a self-taught individual that became an activist. his name was alvin sykes. alvin sykes became a civil rights advocate. he was a cold case researcher. through the frustration of trying to get a bill to the u.s. senate that my good friend tom coburn held up, alvin sykes did what most people don't do in this town. rather than hold a press conference to talk about a civil rights bill, he called tom coburn and said: i would like to see you. he sat down with tom coburn, and tom said: what is it you are trying to do? the two bonded at that point, and they rewrote the bill to reflect what tom felt was the right legislative approach to create in this country--and fund, i might add--an effort to look back at all potential civil rights cases that were pre-1969. since the bill's passage, i think in 2008, the department of justice, along with the federal bureau of investigation, along with local law enforcement, has gone through 113 cases. i might add that 15 are still open, and in one they found a reason to convict an individual in the year 2010 from a case pre-1969. so let me say for my colleagues, we will introduce a bill to reauthorize this act. why? very simply, because just last year, the cold case justice initiative at syracuse university identified 196 potential cases that weren't caught when the justice department and the fbi looked at their cold case files. now, when senator coburn and alvin sykes put this legislation together, they funded the effort with a mere $13 million. with that $13 million, it created an effort within the justice department in the civil rights division and in the fbi. what we found is that it is never too late to go back and fix mistakes that you make. so i will ask my colleagues at some point in the not too distant future, probably by unanimous consent, to pass the emmett till civil rights crime reauthorization act of 2016. what this does differently than what the original piece of legislation did that tom coburn and alvin sykes hammered out is that it reauthorizes within the existing offices of the fbi and the department of justice and it more clearly delineates the responsibility of the deputy crime chief of the doj civil rights division and provides for a joint task force for enhanced collaboration. it eliminates the

DEREK KILMER of washington in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy of a friend, mentor, and dedicated public servant who changed the community of Bremerton for the better: Carol Arends. As the longest serving woman on Bremerton's City Council, Mrs. Arends guided Bremerton's downtown revitalization and was instrumental to breaking down barriers for women seeking local public office. Mrs. Arends' career path is a testament to her capabilities, innate knack for problem solving, and lifelong commitment to serving the public. Growing up in Tenino, Washington, Carol graduated second in her high school class and entered college to study business. She then embarked on a career at the Department of Natural Resources before relocating to Bremerton, Washington with her husband, John. Carol came to Bremerton ready to pull her sleeves up and get to work, and it wasn't long before she was an invaluable member of the community and serving the City of Bremerton on a number of advisory committees. Mrs. Arends' determination and vision for the city is ultimately what led to her recruitment in 1997 to run for Bremerton City Council. After her successful bid, Carol went on to serve four terms on the Bremerton City Council, including three years as council president. One doesn't have to look far to see the fruits of Mrs. Arends' labor. During her tenure as Councilmember, the City of Bremerton saw the approval of the Kitsap Conference Center, Harborside Fountain Park, a public safety bond, and a transit tunnel to better connect Washington State Ferries to our community. What Carol knew was that great leadership is the capacity to translate vision to reality. And with her guidance, she empowered us all to be part of that reality. Mr. Speaker, I have been encouraged by Mrs. Arends' leadership and I am honored to have considered her a partner and a friend. During good times and during her battle with illness, she was always there with a smile, a quip, and a desire to keep at it. Our community is stronger and more vibrant thanks to her thoughtful leadership and I am honored to recognize Carol Arends today in the United States Congress. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E581] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING CAROL ARENDS ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, It is my honor to recognize Mrs. Karen Hoover on the occasion of her departure as 2015-2016 Department President for the VFW Auxiliary Department of Pennsylvania. Spanning 31 years, Karen's countless contributions in my district and state reflect her dignity, honor, and dedication to improving her community and the lives of all Veterans of Foreign Wars. Karen joined the VFW Auxiliary in 1985, under the eligibility of her father, who served in the Army during WWII, and subsequently became a life member in 1999. She was elected the Auxiliary President in 1988 and served a total of eight terms. Since 2000, Karen has served as a Senior Vice President, Junior Vice President, Secretary, and in her current role as Treasurer. Auxiliary chairmanship positions she has occupied include Americanism, Membership, Cancer, and Safety. Karen has also acted as the District 18 Chief of Staff, Color Bearer, Extensions Chairman, and Treasurer for the Voice of Democracy program. Beyond her formal positions in the VFW, Karen has always understood the value of community engagement. She is a member of Saint Paul's Lutheran Church, the American Legion, Women of the Moose, Relay for Life Team, United Way Fundraising, and Valley Lanes Bowling League. Karen is a lifetime member of the National Home for Veterans Children and was a life member of the Scotland School for Veterans' Children until its closure in 2009. Additionally, Karen is a dedicated supporter of the Halifax Cat Rescue Association. Whether volunteering at the food stand during the Shippensburg Community Fair or spending valuable time with her family, Karen embodies the values and principles that are essential to the functioning of a productive community. Her departure will be accompanied by quality time with her daughter Nicole, who is also an active member of the Auxiliary, her two stepsons, and three grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize Mrs. Karen Hoover for her tireless dedication and excellence serving as 2015-2016 Department President for the VFW Auxiliary Department of Pennsylvania.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the Josephine Street community in Berryville, Virginia, has been officially designated a place of national historical significance and that the story of this proud African-American community has now been permanently included in the history of the Commonwealth of Virginia and of our nation. On February 9, 2015, as the newly elected member of Congress representing the Northern Shenandoah Valley, I submitted a letter enthusiastically endorsing the community's application to the Virginia Department of Historic Resources and the National Park Service, to be placed on the state and national registers of historic places, and within months I received word that both designations had been granted. What an incredibly inspiring place the Josephine Street community has been since its establishment in 1870, when the 24 founders--former slaves and free blacks--purchased 31 one-acre lots from the Clermont Farm property owned by Ellen McCormick and turned the land on either side of the mile-long street into a thriving community. In June of 2014, I was privileged to have been a part of an extraordinary walking tour of the community and will never forget the wonderful presentations by the elders of the community such as Viola Brown and Geneva Jackson. During this walking tour, I learned that the history of ``Josephine City'' is the story of a proud, resilient and resourceful people who, despite the ongoing negative effects of slavery and adversity of segregation, used their own talents, energies, and good will to build a remarkably self-sufficient and caring community that thrives to this day. Through the amazing energy and positive attitude of those early residents, a community had been created by the early 20th century that included a grade school and a high school, two churches, two public wells, two restaurants, stables, boarding houses (including one for teachers), a barber shop and gas station, a hat shop, a slaughterhouse, a clubhouse and a baseball team. I want to thank the many committed people who have been involved in obtaining this important historical designation, including Ms. Dee Dee Liggins, Reverend James Page, Jr. and Mr. Kenny Liggins of the Josephine Improvement Association; the leaders of the Josephine School Community Museum, including Dorothy Davis, Helen Carr, and Norma Johnson; the elected officials of Clarke County and Berryville; the Board of Directors of the Clarke County Historic Preservation Commission; and especially, Maral Kalbian, the architectural historian of Clarke County. All of these individuals and organizations have helped to ensure that future generations of Virginians and Americans will be inspired by the hard work and indomitable spirit of the residents of Josephine City who, despite adversity, created a thriving, caring, self-sufficient community that is a model for us all. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E582] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE PLACEMENT OF ``JOSEPHINE CITY'' IN BERRYVILLE, VIRGINIA ON THE NATIONAL AND STATE REGISTERS OF HISTORIC PLACES ______ HON.

GONZALEZ,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E583] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING CONGRESSMAN HENRY B. GONZALEZ ______ HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Congressman Henry B. Gonzalez, a treasured son of San Antonio and legendary Latino leader. May 3 of this year marks the 100th anniversary of Congressman Gonzalez's birth, a milestone I look forward to celebrating with his family and the broader San Antonio community. From an early age, Gonzalez took an interest in academics. He was an avid reader, and a graduate of Jefferson High School, San Antonio College, and St. Mary's University Law School. After graduating law school, Gonzalez dedicated his talents to helping his city and its residents. He served as Bexar County Chief Juvenile Probation Officer and worked for the San Antonio Public Housing Authority. In 1953, with a broad base of support, Gonzalez was elected to the San Antonio City Council where he served as mayor pro-tem for part of his first term. He was a courageous fighter for justice, leading the successful effort to desegregate all city facilities, protecting residents from undue utilities rate increases, and inspiring his peers. Some of Gonzalez's most notable stands against injustice occurred during his 1956-1961 tenure in the State Senate. He led the longest filibuster in the history of the Texas Legislature, speaking out against 10 racial segregation bills for 22 hours. Later, he filibustered for 20 hours against a bill seeking to circumvent the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education ruling against segregated schools. Gonzalez's legislation reflected his commitment to the people of San Antonio. He sponsored bills for a state minimum wage, for the establishment of a medical school in San Antonio, for the creation of a domestic relations court for Bexar County, and for authorizing urban renewal in our city. Gonzalez was not just a principled state legislator, he was a prolific one too. A total of 42 of the bills he sponsored, cosponsored, or handled in the Texas Senate became law. Following his time in the state legislature, Gonzalez went on to become the first Hispanic representative from Texas to serve in the United States Congress. For a remarkable 37 years, he was the voice of San Antonians in Washington. His ``20th Century Program for the 20th District'' helped markedly improve life for folks in our city. Gonzalez's tireless efforts bolstered our local universities, supported small businesses, and grew our military installations, bringing thousands of new jobs to San Antonio. He fought poverty, spearheaded projects like HemisFair that spurred our city's tourism industry, expanded San Antonio kids' access to early education, and stood up for our veterans, particularly with the construction of Audie Murphy Veterans Hospital. More broadly, Gonzalez supported and contributed to landmark legislation that fundamentally changed our nation for the better, including the Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Equal Opportunities Act. Beyond his work in legislative chambers, Gonzalez took care to connect personally with his constituents. He kept the people of San Antonio well-informed of his work, and he made sure each individual's problem received the time and attention needed to be resolved. In a touching tribute to the dedication Gonzalez showed his city throughout his career, the people of San Antonio lined the streets to view his funeral procession and pay their respects after his death in 2000. Henry B. Gonzalez's legacy has been a guiding light throughout my career, and it is an honor to serve in the seat he once filled as the current representative for Texas' 20th District. I offer my best wishes to his family and to the entire San Antonio community as we take time on this anniversary to celebrate his illustrious life. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E583] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING CONGRESSMAN HENRY B.

For the past 29 years we have relied on his bold leadership, thoughtful vision and unquestioned commitment to higher education--and while professionally he will certainly be missed, Dr. Church's legacy and more so friendship will remain a part of the fabric of our community forever. Though Dr. Church refuses to take credit for much, his work ethic and sense of service began at an early age and was found in an unassuming place, far from academia. ``I milked cows morning and night for the first 18 years of my life'', Dr. Church once said. He was the youngest of six children growing up on a 230-acre dairy farm south of Syracuse, N.Y. He attended college not far from there, graduating from State University of New York at Cortland and it was here where Dr. Church began his 45 year commitment to higher education. Not long after Dr. Church received his Master's Degree in education from St. Joseph College of Florida, where he taught health sciences, he was given opportunity to become the dean of students at only 25 years of age. Soon after pursuing a doctorate in higher education administration from Florida Atlantic University, Dr. Church's meteoric rise through the world of higher education continued. From dean of academic affairs at Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale to vice president and chief academic officer of St. Petersburg College and eventually and thankfully landing him in Lorain County, Ohio as the fifth President of our community's college, in 1987. Back then, LCCC was a straight-forward, conventional community college of 5,000 students, offering associate degrees in basic coursework, in a few disciplines. Today, it is one of the top schools of its kind in the country and is a leader in innovation, entrepreneurship, and higher education. It didn't take long for Dr. Church to see the connection between a higher education and good jobs, understanding the need to not only prepare and train students for their future, but to also help foster entrepreneurship that create good- paying jobs. It was through Dr. Church's vision and leadership that LCCC helped launch innovative and ground breaking initiatives such as the nationally recognized University Partnership Program, that provides four-year and graduate degree programs from local universities or Early College that allows for high school students to earn college credit. Other creative initiatives include the Innovation Alliance, an effort to improve access to science, technology, engineering and math degrees and GLIDE (the Great Lakes Innovation and Development Enterprise), the county's [[Page E584]] technology incubator, which to date has awarded more than $28 million to 44 companies, the FabLab, an innovative ``makerspace'' and the SMART Center for Microsystems and sensor technology. Since Dr. Church's time at LCCC, its transformation is and has been ahead of its time. In President Obama's last visit to LCCC--he visited the college twice--he spoke of the need for community colleges to become community career centers, so people who are looking for a new job or a better-paying job can learn the skills that businesses need right now. That is what Dr. Church has done: he has helped create and lead one of the nation's premiere institutions, always with a root and focus on the student and academics, but mindful of its true role and responsibility. ``As the community's college, we serve all . . . students, companies, organizations, residents,'' Dr. Church once said. ``We are a resource for the entire community.'' It is difficult to estimate how many lives Dr. Church has touched-- how many single mothers relying on an affordable education to provide a better life for their children--how many laid-off steelworkers who were retrained to once again have an opportunity to work--how many companies and business startups that created new and good-paying jobs--how many first generation college students were given the opportunity to climb out of poverty? Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor and pleasure today, to pay tribute to a visionary leader and community partner, Dr. Roy Church, and join the tens of thousands who thank him for his service and commitment to our community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E583-E584] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE OCCASION OF THE RETIREMENT OF DR.

CREC-2016-04-26-pt1-PgE584-3,CREC-2016-04-26,114,HONORING MOUND BAYOU PUBLIC SCHOOLS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E584-E585] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MOUND BAYOU PUBLIC SCHOOLS ______ HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable educational institution, the Mound Bayou Public School District in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. The early settlers in Mound Bayou recognized the value of education in building a community. Early in 1888, I.T. Montgomery and his sister, Virginia Montgomery, began holding classes for children in his home. This school developed into the Mound Bayou Public School. Ms. Montgomery, the first principal, served until 1896. During the early years school was held in the first church, Green Grove, now First Baptist. Rev. J.L. Brandfort succeeded Virginia Montgomery as principal. As joint principals Professor R.J. Jarrett continued the school in Green Grove, while Professor James Wilson held classes in Bethel A.M.E. Church. Mrs. Gertrude Jones Bryant became the principal in 1904 and served until 1915. A local Board of Trustees ran the school, but it was responsible to a county board that was not so willing to appropriate money for the school, even though this school had an enrollment of 200 by 1910. In 1892, Montgomery and Green donated a tract of land for educational purposes, ``designed to supplement the inadequate curriculum of the public schools''. The Mound Bayou Normal and Industrial Institute was built on this tract of land, with the assistance of the American Missionary Association. The school was largely supported by tuition but continued to receive some financial assistance from the American Missionary Association, which was responsible for providing the first principal and teacher, Mrs. Annie Randolph. The second principal was Miss Mary E. Crump, who was succeeded by Miss Minnie S. Washington. A complete high school course was added under the leadership of Professor B.F. Ousley. Vocational instruction in music and domestic arts and science was offered. Professor Ousley served as principal for a period of 16 years. Upon his resignation, Professor F.M. Roberts became principal and was assisted by Professor Robert Ross. In 1912, while working with Booker T. Washington, Montgomery and Charles Bank secured a $1000 donation from Julius Rosenwald to build a school. Andrew Carnegie was persuaded to donate $4000 for the construction of a library. Booker T. Washington said that Mound Bayou was ``not merely a town, but at the same time and in a very real sense of the word, a school. It is not only a place where a Negro may get inspiration . . . but a place, also, where he has the opportunity to learn some of the fundamental duties and responsibilities of social and civic life.'' In 1920 all of the public schools in the vicinity of Mound Bayou and the Mound Bayou Normal and Industrial Institute consolidated to form the Mound Bayou Consolidated Public School and County Training School. A local Board of Trustees administered the school with responsibility to the County Superintendent of Education. The members of the first Board were I.T. Montgomery, Chairman, B.W. Bryan and John W. Francis. The second Board included B.A. Green, Chairman, D.J. Hill, T.S. Morris, John Tharpe, Sr., Rev. Jim Jones, and P.M. Smith. The three-story brick structure was completed and the first classes started in 1921. It was located in Mound Bayou on about four acres of land. It served an area of thirty square miles with 16 classrooms and an auditorium with a seating capacity of 700. The average annual enrollment was 850. Classes were held nine months a year. This building served all the students of Mound Bayou and the surrounding vicinities until 1960, when I.T. Montgomery Elementary School was erected. The three-story brick building, Mound Bayou High School, was closed in the fall of 1964, when a new building, John F. Kennedy Memorial High School, was opened. Principals who served the Bolivar County Training School were J.H. Moseley, J.H. Powell, A.R. Taylor, C.M. Green, Mrs. Olevia Holmes- Ryles, Richard Williams, Mrs. Richard Williams, Rev. Hardin, and B.T. Johnson. B.T. Johnson was the last administrator designated as a principal for the Bolivar County Training School. Mr. Calvin J. Jones was selected as the first superintendent of Bolivar County School District Number Six, following a county reorganization, after the 1954 Supreme Court decision overruling the practice of segregation in public schools.

BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable educational institution, the Mound Bayou Public School District in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. The early settlers in Mound Bayou recognized the value of education in building a community. Early in 1888, I.T. Montgomery and his sister, Virginia Montgomery, began holding classes for children in his home. This school developed into the Mound Bayou Public School. Ms. Montgomery, the first principal, served until 1896. During the early years school was held in the first church, Green Grove, now First Baptist. Rev. J.L. Brandfort succeeded Virginia Montgomery as principal. As joint principals Professor R.J. Jarrett continued the school in Green Grove, while Professor James Wilson held classes in Bethel A.M.E. Church. Mrs. Gertrude Jones Bryant became the principal in 1904 and served until 1915. A local Board of Trustees ran the school, but it was responsible to a county board that was not so willing to appropriate money for the school, even though this school had an enrollment of 200 by 1910. In 1892, Montgomery and Green donated a tract of land for educational purposes, ``designed to supplement the inadequate curriculum of the public schools''. The Mound Bayou Normal and Industrial Institute was built on this tract of land, with the assistance of the American Missionary Association. The school was largely supported by tuition but continued to receive some financial assistance from the American Missionary Association, which was responsible for providing the first principal and teacher, Mrs. Annie Randolph.

The original members of this church first worshipped as a part of a white congregation at Mount Pleasant Church. As they desired to form a church of their own, a committee of black members was formed. The church held its first services in a one room log cabin which also served as a school. The present building was constructed in 1874. Over the last one hundred and fifty years, the church has grown physically with additions and upgrades of the buildings. Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church has been pastored by many fine ministers, starting with Rev. Peter Johnson in 1867 and leading to today's pastor, Rev. Reginald C. Davis. Many lives have been changed by the ministry of the pastors and the members of this church. Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church has been called one of the best rural churches in Kentucky.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the achievements and the 50th anniversary of the Prince William County Department of Fire and Rescue. In January of 1966, Prince William County hired its first paid firefighter, Phil Ponder. Ponder was the first of what is now over 600 Fire & Rescue personnel. Prince William County holds a number of records such as the first jurisdiction on the east coast to implement a 911 system and the first jurisdiction in the state and national capital region to implement a physical agility exam for career firefighters. In addition to those achievements, the department hired the first female fire chief of a metropolitan-sized department. I had the pleasure of meeting with Prince William County Department of Fire and Rescue Chief Kevin McGee recently where we talked about how the Department has evolved. Chief McGee always challenges his team to be on the cutting edge of firefighting and emergency rescue. Time and again Prince William County Fire and Rescue personnel have used their skills not only to help the people of Prince William County but also the citizens of Northern Virginia and beyond at their time in need. Over the years, Prince William County Fire and Rescue has assisted with incidents like the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon and with rescue efforts following Hurricane Katrina. Today, the department has 555 uniformed and 60 civilian staff providing service around the clock. It is one of three jurisdictions in the Commonwealth with a delegated training authority for the Virginia Department of Fire Programs and is a partner in the National Capital Region Incident Management Team. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to acknowledge the achievements of the Prince William County Department of Fire and Rescue over the last 50 years and thank all of the staff, both past and present, for protecting the lives and property of the region. I offer sincere gratitude for their service to the community, the Commonwealth, and the nation over the past 50 years and know that high quality service will be engrained in the Prince William County Department of Fire and Rescue for generations to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E585] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF FIRE AND RESCUE ______ HON.

WILLIAMS ______ HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Earle C. Williams of McLean, Virginia. Earle was a Northern Virginia business, technology, philanthropic, and community leader and friend to so many throughout the Commonwealth. I am so honored to have known Earle as a friend and valued advisor. He was an insightful and gifted leader who accomplished so much and gave so much back to his community. Earle was chairman of the Naval Research Advisory Committee, the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority, and was a permanent director and past international chairman of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association. Earle began his storied career a leader in the Washington, D.C. area and was a man who truly cared for his employees and all those around him. He was someone who believes in a strong culture of education and the arts and worked tirelessly to promote these endeavors in his life. His career as President and CEO of BDM International lasted from 1972 to 1992, during which he founded both the Professional Services Council and the Northern Virginia Technology Council. These organizations have since become major fixtures in the Northern Virginia region and Earle's work with them will forever impact our community. The Northern Virginia Technology Council appropriately named its annual lifetime achievement award, `The Earle C. Williams Lifetime Achievement Award' and it is given to a person whose lifetime personal and professional endeavors have made a significant impact on the Northern Virginia technology community. His professional accomplishments were many and celebrated and he did it all with his wife and family always surrounding him and celebrating with him and giving back with him. He passed away peacefully, blessed with his dear wife, June, by his side. She and her daughters and family had been faithfully keeping vigil the final several weeks and never left his side. Earle also worked extensively with Wolf Trap in Vienna, always valuing a culture of innovation as key to success in the arts. In 2015, he received the Jinx Hazel Arts Award for leadership and advocacy in the arts for his work with Wolf Trap and continued to work through the rest of his life to improve Wolf Trap so our entire community can benefit. In 1994, Earle was inducted into the Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame and from 1991 to 2004 was a part of the Auburn University Foundation Board, serving as its chairman the final two years. Earle's work ethic and passion for helping those around him was unrivaled, and was shown in his continued service to the community. He will always be a role model not just to me, but to those in his community, his wife June, his three daughters Carol, Sharon, and Gayle, and his seven grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I hope everyone joins me in honoring the life of Earle C. Williams. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E587] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF EARLE C.

WILLIAMS ______ HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Earle C. Williams of McLean, Virginia. Earle was a Northern Virginia business, technology, philanthropic, and community leader and friend to so many throughout the Commonwealth. I am so honored to have known Earle as a friend and valued advisor. He was an insightful and gifted leader who accomplished so much and gave so much back to his community. Earle was chairman of the Naval Research Advisory Committee, the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority, and was a permanent director and past international chairman of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association. Earle began his storied career a leader in the Washington, D.C. area and was a man who truly cared for his employees and all those around him. He was someone who believes in a strong culture of education and the arts and worked tirelessly to promote these endeavors in his life. His career as President and CEO of BDM International lasted from 1972 to 1992, during which he founded both the Professional Services Council and the Northern Virginia Technology Council. These organizations have since become major fixtures in the Northern Virginia region and Earle's work with them will forever impact our community. The Northern Virginia Technology Council appropriately named its annual lifetime achievement award, `The Earle C. Williams Lifetime Achievement Award' and it is given to a person whose lifetime personal and professional endeavors have made a significant impact on the Northern Virginia technology community. His professional accomplishments were many and celebrated and he did it all with his wife and family always surrounding him and celebrating with him and giving back with him. He passed away peacefully, blessed with his dear wife, June, by his side. She and her daughters and family had been faithfully keeping vigil the final several weeks and never left his side. Earle also worked extensively with Wolf Trap in Vienna, always valuing a culture of innovation as key to success in the arts. In 2015, he received the Jinx Hazel Arts Award for leadership and advocacy in the arts for his work with Wolf Trap and continued to work through the rest of his life to improve Wolf Trap so our entire community can benefit. In 1994, Earle was inducted into the Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame and from 1991 to 2004 was a part of the Auburn University Foundation Board, serving as its chairman the final two years.

JOHN J. DUNCAN, JR. of tennessee in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I wish to honor a man whose service to his community and commitment to the lives of many young men has brought great distinction to East Tennessee and this Nation. Mr. Jim Braden was originally a resident of Ripley, West Virginia, before finding permanent roots in East Tennessee's City of Farragut where I am glad he stayed. Jim Braden has devoted fifty-two years of his incredible life to coaching baseball as an unpaid volunteer. His impact on the Farragut community can be seen through organizing and implementing the countywide Knox County Middle School Baseball League and raising funds for facilities that support Farragut baseball. Coach Braden worked with young men who would later go on to be team members of college, minor and major league teams. Mr. Braden has worn many hats in life on top of his baseball cap. He bravely served our Country during Vietnam War as a member of a United States Navy helicopter squadron. He is the husband of Catherine who contributed to the success of Knox County and Farragut athletics. He is the father of two Farragut High School Alumni, Mark and Laura. He is the legend that the Farragut High School Dugout Club will name an award after. The Farragut High School Dugout Club recognizes an outstanding player each season by recognizing them with a ``Mr. Baseball'' award. On the occasion of the name of this award being changed to the ``Coach Jim Braden Mr. Baseball Award'' I call to the attention of my colleagues and other readers to celebrate his contribution to countless lives on and off the baseball field. Coach Braden looks forward to passing along the love of the game to his grandchildren while instilling the importance of community involvement. He is a shining example of a true Tennessee Volunteer. I hope you will join me in celebrating his life and legacy. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E587] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JIM BRADEN ______ HON.

Johnson and his wife, First Lady Betty Johnson as they celebrate their Diamond Anniversary of sixty years in pastoral service. The congregation of St. Mark's Missionary Baptist Church in Toledo, Ohio celebrates the milestone this month. Incredibly, I stood in this chamber ten years ago to recognize Pastor and First Lady Johnson's fiftieth jubilee. As I noted then, born in Troy Alabama, one of eleven children of Mary and Levi Johnson, ``Reverend Johnson entered the ministry at age twelve. By nineteen, he began pastoring in his home state of Alabama. He received his Bachelor of Theology degree from Easonian Baptist Seminary in Birmingham Alabama, and served four churches until coming to Ohio in 1955. In July of that year, he was invited by Dr. Israel Walker to conduct a revival at St. Mary's Baptist Church. During this visit he met the woman who would become his wife. On August 26, 1958, Reverend Johnson and Mother Betty Rae Johnson were married. Together they raised four children: Reverend C.L. Johnson, Reverend Michael Johnson, Denisee Williams and Angela Taylor. In October of 1955, Pastor Johnson founded and organized St. Mark's Missionary Baptist Church. Started with just three members, the church grew over the half-century to more than 2,000 souls.'' Pastor Johnson is a man devoted to the Gospel. In addition to his spiritual leadership at St. Mark's, Reverend Roberts has conducted revivals throughout the Eastern half of the United States. Many have been called to Christ through him and he has given wise counsel to countless people. His legacy continues through his sons, both called to preach in their own right. A leader in our community as well, Pastor Johnson has served the Baptist Ministers Conference, the Fairside Community Organization, [[Page E588]] Northwestern Ohio Missionary Baptist Association, Lucas County Mental Health Board, Interracial Interfaith Committee, Evangelical Board of the National Baptist Convention, and NAACP. A beloved father, grandfather, great-grandfather, friend and mentor, Reverend Johnson has been a guiding light in our community for generations. Always alongside him, First Lady Johnson has been a nurturing mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, friend and confidant. Their union is a dynamic partnership which has been a beautiful example to all. Together, Pastor and First Lady Johnson have turned hearts toward Jesus Christ and his message of Love. They exemplify the words of Thessalonians 1:3, ``We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.'' The congregation of St. Mark's, their family and our community celebrate Rev. I.J. and Mrs. Betty Johnson in their life's work. We congratulate you, reminisce with you, and look toward the future together. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E587-E588] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 60TH PASTORAL ANNIVERSARY OF REVEREND & MRS.

Incredibly, I stood in this chamber ten years ago to recognize Pastor and First Lady Johnson's fiftieth jubilee. As I noted then, born in Troy Alabama, one of eleven children of Mary and Levi Johnson, ``Reverend Johnson entered the ministry at age twelve. By nineteen, he began pastoring in his home state of Alabama. He received his Bachelor of Theology degree from Easonian Baptist Seminary in Birmingham Alabama, and served four churches until coming to Ohio in 1955. In July of that year, he was invited by Dr. Israel Walker to conduct a revival at St. Mary's Baptist Church. During this visit he met the woman who would become his wife. On August 26, 1958, Reverend Johnson and Mother Betty Rae Johnson were married. Together they raised four children: Reverend C.L. Johnson, Reverend Michael Johnson, Denisee Williams and Angela Taylor. In October of 1955, Pastor Johnson founded and organized St. Mark's Missionary Baptist Church. Started with just three members, the church grew over the half-century to more than 2,000 souls.'' Pastor Johnson is a man devoted to the Gospel. In addition to his spiritual leadership at St. Mark's, Reverend Roberts has conducted revivals throughout the Eastern half of the United States. Many have been called to Christ through him and he has given wise counsel to countless people. His legacy continues through his sons, both called to preach in their own right. A leader in our community as well, Pastor Johnson has served the Baptist Ministers Conference, the Fairside Community Organization, [[Page E588]] Northwestern Ohio Missionary Baptist Association, Lucas County Mental Health Board, Interracial Interfaith Committee, Evangelical Board of the National Baptist Convention, and NAACP. A beloved father, grandfather, great-grandfather, friend and mentor, Reverend Johnson has been a guiding light in our community for generations. Always alongside him, First Lady Johnson has been a nurturing mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, friend and confidant. Their union is a dynamic partnership which has been a beautiful example to all. Together, Pastor and First Lady Johnson have turned hearts toward Jesus Christ and his message of Love. They exemplify the words of Thessalonians 1:3, ``We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.'' The congregation of St. Mark's, their family and our community celebrate Rev. I.J. and Mrs. Betty Johnson in their life's work.

As the Senior, APA Republican in Congress, I want to take this opportunity to celebrate Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month. I could not be more proud of the influence and contributions of those who came before me. It is their memory and sacrifices that drive me while performing my duties as the Member of Congress who represents American Samoa and I look forward to continuing the important work that they began.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a self-motivated leader and innovator of the community, Mr. Melvin Lee Loper, who was born on March 16, 1920 in Finkbine, Mississippi, which is no longer on the map. It was a logging camp for the loggers which was his father's occupation. His parents, the late Marshall and Mamie Loper, later moved to Raymond, Mississippi where they worked as sharecroppers. His only sibling was a younger brother, Otis Loper, who is now deceased. In those days, rural schools did not go further than 8th grade. He lived with a cousin in Jackson, Mississippi to attend high school, and graduated from Lanier High School in 1939. He entered Tougaloo College but was drafted in the United States Army in World War II. He served for four years with a tour of duty in Europe. He returned to Tougaloo College and completed his studies in 1948 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. In 1973, he received a Master's Degree in Administration from Jackson College, after many years of attending summer school and taking classes on Saturdays. That was the way of life to further your education back in the day. He began his teaching career in Smith county; later Sumner Hill High School and Jackson Public Schools. After thirty-three years of teaching he retired in 1985. He continued teaching several years after retirement because Mathematics teachers were always in demand. He has been an active member of Farish Street Baptist Church for 55 years. He served as: Sunday School teacher, a Member of the Boy Scout Committee, and attended Wednesday night Bible Study faithfully until his recent illness. He has been in the choir for fifty years, and served as Church Treasurer for thirty-three years. He was an original member of the Jackson Tougaloo Alumni Club, organized by the late Mrs. Thelma Sanders forty-four years ago. He was serving as President when the club sponsored the Broadway play, ``Aint Misbehavin'' which was a great success. He worked for years with the committee sponsoring the Ebony Fashion Show. He is a loyal supporter of Tougaloo College with his funds and presence, when able. He is married to Gwendolyn Nero Loper and they have three children: Rodney, Larry and Gerrilyn; ten grandchildren and eleven great- grandchildren. His secret to longevity is hard work, attending to your business, being an avid sports fan, and marrying a good cook.

Putin's interventionist policies that seek to reestablish the Russian Federation as a world power have incited chaos and conflict along NATO's southern flank. Post-Soviet states once free from the yoke of oppression have been thrust back into civil and economic instability by Russian policies designed to sow discord and distrust along NATO's vulnerable underbelly. Moscow's invasion of Georgia set in motion what has become an increasingly obvious pattern. Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and ongoing military campaign in the eastern parts of Ukraine have made it clear that Russia is openly proclaiming the redrawing of Europe's borders. Equally troubling, NATO members in Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe continue to face antagonism from Russia, including a substantial military [[Page E589]] buildup in Armenia where Putin has deployed advanced fighter aircraft and attack helicopters just 25 miles from the Turkish border. This is the same NATO border that Russian military aircraft have regularly violated, culminating in the downing of a Russian bomber by Turkish defense forces. I need not remind this House that Turkey is an indispensable ally in the fight against ISIL, and the effort to restore stability in the Middle East. Unnecessary Russian provocations such as this increase the risk of miscalculation and escalation between nuclear powers, and are intended to drive a wedge between NATO allies. Just last week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg made a symbolic trip to Washington, D.C. where he met with the President and members of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees to discuss the threats posed by an increasingly assertive Russia. I myself moderated a NATO Parliamentary Assembly Panel, where our partners from around the world raised concerns about a resurgent Russia, and whether the United States will continue to play its indispensable role in ensuring a stable world order. Mr. Speaker, on the bleached bones of great civilizations and nations are written the pathetic words: ``Too little, too late.'' Ladies and gentlemen, I call on Members of Congress to heed these words, and to stand undaunted in the face of Russian aggression before it is too late. Putin's escalating aggression in his efforts to project power is a direct threat to our NATO allies and U.S. interests abroad. We must stand with our NATO allies now, more than ever, to ensure that security in the region is maintained. We must pursue peace and diplomacy for the sake of future generations. That peace will only come through unified strength. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E588-E589] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONDEMNING RUSSIAN AGGRESSION ______ HON.

He was chosen to be a member of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, recognized today as the ``Ghost Army''. The Ghost Army's World War II operations consisted of deceiving German reconnaissance aircraft and radio interceptors by using only their creativity and a handful of props.

MARIO DIAZ-BALART of florida in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three Naples men who have traveled 1,256 miles by bicycle from Naples, FL to Washington, DC to raise awareness for Gentle'men Against Domestic Violence (GADV), an initiative of The Shelter for Abused Women and Children in Naples, FL. GADV calls on men to stand as equal partners with women to end domestic violence. GADV seeks to prevent the generational cycle of abuse through prevention programs such as Raising Gentle'men, a school-based curriculum, which teaches boys and young men that strength does not equal violence and true gentle'men exhibit the traits of respect, loyalty, honesty and accountability. GADV dispels myths of masculinity as based on aggression, and is working toward a cultural shift that will eliminate domestic violence. GADV is associated with The Shelter for Abused Women and Children in Naples, which does excellent work as well. The shelter not only operates as a haven for survivors of domestic violence, but performs outreach and operates prevention programs in the community. The work that the shelter does has touched countless lives, strengthened the community, and drawn praise from various sectors of the South Florida community, including schools, police officers, and those involved with the judicial system. According to the National Council Against Domestic Violence, one in four women have been victims of some form of physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. Numbers like that are far too high. We have a responsibility to continue to create policy that prevents, protects and prevails over domestic violence. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Colin Estrem, Gordon Kellam and Glen Schwesinger for their mission to raise awareness for the Gentle'men Against Domestic Violence program and The Shelter for Abused Women and Children in Naples, and I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this worthy cause. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E590] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING GENTLE'MEN AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE SHELTER FOR ABUSED WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN NAPLES ______ HON.

As a residential facility in Central Florida that provides a home and education for boys and girls in troubled family circumstances, the Edgewood Children's Ranch has made a remarkable impression on the lives of the young people who have been under their care. The vision for the Edgewood Children's Ranch began in 1966 when Juvenile Court Judge D. Arthur Yergey identified the need for a residential home where boys could be placed after displaying negative social behaviors due to family situations. This realization led Judge Yergey into contact with John W. ``Jack'' Lynd, who subsequently opened the Edgewood Boys Ranch in Orlando, Florida. Today, 50 years later, the residents Edgewood Children's Ranch consist of both boys and girls ages 6-17, with a capacity for 70 children at a time.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate Earth Day, the day set aside to honor our planet and formerly renamed as International Mother Earth Day, in 2009 by the United Nations. For more than four decades, Earth Day has brought Americans together to honor our moral responsibility to preserve our planet, protect our environment, and address the pressing challenge of climate change. Across the country, families and students spend this day serving their communities, cleaning up their neighborhoods, promoting conservation, and participating in the effort to ensure clean air, clean water, and a cleaner planet. The first Earth Day was celebrated on April 22, 1970, originating in the United States, and becoming recognized worldwide by 1990. On the very first Earth Day, 46 years ago, 20 million people gathered in the streets of America to protest the environmental damage caused by industrialization and gave birth to the environmental movement. Every year on April 22, men, women, and children collect garbage, plant trees, clean up coral reefs, hold teach-ins, sign petitions, and plan for a better future for our planet. I commend the schools and communities celebrating Earth Day for a whole week to expand the time frame that people focus on the earth and how they can preserve it. On Earth Day 2012, more than 100,000 people rode bikes in China to reduce CO2 emissions and save fuel. In an Earth Day celebration in 2011, 28 million trees were planted in Afghanistan by the Earth Day Network. In Panama, 100 endangered species of orchids were planted and maintained to prevent their extinction in honor of Earth Day. This Earth Day we must take the opportunity to act to keep America number one in science, technology, and renewable energy. For Congress, Earth Day must be a moment to build on American efforts to invest in clean energy jobs, to strengthen industries of innovation, to decrease harmful emissions, to cut energy costs for consumers, and to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. This day must represent a clarion call to renew our commitment to defend our natural resources and reverse the ill effects of climate change. On Earth Day, Democrats and Republicans should commit to working side-by-side with the American people to create a future of sustainability for our children and grandchildren, prosperity and opportunity for our families and communities, and security and energy independence for generations to come. I urge all Members to join me in celebrating our planet and assuring a longer and healthier life for all creatures inhabiting her bountiful realm. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E590] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORTING EARTH DAY 2016 ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a church family whose desire is to do God's will, Calvary M. B. Church. Calvary M. B. Church has served the Yazoo County community over a century through faith and service. Calvary M. B. Church desire is to bring people closer to the Lord. They want to build the foundation of faith in young people and remind the Yazoo community that anything is possible through love, faith and prayer. Calvary, located on Broadway, began welcoming the community to its services over 100 years ago. November 15, 2015 will mark 131 years of praise, prayer and worship. On April 1, 1889 a small group purchased a lot for $50 which became the site of Calvary. For an additional $35, another lot was purchased along with the original and this site would later develop into the modern day church. According to church history notes the first pastor was Rev. Phillips. As the years progressed the congregation grew, even amidst growth, there were challenges. Small fires struck the church. Over the years several pastors called Calvary home. But it seemed like perfect timing when Pastor RaSean O. Thomas arrived at Calvary in 2009. Pastor Thomas is a product of Calvary. Calvary has a rich history within the Yazoo community, its recent ministries and growth show what can be done through strong prayer and fellowship. Currently, the church has two hundred members and growing. The church has Sunday School, morning worship every Sunday, Wednesday night Bible Study, monthly street evangelism and prayer services, outreach project health fairs, men and women empowerment conferences and other ministries. There is always something going on inside the walls of Calvary. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Calvary M. B. Church for its dedication to serving the community and doing God's will. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E590] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING CALVARY M.

CREC-2016-04-26-pt1-PgE590-4,CREC-2016-04-26,114,CELEBRATING THE 68TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E590-E591] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 68TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL ______ HON. E. SCOTT RIGELL of virginia in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. RIGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to submit a statement on behalf of my constituent, Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman. Rabbi Zoberman is the Founding Rabbi of Congregation Beth Chaverim in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Rabbi Zoberman asked me to submit the following remarks: As we celebrate the 68th Anniversary of the State of Israel, heir to the Jewish people's long and proud legacy of the spirit uplifting humanity, it remains an enlightened Western island of progressive values retaining its democratic essence in a wide sea of barbarism and backwardness begrudging the survival of the world's only Jewish state. In fact, no other democratic nation-state's very existence is questioned except Israel's. This is in spite of its enduring roots in its historic land, and world renowned accomplishments in the arts, sciences, and high- tech industries. It proved an unrivaled ability to rise from two millennia of exile, oppression, and an unparalleled Holocaust consuming a third of the Jewish people. Israel's renewed emergence against great odds is an affirmation of the transforming power of hope, and the rightful restoration of the Jewish people's human dignity and standing in the community of nations. It is the divine fulfillment of prophetic promise, with the challenging mandate and expectation to create a model society. Today's troubled Middle East, home of humanity's inspiring Biblical Exodus, is in dire need of replacing degradation with dignity, and unremitting terrorism with humane [[Page E591]] teachings. We remain mindful of the unabated genocidal Syrian tragedy of President Bashar Al-Assad's making with critical Iranian and Russian support. The recurrence of brutal Palestinian terrorism which constantly claims Israeli lives is cruelly rewarded by the Palestinian Authority's leadership. On numerous occasions, terrorists are honored as martyrs while they totally disregard human life. One of the many victims, 29 year old Taylor Force from Lubbock, Texas, a non-Jewish graduate student from Vanderbilt University, was knifed to death in Jaffa, close to where visiting Vice President and Mrs. Joseph Biden were dining at the time. Force, a graduate of West Point, served combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. When confronted with a tragic Jewish terrorist attack on the Palestinian Dawabsheh family, which claimed three lives, there was rightly shocked condemnation from all echelons of Israeli society. Will President Mahmoud Abbas fmally reach out to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's call for direct negotiations for a two- state solution to the festering conflict in a raging region, with a demilitarized Palestinian State and a recognition of its neighboring Jewish State? For the sake of all, let not the Palestinians miss this opportunity too. This past November 4, 2015, we observed the 20th Anniversary of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's watershed assassination. With its profound lessons, I reflected by reading this verse: ``Rest in peace, Guarded by the stones You liberated thrice- Twice in war And once in hope. Jerusalem is thy faithful Wall that won't breach, Friend of Shalom.'' Last February I attended the 127th Annual Convention of the Central Conference of American Rabbis (Reform), which meets in Israel every seven years, to attest to their abiding bond with the State of Israel. I joyfully participated in an egalitarian worship service at the Southern extension of the Western Wall which has been allotted for non-Orthodox Jewish practice. This compromised arrangement was government sanctioned, while hurdles unfortunately persist. Significant progress toward pluralistic religious Jewish expression has been made due to Israel's Supreme Court intervention. Much is at stake, acknowledging the courageous and tenacious struggle for acceptance by the Women of the Wall. There is, however, a fringe but dangerous Jewish group calling to replace Israel's democracy with a ``Judean Monarchy.'' It is a wonder that Israel, saddled with existential concerns that few other countries deal with, remains a shining exemplar of light and perseverance. The recent rescue, of 17 Jews, with American aid, including Rabbi Suleiman Bin Yaqoub, from war-torn Yemen, one of Jewry's most ancient communities, tells of the difference Israel makes. Surely its vital bond of shared values and common interests with the USA is an essential one for both democracies. I am particularly alarmed by Iran and its proxies, the deadly global reach of ISIS, the destructive Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, European anti-Semitism, and the United Nations' double standard against Israel. The poignant words of the late Prime Minister Golda Meir are revealing, ``We owe a responsibility not only to those who are in Israel but also to those generations that are no more, to those millions that have died within our lifetime, to Jews all over the world and generations of Jews to come. We hate war. We don't rejoice in victories. We rejoice when a new kind of cotton is grown and when strawberries bloom in Israel.'' I speak as a refugee born in Chu, Kazakhstan (USSR) in November 1945, to Polish Holocaust survivors. There I spent my early childhood in Displaced Persons Camps in Austria and Germany before moving to Israel in 1949. The current suffering of millions of refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere should move us all to caring action with caution, but not allowing for moral paralysis. Innocent sufferers are closest to God's aching heart. I am connecting my own family and people's anguish with that of the Syrians' plight: ``My mother, a Holocaust survivor, Was young like you Scared Syrian sister, When she too got scarred By the pain of stinging tears, The beauty marks of refugees. May you also find peace At this confounding time, In a world abandoning you Too lonely child.'' We remember the million and a half Jewish children who were murdered in the Holocaust only because they were Jewish and held a promise for a noble future. ``My two year old first cousin, Rachel-Leah, Whose great- grandmother, and mine, Rachel-Leah, Was first cousin to President Chaim Weitzmann's mother, Rachel-Leah, Was too young to Know the family bond, But not too young to die By toasted hand grenades Led to the pits of slaughter In August 1942 With older brothers Aarale and Yisrael And parents Bas-Malka and Shechina, In Sarny, the Ukraine, By those who begrudged our Jewish people's pedigree.'' President John F. Kennedy coined this immortal message, ``Israel was not created to disappear--Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E590-E591] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 68TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL ______ HON.

FUGATE ______ HON. ANDY BARR of kentucky in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a very special individual, Pastor Jeffery J. Fugate, on the twenty fifth anniversary of his ministry at Clays Mill Road Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky. Pastor Fugate was saved at the age of five. When he was seven years old, Fugate's father started the Bible Baptist Church in Hazard, Kentucky. His father passed away when Fugate was twenty one, and Fugate became the church's new pastor. Pastor Fugate was called to Clays Mill Road Baptist Church in May of 1991. There were eighteen people in attendance at his first service. The church has grown to an average attendance of over 2,200 during the fall of 2013. Clays Mill Road Baptist Church has undergone many building and expansion projects to accommodate the growth, including the purchase and remodeling of an old motel on a beautiful 23 acre site.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in celebrating the life of Ivanhoe Donaldson, who passed on April 3, 2016. Ivanhoe Donaldson was born and raised in the Harlem section of New York City. He went south to join the civil rights movement and became a leader in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). I first knew Ivanhoe as a young man and a leading civil rights activist. Like several movement activists, Ivanhoe moved to the District of Columbia, attracted by the city's home-rule aspirations. Ivanhoe took risks as an SNCC activist and went on to build a reputation for political savvy in the 1960s and 1970s. He became a leading operative in Julian Bond's bid for a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives, Richard Hatcher's mayoral campaign in Gary, Indiana, and Marion Barry's campaign for office in D.C., which ushered in a new era of black political leadership. Ivanhoe leaves many friends across the country from the civil rights movement to many residents of the District of Columbia.

BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sister Mary Madonna Ashton, CSJ, who has earned the prominent distinction of being named a 2016 National Women's History Month Honoree by the National Women's History Project. This esteemed honor befits a woman who has dedicated her life to being a leader, advocate and policy-maker in the quest for equal access to health care for all in Minnesota and throughout the United States. Raised as an Episcopalian, Sister Mary Madonna converted to Catholicism while attending what is now Saint Catherine University in Saint Paul, Minnesota. After graduating and receiving a Masters of Social Work, she became a Sister of Saint Joseph of Carondelet, serving as a social worker at Saint Joseph's Hospital then later as an administrator at Saint Mary's Hospital after earning a second Master's degree. She was named President and CEO of Saint Mary's Hospital and stayed in that role for twenty years until her retirement in 1982. Sister Mary Madonna's first attempt at retirement was short lived. In 1983, Governor Rudy Perpich appointed her as the State Commissioner of Health. The appointment of the first woman and first non-physician as Health Commissioner was controversial at first. However, Sister Mary Madonna quickly earned respect from critics and supporters alike, by effectively challenging the tobacco industry and leading the state response to the onset of the AIDS crisis. During her two terms as Commissioner, she made Minnesota a pioneer in efforts to combat tobacco use. Our state was among the first to outlaw smoking in places of employment, hospitals and restaurants, a monumental legal and public health victory that would start a national movement. She also led the way in using state funding to combat underage smoking, ultimately leading to the Minnesota Twins removing all tobacco advertisements from its stadium and Northwest (now Delta) Airlines banning smoking on domestic flights. Since completing her appointment as Commissioner in 1991, Sister Mary Madonna has continued to serve those in need. She led the creation of Saint Mary's Health Clinics in order to provide quality health care for those without insurance. The clinics continue today with the same mission and serve as a reminder that though we have made much progress in making health care affordable and available to all, more work needs to be done. As a National Women's History Month Honoree, Sister Mary Madonna stands as one of 16 notable women who exemplify the National Women's History Project's 2016 theme of ``Working to Form a More Perfect Union: Honoring Women in Public Service and Government.'' Sister Mary Madonna and these other honorees join the company of such female trailblazers as Rosa Parks, Abigail Adams, Eleanor Roosevelt and Billie Jean King. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Sister Mary Madonna Ashton, CSJ of Saint Paul, Minnesota and all 16 Honorees for their commitment to public service and advocacy for others. These women stand as shining examples for all women and men for their dedication to the common good. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E592] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING 2016 NATIONAL WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH HONOREE SISTER MARY MADONNA ASHTON, CSJ ______ HON.

BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Robert Hill Youth Foundation, Inc., Charleston, MS inside of Tallahatchie County, MS. The Robert Hill Youth Foundation, Inc. began in the early 1980's by Mr. Robert Hill. [[Page E592]] It was initially conceived with the idea of simply being a sports organization for youth focusing on baseball. The organization eventually ceased being active after the death of Mr. Hill in 1991. In the year 2000, Mr. Cedric Terry revived the organization because the youth in the community didn't have many options for constructive activities and adult mentoring. He took on the task of recruiting children and parent's involvement. Mr. Terry was successful by getting 9 boys excited about playing baseball for the summer and competing. Their team would travel and they would be role models for other youth. Everyone had to pledge to abide by the rules, get good grades in school, and participate in an award ceremony at the end of the season. Mr. Terry's vision was just what the youth in the community needed to take the Robert Hill Youth Foundation to the next level. It was just what Mr. Hill always wanted the organization to be. The organization grew and became a huge success serving over 10,000 boys and girls. The effort was so well received that it attracted youth not just inside Charleston, but they came from miles outside the area. It now has extended its activities to include education, recreation and arts for youth in the area. Through their education program they offer: Abstinence Education, After School Tutoring, and Fatherhood Preparation. Their recreation program offers: basketball, football, baseball and track. The arts program includes: praise dancing, dancing and acting classes. Since 2000 through 2015 the organization has been responsible for helping over 500 boys and girls in the area attend and receive a college education. Their accolades are just as impressive. In fact, there are too many to name them all. A few of them include constructing the first park in Charleston in order to be home based for the youth. All they had to do was walk to the park and ``Play ball!'' Thanks to the Robert Hill Youth Foundation their work has reached all corners of youth life. In 2011 the Charleston High School Tigers Football Team won its 1st State Football Championship. Almost ninety percent of the players came from the Robert Hill Youth Foundation. In 2012 the Charleston High School Lady Tigers Basketball Team was the runner up in the Girls Basketball State Tournament. And over ninety-five percent of the girls played for the Robert Hill Youth Foundation. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today, in recognizing the Robert Hill Youth Foundation, an asset to Tallahatchie County in the Second Congressional District of Mississippi. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E591-E592] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING ROBERT HILL YOUTH FOUNDATION, INC. ______ HON.

The Robert Hill Youth Foundation, Inc. began in the early 1980's by Mr. Robert Hill. [[Page E592]] It was initially conceived with the idea of simply being a sports organization for youth focusing on baseball. The organization eventually ceased being active after the death of Mr. Hill in 1991. In the year 2000, Mr. Cedric Terry revived the organization because the youth in the community didn't have many options for constructive activities and adult mentoring. He took on the task of recruiting children and parent's involvement. Mr. Terry was successful by getting 9 boys excited about playing baseball for the summer and competing. Their team would travel and they would be role models for other youth. Everyone had to pledge to abide by the rules, get good grades in school, and participate in an award ceremony at the end of the season.

BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable public servant, Ms. Willie Rene Leflore. Ms. Leflore is a lifetime resident of Sunflower County, Mississippi. Ms. Leflore is a soldier encouraging others to sign up and be counted. In her words, ``Gone are the days of nurturing, chopping, hoeing, hauling water pails, getting up early, catching Bill Henderson's bus, etcetera, to work from sun up to sun down for $3.15 daily''. Growing up, Ms. Leflore wanted to be free to enter the front doors of Labella Restaurant and ride at the front of the Greyhound bus. So, Ms. Leflore took a stand, and marched beside Cora Stone Johnson, Nelson Dotson, John Richardson, Lene and others for her civil rights. Ms. Leflore is a soldier for what is right.

ALCEE L. HASTINGS of florida in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight an issue that is of growing concern: cancer that is specific to men. Cancer is a deadly disease that does not discriminate. It impacts all demographics and every segment of our population. However, what I find extremely alarming is that one in two men will be diagnosed with cancer over the course of their lifetimes. Men face a 43.31 percent lifetime risk of being diagnosed with some form of cancer. Statistics show that men have a 22.83 percent chance of dying from cancer versus 19.26 percent of women. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly 300,000 men die annually as a result of cancer. Various cancers are claiming the lives of males of all races and ages at an alarming rate. I will add, though, those African American men have the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates according the CDC. It is time for the Members of Congress to do our part to shine the light on this deadly disease that is plaguing the men of our communities. These men are our fathers, grandfathers, uncles, children, and nephews. No one should ever be put in a position to have to bury their child. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Resolution to Recognize June as National Men's Cancer Awareness Month. From prostate and colon cancer to lung and skin cancer, our nation needs to be more aware of what we can do to prevent, detect, and treat these fatal illnesses. Bringing about this awareness on an annual basis will aid in slowing the rate of cancer related fatalities. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E593] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION TO RECOGNIZE JUNE AS NATIONAL MEN'S CANCER AWARENESS MONTH ______ HON.

Ed Nelson was not only a pillar of the community, he was our foundation. He financed much of the growth of Nashville and imagined the `It' city before we became one. Ed's expertise and skill in banking, finance and international relations shaped the economic development of Middle Tennessee, and his philanthropic efforts have touched countless lives. Serving on dozens of local, national and international boards, Ed had the vision and will to make things happen. His success and leadership were notably recognized when the Bank of China invited him for a formal visit shortly after diplomatic relations were established in the 1970s. Ed's service as a U.S. military intelligence officer in Japan led to his insatiable desire to foster U.S.-Japan relations. Because of his tireless work, Nashville is now home to a Japanese Consul General and many Japanese businesses. In 2008, the Japanese government awarded him one of its most prestigious awards--the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon.

JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY of illinois in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent, Tema Posalska Bauer, on the occasion of her upcoming 100th birthday. Her birthday is especially notable in light of her miraculous survival through the horrors she endured during World War II. At the time that the Nazis invaded Poland in September of 1939, Tema was a young woman of 23 living with her elderly parents and her next oldest sister, Sarah, in the City of Lodz, a city that was home at the time to the second largest Jewish population in Poland. At the time, she had seven other older brothers and sisters who were married with children and living in smaller towns near Lodz. With the occupation by the Nazis, the siblings feared for the safety of their elderly parents and decided that it would be safer for the parents to move to the smaller town where one sister, Gucia, was living with her husband and three sons. Sarah accompanied them on the trip, and Tema was to close the house and follow after the winter. However, before the winter ended, the Nazis created a Jewish ghetto in Lodz in which all Jews had to reside and from which no Jews could leave. Tema never saw her parents or her sister Sarah again. She worked in the Ghetto for four years until she was deported in December of 1943 to a slave labor camp at Skarzysko-Kamienna. Normally a two-hour train ride from Lodz to Skarzysko-Kamienna, the trip actually took three full days. The women were packed into the freight train cars so tightly that there was no room to sit, no water, no food and no bathroom facilities. With the Russians approaching from the west, Skarzysko-Kamienna was liquidated in August of 1944 and the women were sent by freight trains to a slave labor camp in Leipzig, Germany. During an Allied bombing of the camp in February of 1945, Tema was injured--her right arm being severed at the elbow. Though antibiotics were unavailable, she had great luck and strength and survived. Two months later, the camp was liquidated, and she began what turned out to be a six-day death march, that she again miraculously survived. After liberation, she made her way back to Lodz where she found out that of her parents, eight brothers and sisters, their seven spouses and her eighteen nieces and nephews, all had been murdered by the Nazis, most of them gassed to death in the extermination camp at Chelmno--their bodies reduced to ash and bones in the crematoria. She eventually encountered a man she had known in the Ghetto, Morris Bauer. He told her that she need not be worried about the future because he would always take care of her. And, for the rest of his life, he did until he was no longer able to take care of himself. They married and then spent almost four years in a displaced persons camp waiting to emigrate to the United States. They arrived in the United States on October 1, 1949 and settled in Chicago. Tema's beloved husband, Morris, passed away in 1995 shortly before their 50th wedding anniversary from complications from Alzheimer's. She has lived to enjoy her expanding family of two sons, three grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. She remains mentally sharp with an amazing memory and with a keen interest in current events and politics. Tema's 100th birthday is May 5th--the same day the world will observe Holocaust Remembrance Day. As Tema gathers with her family that day to remember and mourn the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, including her and Morris' parents, siblings, nieces and nephews, her family also will celebrate the miraculous life and remarkable courage and luck of their family's matriarch, Tema Posalska Bauer. Her life is a blessing and an inspiration to her family and to all who know her. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E594] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY, TEMA POSALSKA BAUER ______ HON.

With the Russians approaching from the west, Skarzysko-Kamienna was liquidated in August of 1944 and the women were sent by freight trains to a slave labor camp in Leipzig, Germany. During an Allied bombing of the camp in February of 1945, Tema was injured--her right arm being severed at the elbow. Though antibiotics were unavailable, she had great luck and strength and survived. Two months later, the camp was liquidated, and she began what turned out to be a six-day death march, that she again miraculously survived. After liberation, she made her way back to Lodz where she found out that of her parents, eight brothers and sisters, their seven spouses and her eighteen nieces and nephews, all had been murdered by the Nazis, most of them gassed to death in the extermination camp at Chelmno--their bodies reduced to ash and bones in the crematoria. She eventually encountered a man she had known in the Ghetto, Morris Bauer. He told her that she need not be worried about the future because he would always take care of her. And, for the rest of his life, he did until he was no longer able to take care of himself. They married and then spent almost four years in a displaced persons camp waiting to emigrate to the United States. They arrived in the United States on October 1, 1949 and settled in Chicago. Tema's beloved husband, Morris, passed away in 1995 shortly before their 50th wedding anniversary from complications from Alzheimer's. She has lived to enjoy her expanding family of two sons, three grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. She remains mentally sharp with an amazing memory and with a keen interest in current events and politics. Tema's 100th birthday is May 5th--the same day the world will observe Holocaust Remembrance Day. As Tema gathers with her family that day to remember and mourn the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, including her and Morris' parents, siblings, nieces and nephews, her family also will celebrate the miraculous life and remarkable courage and luck of their family's matriarch, Tema Posalska Bauer. Her life is a blessing and an inspiration to her family and to all who know her. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,4084,4084,4152,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e594] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] happy 100th birthday, tema posalska bauer ______ hon. janice d. schakowsky of illinois in the house of representatives tuesday, april 26, 2016 ms. schakowsky. mr. speaker, i rise today to honor my constituent, tema posalska bauer, on the occasion of her upcoming 100th birthday. her birthday is especially notable in light of her miraculous survival through the horrors she endured during world war ii. at the time that the nazis invaded poland in september of 1939, tema was a young woman of 23 living with her elderly parents and her next oldest sister, sarah, in the city of lodz, a city that was home at the time to the second largest jewish population in poland. at the time, she had seven other older brothers and sisters who were married with children and living in smaller towns near lodz. with the occupation by the nazis, the siblings feared for the safety of their elderly parents and decided that it would be safer for the parents to move to the smaller town where one sister, gucia, was living with her husband and three sons. sarah accompanied them on the trip, and tema was to close the house and follow after the winter. however, before the winter ended, the nazis created a jewish ghetto in lodz in which all jews had to reside and from which no jews could leave. tema never saw her parents or her sister sarah again. she worked in the ghetto for four years until she was deported in december of 1943 to a slave labor camp at skarzysko-kamienna. normally a two-hour train ride from lodz to skarzysko-kamienna, the trip actually took three full days. the women were packed into the freight train cars so tightly that there was no room to sit, no water, no food and no bathroom facilities. with the russians approaching from the west, skarzysko-kamienna was liquidated in august of 1944 and the women were sent by freight trains to a slave labor camp in leipzig, germany. during an allied bombing of the camp in february of 1945, tema was injured--her right arm being severed at the elbow. though antibiotics were unavailable, she had great luck and strength and survived. two months later, the camp was liquidated, and she began what turned out to be a six-day death march, that she again miraculously survived. after liberation, she made her way back to lodz where she found out that of her parents, eight brothers and sisters, their seven spouses and her eighteen nieces and nephews, all had been murdered by the nazis, most of them gassed to death in the extermination camp at chelmno--their bodies reduced to ash and bones in the crematoria. she eventually encountered a man she had known in the ghetto, morris bauer. he told her that she need not be worried about the future because he would always take care of her. and, for the rest of his life, he did until he was no longer able to take care of himself. they married and then spent almost four years in a displaced persons camp waiting to emigrate to the united states. they arrived in the united states on october 1, 1949 and settled in chicago. tema's beloved husband, morris, passed away in 1995 shortly before their 50th wedding anniversary from complications from alzheimer's. she has lived to enjoy her expanding family of two sons, three grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. she remains mentally sharp with an amazing memory and with a keen interest in current events and politics. tema's 100th birthday is may 5th--the same day the world will observe holocaust remembrance day. as tema gathers with her family that day to remember and mourn the six million jews who perished in the holocaust, including her and morris' parents, siblings, nieces and nephews, her family also will celebrate the miraculous life and remarkable courage and luck of their family's matriarch, tema posalska bauer. her life is a blessing and an inspiration to her family and to all who know her. ____________________",4084

ANDRE CARSON of indiana in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, on April 26, 2016, I was unavoidably detained and missed roll call votes 164 and 165. Had I been present, I would have voted ``no'' on roll call 164, the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act, and ``yes'' on roll call 165, the Investor Clarity and Bank Parity Act. Despite missing the vote, I remain strongly opposed to H.R. 4820, the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act. As a former Homeland Security official and a Member of the House Intelligence Committee, I understand the importance of a complete intelligence picture to counterterrorism operations. As this bill indicates, part of understanding threats to our homeland is receiving testimony from reformed terrorists. Responsible collection would involve looking at threats from every angle, including Islamic, right wing, environmental and other types of extremism. This bill fails in that regard, choosing instead to focus on those associated with foreign terrorist organizations. This bill also plays into a disturbing narrative that Muslims are the sole source of terrorism in the United States. The reality, supported by academic research and federal agency testimony, is that the threat from right wing extremism is even more pervasive. While the attacks in Chattanooga and San Bernardino were carried out by Muslim extremists, the attacks at a church in Charleston and a Sikh temple in Wisconsin were by right wing extremists. Extremism, regardless of ideological basis, is dangerous and must be countered. Further perpetrating a false narrative about the outsized threat posed by Muslims does nothing but promote fear of American Muslims and ostracize them in communities across our country. It is important for us to remember that an attack by a sovereign citizen or racial supremacist is just as devastating as an attack by a Muslim terrorist. If Congress hopes to strengthen our national security apparatus, rather than stoke fear, we should be looking for every possible opportunity to balance our counterterrorism efforts. We need to look at all threats, both foreign and domestic. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E594] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PERSONAL EXPLANATION ______ HON.

Curtis Hill is the proud son of parents, Olivia Hill and Curtis Robinson; He has one, as he states, ``nerve racking little sibling'' that he loves dearly, Curshivia Robinson. Curtis Hill is entering his senior year at Holmes County Central High School (2015-2016) and has been a Youth Organizer with Nollie Jenkins Family Center, a grassroots community-based organization, for the past four years. With the help of his high school Curtis has been in position to receive numerous scholarships, most recently, he received the American Legion Scholarship, sponsored by Oratorical Competition in which he placed 2nd in the Area Competition; and Boys State, where he put his leadership skills to a test by role playing as if he was campaigning in a fictional state called Magnolia for the prestigious office of Lt. Governor. Curtis has also been chosen by the Electric Power Association, Yazoo Valley Electric Power Association, as one of two leaders to compete for scholarships and travel to Washington, D.C. Although, his school has provided him with these opportunities, the ground work was fertilely laid as a result of his community organizing work with the Nollie Jenkins Family Center. Through his work as a Youth Organizer, Curtis has developed career ready skills: public speaking, campaign development, facilitation, writing/creating resumes, and peer mediation. These skills proved to be of value when Curtis was chosen as a recipient of the Marguerite Casey Foundation's Sargent Shriver Youth Warriors Against Poverty Award. In contrast to all of his scholarly achievements, Curtis holds nothing closer to his heart than his ministry in mime, for this heart warmer and barrier breaker is a way for Curtis to feel closer and at one with his King, Jehovah God. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Curtis Hill who gives back to his community, encourages others to do more than what's common and makes a difference in his community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E594] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING CURTIS HILL ______ HON.

DAVID G. VALADAO of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Stratford Portuguese Hall Association on its 100th anniversary of service to our community. The Stratford Portuguese Hall Association was founded in December 1915, when a group of Portuguese immigrants from the Azores Islands assembled to join the Brotherhood of the Divine Holy Spirit in the community of Stratford, California. In 2010, several Portuguese fraternal organizations, including the Brotherhood of the Divine Holy Spirit, consolidated to form the Portuguese Fraternal Society of America. Stratford Portuguese Hall brought the ``Festa'' weekend traditions of serving sopas, dancing, and parades to Stratford for the first time in 1916. The celebrations can be traced back to medieval Portugal when Queen Isabel made offerings of food and festival to the people in 1296. Since 1916, these Portuguese traditions have been shared with the community of Stratford. The goal of the ``Festa'' is to honor the past, celebrate the present, and encourage the future, while celebrating the Portuguese culture. To reach a 100-year milestone is a remarkable achievement, and Stratford Portuguese Hall Association has had to overcome many challenges to reach this point, including a devastating fire that destroyed the Hall in 2003. However, the Hall was able to meet the challenges it was presented with, and continues to serve our community today. As the son of Portuguese immigrants, I am proud of this incredible achievement. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Stratford Portuguese Hall on their 100th anniversary and wishing them a happy ``Festa'' this year. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E595] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF STRATFORD PORTUGUESE HALL ______ HON.

Stratford Portuguese Hall brought the ``Festa'' weekend traditions of serving sopas, dancing, and parades to Stratford for the first time in 1916. The celebrations can be traced back to medieval Portugal when Queen Isabel made offerings of food and festival to the people in 1296. Since 1916, these Portuguese traditions have been shared with the community of Stratford. The goal of the ``Festa'' is to honor the past, celebrate the present, and encourage the future, while celebrating the Portuguese culture. To reach a 100-year milestone is a remarkable achievement, and Stratford Portuguese Hall Association has had to overcome many challenges to reach this point, including a devastating fire that destroyed the Hall in 2003. However, the Hall was able to meet the challenges it was presented with, and continues to serve our community today. As the son of Portuguese immigrants, I am proud of this incredible achievement. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Stratford Portuguese Hall on their 100th anniversary and wishing them a happy ``Festa'' this year. ____________________",package_114_170.csv,2038,2038,2106,"[congressional record volume 162, number 64 (tuesday, april 26, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e595] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] in recognition of stratford portuguese hall ______ hon. david g. valadao of california in the house of representatives tuesday, april 26, 2016 mr. valadao. mr. speaker, i rise today to recognize the stratford portuguese hall association on its 100th anniversary of service to our community. the stratford portuguese hall association was founded in december 1915, when a group of portuguese immigrants from the azores islands assembled to join the brotherhood of the divine holy spirit in the community of stratford, california. in 2010, several portuguese fraternal organizations, including the brotherhood of the divine holy spirit, consolidated to form the portuguese fraternal society of america. stratford portuguese hall brought the ``festa'' weekend traditions of serving sopas, dancing, and parades to stratford for the first time in 1916. the celebrations can be traced back to medieval portugal when queen isabel made offerings of food and festival to the people in 1296. since 1916, these portuguese traditions have been shared with the community of stratford. the goal of the ``festa'' is to honor the past, celebrate the present, and encourage the future, while celebrating the portuguese culture. to reach a 100-year milestone is a remarkable achievement, and stratford portuguese hall association has had to overcome many challenges to reach this point, including a devastating fire that destroyed the hall in 2003. however, the hall was able to meet the challenges it was presented with, and continues to serve our community today. as the son of portuguese immigrants, i am proud of this incredible achievement. mr. speaker, i ask my colleagues in the house of representatives to join me in recognizing stratford portuguese hall on their 100th anniversary and wishing them a happy ``festa'' this year. ____________________",2038

SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a man of purpose, sincerity, and high character, Coach David Pollard. Sadly and tragically, Coach Pollard passed away on April 18, 2016, as a result of a senseless accident. His funeral services were held on Sunday, April 24, 2016 at 3 pm at Cascade Hills Church in Columbus, Georgia. Coach Pollard was born on March 28, 1980 in Columbus, Georgia to the union of Terry and Sandra Pollard Render. He was a 1998 graduate of Shaw High School and 2002 graduate of Albany State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. He was pursuing a Master's Degree in Psychology from Columbus State University. He was a highly respected educator and coach with stops as a community coach at Jordan Vocational High School and he was serving as a teacher and the Head Baseball Coach at George Washington Carver High School at the time of his passing. George Washington Carver once said, ``How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and strong. Because someday in your life you will have been all of these.'' Coach David Pollard understood these lessons very well. He dedicated his life to helping others--especially our most precious resources--young people. He used the season of his life to help others to reach their full potential. He was dedicated to his craft as both a teacher and a coach. His engaging personality and steadfast faith in God as a member of Central Baptist Church made him a person that was admired and respected by all that came in contact with him. Coach Pollard was universally respected by his peers in the baseball coaching fraternity. He was loved by his players, students and colleagues. But, he knew that his life would be measured not by wins and losses on a sports field but by the difference he made in the lives of his students and players. We all can learn so much from the life of Coach David Pollard. We must live everyday as if it were our last. Treat all people with dignity and respect and make a difference in the lives of others. His greatest role in life was that of a dedicated husband and father. Just as he demonstrated a great love for people, he demonstrated an even greater love for his family. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian and me, along with more than 730,000 people of the Second Congressional District in extending condolences to his wife, Adrienne, his daughter Joy and his entire family. ``To God Be the Glory'' for the life of Coach David Pollard for his contributions to the betterment of humankind. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E595] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF COACH DAVID POLLARD ______ HON.

KEN CALVERT of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to the remarkable Jacques `Jack' Yeager who passed away in California on Wednesday, April 20, 2016. Jack was a pillar of the community in Riverside, California, and he will be deeply missed. Born in Riverside in 1921, Jack went to local schools and graduated from Poly High School in 1939. While attending college at UC Berkeley, Jack left school to join the U.S. Navy Seabees and eventually helped build airports throughout the South Pacific during World War II. Jack eventually returned home to join the family construction business, E. L. Yeager Construction Company, which was founded by his father. At Yeager Construction, Jack worked alongside his brothers, Dick and Gene, and played an important role in the growth and success of the company. Yeager Construction was responsible for building many significant highway and other construction projects in Southern California and around the country. I had the privilege of working together with Jack on a number of projects and causes over the years, and felt fortunate to see his passion and dedication to improving our community first- hand. In 1948, Jack Yeager married Mary Barbara Gibbs and the couple had two sons and three daughters. Mary passed away in 1990. Later, Jack would marry Helen Hays, who died in 2009. As an active member of his community, Jack participated in a number of organizations, often in a leadership role, including: Co-founder and member of the Monday Morning Group, Board Member of the Riverside Community Hospital Foundation, Board Member of the UC Riverside Citizens University Committee, member of the Riverside County Transportation Commission, Board Member of the March Field Museum Foundation, and Board Member of the UC Board of Regents. The way in which Jack lived his life should serve as reminder that the power of an individual with drive, perseverance and a strong work ethic can do great things. His dedication to his work, family, and community are a testament to a life well lived and a legacy that will continue. I was proud to call Jack my friend and I will deeply miss him. I extend my condolences to Jack's family and friends; although Jack may be gone, the many incredible contributions he made to our region and the country remain and will never be forgotten. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 64 (Tuesday, April 26, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E595] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JACQUES `JACK' YEAGER ______ HON.

BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 26, 2016 Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the Armenian Genocide, which began 101 years ago this month. In nearly a decade of terror that followed, the leaders of the Ottoman Empire systemically exposed the Armenian people to torture, starvation, abduction, deportation, and mass killing. More than 1.5 million innocent Armenian children, women, and men were murdered. And millions more were expelled from their historic homeland. All nations and peoples have a responsibility to recognize this tragedy and the reverberations it has caused for succeeding generations. Unfortunately, the historic fact of the Armenian Genocide has all too often been obscured, downplayed, or simply rejected. As an international community, we must properly account for this historic crime, move towards peace and reconciliation in the region, and help those who carry the scars of this atrocity to heal. The United States owes a responsibility to the victims and their descendants to publicly call the events of 101 years ago genocide. And our government should demand that Turkey--our NATO ally--acknowledge its historic responsibility for this crime. On this somber occasion, we should remember and pray for the victims, those who survived, and the Armenian community around the world that honors its ancestors by doggedly pursuing the truth. And, as Americans, we must once against reaffirm our resolve to prevent genocide.
