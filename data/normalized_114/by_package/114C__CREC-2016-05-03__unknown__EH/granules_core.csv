MARIO DIAZ-BALART of florida in the house of representatives Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the retirement of Major Rey Valdes, who has served the Miami-Dade community as a police officer for over thirty-one years. Major Valdes began his career as an officer, and has risen steadily through the ranks. Throughout his time in the Miami-Dade Police Department he has exhibited a passion for continued education, respect and compassion for his colleagues, and an understanding of the seriousness and importance of the profession he chose. At various times during his career, Major Valdes worked with the homicide bureau, the narcotics bureau, and warrants management in several different roles throughout the department. In his current position, Major Valdes is responsible for all aspects of the Communications Bureau of the Miami-Dade Police Department. The Communications Bureau is the largest 911 Center in the southeastern United States, and the fourth largest in the country. Even as he is preparing to leave the department, Major Valdes is currently studying to take the test to be certified as an Anti-Money Laundering Specialist. This credential will add to his value as a Certified Fraud Examiner. He hopes to continue to work in the field of fraud examination after his retirement. Miami-Dade has been lucky to have had such an exceptional individual serving in its police force. Through the years, I have gotten to know Rey personally, as his daughter Katrina serves as my communications director, and am honored to call him a friend. I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to Rey on his illustrious and productive career, and extend my warmest wishes to his wife Elizabeth, and children Giorey, Armani, and Katrina. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to Major Rey Valdes for his tremendous service to the Miami community, and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this remarkable individual. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 69 (Tuesday, May 3, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E645] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING MAJOR REY VALDES ON HIS RETIREMENT ______ HON.

MARIO DIAZ-BALART of florida in the house of representatives Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the retirement of Major Rey Valdes, who has served the Miami-Dade community as a police officer for over thirty-one years. Major Valdes began his career as an officer, and has risen steadily through the ranks. Throughout his time in the Miami-Dade Police Department he has exhibited a passion for continued education, respect and compassion for his colleagues, and an understanding of the seriousness and importance of the profession he chose. At various times during his career, Major Valdes worked with the homicide bureau, the narcotics bureau, and warrants management in several different roles throughout the department. In his current position, Major Valdes is responsible for all aspects of the Communications Bureau of the Miami-Dade Police Department. The Communications Bureau is the largest 911 Center in the southeastern United States, and the fourth largest in the country. Even as he is preparing to leave the department, Major Valdes is currently studying to take the test to be certified as an Anti-Money Laundering Specialist. This credential will add to his value as a Certified Fraud Examiner. He hopes to continue to work in the field of fraud examination after his retirement. Miami-Dade has been lucky to have had such an exceptional individual serving in its police force. Through the years, I have gotten to know Rey personally, as his daughter Katrina serves as my communications director, and am honored to call him a friend. I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to Rey on his illustrious and productive career, and extend my warmest wishes to his wife Elizabeth, and children Giorey, Armani, and Katrina.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in celebrating the 26th annual DC Black Pride celebration on May 27-29, 2016. DC Black Pride 2016 is a multi-day festival featuring a reception, films, a poetry slam, a church service, educational workshops, community town hall meetings, a basketball tournament, an awards ceremony, and a health and wellness expo, among other events. We in the District of Columbia are pleased and proud that the DC Black Pride celebration is widely considered to be one of the world's preeminent Black Pride celebrations, drawing more than 30,000 people to the nation's capital from across the United States as well as [[Page E646]] from Canada, the Caribbean, South Africa, Great Britain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. As the very first Black Pride festival, DC Black Pride fostered the beginning of the Center for Black Equity (formerly known as the International Federation of Black Prides, Inc. (IFBP)) and the ``Black Pride Movement,'' which now consists of 40 Black Prides on four continents. The Center For Black Equity, the celebration's organizing body, chose: ``I AM U. U R ME. WE ARE PRIDE!'' as the theme for this year's celebration. DC Black Pride is a project of the Center For Black Equity and is coordinated by Earl D. Fowlkes, Jr. and Kenya Hutton with assistance from a volunteer advisory board, which coordinates this annual event and consists of Andrea Woody-Macko; Shannon Garcon; Genise Chambers- Woods; Reginald Shaw-Richardson; and Gladece Knight. I ask the House to join me in welcoming all attending the 26th annual DC Black Pride celebration in Washington, D.C., and I take this opportunity to remind the celebrants that United States citizens who reside in the District of Columbia are taxed without full voting representation in Congress. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 69 (Tuesday, May 3, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E645-E646] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 26TH ANNUAL DC BLACK PRIDE CELEBRATION ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Elena Izcalli Medina on being honored by United States Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera at the Library of Congress. The 21st Poet Laureate Consultant Juan Felipe Herrera celebrated the conclusion of the first year of his laureateship by honoring young poet Elena Izcalli Medina at the Library of Congress. Elena Izcalli is a 7th grader attending High Tech Middle School in Chula Vista, California. She has been writing poetry for four years. She first received praise from Herrera in 2012 for her poem ``Where I am from'' which Herrera said ``contained a philosophical reflection about how all of us are impermanent. It was just a solid poem where she really touched base with wisdom.'' Herrera made an unprecedented gesture by arranging for Elena Izcalli and her family to attend the last lecture of his first term. Herrera presented Elena Izcalli to guests and dignitaries at the Library of Congress where she read her poem ``One Day'' on April 13, 2016. I would like to submit her poem. One Day (by Elena Izcalli Medina) One day the border will come down And all the colors will flow and We will grant ALL a crown. One day police brutality will be no more And ALL will have equality no matter who you Are fighting for. One day we will ALL love each other No matter what skin what religion because we are from the same mother. One day we will treat the environment like a human being And ALL of nature Can go back to being free. One day when someone is shot Black and brown Lives will matter And ALL will stand up to the cops. One day we will have peace between countries and instead of starting war we will grant each other awards One day we will find each other the same and realize we ALL go through sunshine and rain. One day we will look at women so they are not objectified But we'll pay attention to who they are inside and instead of calling them bossy We will take away the y. 'Cause I wonder why, why this belief is still alive. My hair flies freely in the wind Me being proud of the color of my skin I inhale clean air and exhale my worries But one worry that stays inside me is the idea that this one day might not come One day.

RON & MARY THOMAS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND AND THE GREATER TACOMA COMMUNITY ______ HON. DEREK KILMER of washington in the house of representatives Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Ron & Mary Thomas, who this spring will complete their thirteenth and final year at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, WA. Dr. Thomas has served as the University's thirteenth President since 2003 and has left a historic mark on this already prestigious institution of higher education. The University of Puget Sound is a more diverse, inclusive, comprehensive, accessible, and transformational place because of their leadership. Thousands of students, faculty, staff, and community members have been positively impacted by their presence in this community. Prior to arriving at Puget Sound, Dr. Thomas served as a faculty member at the University of Chicago, Harvard University, and Trinity College. His career in higher education is decorated with numerous recognitions for contributions in writing, student life, and institutional leadership. With the arrival of Ron and Mary Thomas to Tacoma in the summer of 2003, the University of Puget Sound began its historic growth and transformation. Mr. Speaker, for the past thirteen years, Dr. Thomas has led and overseen a renewal of the already beautiful University of Puget Sound campus. To complement the already stunning views of Mt. Rainier and towering Douglas fir trees, Dr. Thomas and his staff directed over $200 million in campus capital improvements. These projects include a new academic science complex, upgrades in residential facilities, and athletic and recreational centers to bolster student life. Thankfully, Dr. Thomas and his team ensured that these projects were encompassed into a thoughtful and comprehensive campus master plan. In addition to physical improvements on campus, Dr. Thomas and his wife Mary will forever be remembered in Tacoma for their dedication to the community and for successfully following through on their vision to connect the Puget Sound campus to the community that surrounds it. Since their arrival, Ron and Mary have been generous with their time and resources in supporting the civic and cultural institutions of Tacoma. Mr. Speaker, during his tenure at UPS, Dr. Thomas helped create the ``Tacoma Public Schools Commitment,'' which created a clear pathway for local students to attend this private, liberal-arts education at an affordable price. Given the community's diversity and challenges in paying for higher education, this initiative will help grow future generations of engaged and educated citizens of Tacoma. Mr. Speaker, I join the larger Tacoma communities in expressing my gratitude today in the United States Congress for Dr. Ron and Mary Thomas for their thirteen years of leadership and dedication. As the proud Representative for Tacoma, WA in the House of Representatives, I offer my best wishes on their future adventures together. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 69 (Tuesday, May 3, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E647] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE LEADERSHIP AND DEDICATION OF DR.

Poland adopted the first written constitution in Europe on May 3, 1791. With the leadership of King Stanislaw August, Poland's constitution established many of the same principles of freedom and democracy ratified in the United States, like freedom of religion, the separation of powers, and political equality. I am proud to represent New Britain, Connecticut, which has more residents of Polish descent than any other community in our great state. Polish-Americans have made invaluable contributions to the social, cultural, and economic life and history of communities in central and northwest Connecticut, and throughout our great state. As a member of the Congressional Caucus on Poland, I am committed to strengthening the bilateral relationship between Poland and the United States. Those bonds of friendship date back centuries, and have only grown stronger through solidarity in the Cold War and continued collaboration to expand economic opportunity and promote security in the region and around the world.

ELIZABETH H. ESTY of connecticut in the house of representatives Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize today's Polish Day celebration at the Connecticut State Capitol, and to congratulate the Polish people in celebrating the 225th anniversary of Europe's oldest written constitution. Poland adopted the first written constitution in Europe on May 3, 1791. With the leadership of King Stanislaw August, Poland's constitution established many of the same principles of freedom and democracy ratified in the United States, like freedom of religion, the separation of powers, and political equality. I am proud to represent New Britain, Connecticut, which has more residents of Polish descent than any other community in our great state. Polish-Americans have made invaluable contributions to the social, cultural, and economic life and history of communities in central and northwest Connecticut, and throughout our great state. As a member of the Congressional Caucus on Poland, I am committed to strengthening the bilateral relationship between Poland and the United States.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, last Friday I introduced the ``Stop Infant Mortality and Recidivism Reduction Act of 2016,'' or the ``SIMARRA Act,'' which will help the Federal Bureau of Prisons to improve the effectiveness [[Page E648]] and efficiency of the Federal prison system for pregnant offenders, by establishing a pilot program of critical-stage, developmental nurseries in Federal prisons for children born to inmates. It is time that our nation recognizes a long-persistent need to break the cycle of generational, institutional incarceration amongst mothers convicted of non-violent crimes and the children they birth behind prison bars. H.R. 5130, the ``SIMARRA Act of 2016,'' gives those infants born to incarcerated mothers a chance to succeed in life. ``SIMARRA'' is not merely yet another second chance program, demanding leniency from the criminal justice system. Instead, H.R. 5130 asks our national criminal justice system what it can do for those young Americans born and relegated to a life of nearly impossible odds of survival. ``SIMARRA'' provides that first chance--a first chance for American infants--that many of their mothers, born themselves to mothers behind bars, never received. We have a unique opportunity to nurture infants with the ``SIMARRA Act of 2016,'' providing them a true head start. A 2015 article in the National, estimated that at least 10,000 babies are born to American prisoners annually. This issue is affecting more children and women than we realize. The New York Times reported that approximately 25 percent of incarcerated women are pregnant, carrying children, on admission to prison, or gave birth during the previous year, still requiring special medical and nutritional resources for the health of their infants, as well as themselves. Current Federal Bureau of Prison policy dictates that, in most cases, incarcerated mothers relinquish their children immediately after giving birth, handing them over to friends or family members, and most often to the foster care system. Eleven percent of those children separated from incarcerated mothers and placed into foster care experienced at least two changes in caregivers during the period of the mother's incarceration; and sometimes these mothers, even when they have short prison sentences, never see their child again--forever lost to the foster-care system. This practice is devastating the wellness and safety of American infants, denying them the ability to lactate, bond and thrive with their mother's host body, as healthy infants require during the critical stage of development. Children born to mothers in prison and removed to social services programs also experience parental separation, and often illicit substance use, mental illness, and domestic violence, all of which are adverse childhood experiences associated with morbidity and premature mortality. Neo-natal health science tells us that positive social interactions in a child's early years are considered critical to the development of healthy social relationships and personality growth. Studies indicate that, upon entering early childhood educational programs, children born to incarcerated women are at higher risk of behavioral health problems than their peers. It should not surprise anyone familiar with the juvenile criminal justice system that children of incarcerated women are more likely to be caught up in the criminal justice system themselves, deflating the upward trajectory of their life's potential. The writing is on the wall: there is a positive, statistically significant correlation between the total incarceration rate and the infant mortality. Studies reveal that newborn babies separated from their mothers, due to confinement, suffer health and psychological complications such as weakened attachment, bonding and abandonment at exponentially compounded rates. Ten states currently operate successful similar programs and studies have shown that 71 percent of the babies served attained attachment goals with their inmate-mothers while in a prison nursery setting, a percentage greater than that reported by most low-risk, community children whose mothers had no criminal history or involvement. Nursery participants also had a lower recidivism rate compared to non-participating mothers. In spite of the fact that the mothers of most of these children had not internalized secure attachment in their own childhoods, 71 percent of the babies achieved secure attachment with their own mothers while in the prison nursery setting. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the national infant mortality rate is 5.96 deaths per 1,000 births, increasing to 7.9 infant deaths per 1,000 live births for Hispanic inmates, and 14.3 infant deaths per 1,000 live births among African American inmates. Other studies have documented that parental incarceration elevates the risk of early infant death by 29.6 percent for the average infant, concentrating effects during the post-neonatal period. The data demonstrates that incarceration compounds women's depression and the risk of contracting infectious or chronic stress-related illnesses, which may harm infant health through numerous mechanisms also increasing infant mortality rates. The ``SIMARRA Act'' will decrease unprecedentedly high current infant mortality rates and allow inmate mothers to provide healthy and safe gestation to protect their unborn, as well as bond with infants during their first 30 months of life, designated by the CDC as one of the most critical stages of development. Further, H.R. 5130 simultaneously implements risk and needs assessments, risk reduction incentives, and risk and recidivism reduction programs to address the healthcare, safety and rehabilitative needs of new-mother-inmates as they serve their sentence. Mass incarceration not only fosters inequality but also diminishes a child's chances of surviving its first year of life, which combined together can further hinder a child's life chances. The most likely long-term mechanism through which imprisonment affects infant mortality is through its effects on maternal health. Mr. Speaker, as a nation we do not have a person to waste, so we must embrace practices that nurture the bonds between mother and child. The ``SIMARRA Act'' will provide resources and programming to ensure a healthy and safe environment for these children during their critical stages of development. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring and supporting H.R. 5130, the ``Stop Infant Mortality and Recidivism Reduction Act of 2016'' or the ``SIMARRA Act.''","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 69 (Tuesday, May 3, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E647-E648] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] H.R. 5130, THE ``STOP INFANT MORTALITY AND RECIDIVISM REDUCTION ACT OF 2016'' (``SIMARRA ACT'') ______ HON.
