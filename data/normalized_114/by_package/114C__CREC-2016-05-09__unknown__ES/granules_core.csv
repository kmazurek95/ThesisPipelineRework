Bob Bennett said there are two kinds of Senators in Washington-- workhorses and show horses. It is clear to anyone who knew him which path Senator Bennett followed. This former chaplain, entrepreneur, and CEO came to the Senate with a long resume and a formidable work effort. Over his 18 years of service, Bob typified the constructive player with the steady hand, the kind of Senator who preferred the low-key work of legislating to the bright lights of the media. Bob worked hard to develop relationships in both parties, and he approached everything he did with creativity, with substance, and with honor. Senator Bennett served as a member of our conference leadership team, sat on important committees, and pressed forward on a range of different issues. He also shared my interest in the First Amendment. Bob would be the first to tell you that he viewed his most important job as being a husband. I think his wife Joyce felt the same way. In more than 50 years of marriage, the Bennetts worked together to raise six children. They were blessed with 20 grandchildren as well.

A return to regular order means empowering Senators from both sides to make more responsible judgments as to how taxpayer dollars are spent. It means allowing Senators to better represent the voices of their constituents throughout the legislative process. Beginning the process early means giving Senators from both sides more opportunity to debate and offer ideas they think might make these bills even better. This is the way the appropriations process is supposed to work, and with a little cooperation, we can keep it moving forward this week.

Mr. President, last Wednesday, the Senate lost one of its Members, our friend and colleague Bob Bennett. He passed away at his home in Arlington, VA. There is a whole lot I can say about Bob Bennett. He was my friend. Landra and I were close to him and his lovely wife Joyce. As Senator McConnell said, he was a three-term Senator. He was a scholar, author, and celebrated businessman. He took over this company, Franklin Quest-- those little books that were so popular a number of years ago. It had four employees. Within 7 years, that company had 1,000 employees, and its income was $100 million a year. Some of you will remember the little Franklin day planner we all had because of Senator Bennett. When I think of Senator Bennett, courage comes to mind. He was one of the most courageous Senators with whom I served. He was a conservative Republican from a conservative State, Utah. A majority of the time he voted that way. But Bob also firmly believed neither political party nor their differing ideologies had a monopoly on good governance, and he spoke about this openly. This is what he said during his farewell speech on the Senate floor: The Democrats are the party of government. Going back to their roots with Franklin Roosevelt, they come to the conclusion that if there is a problem, government should solve that problem. The Republicans are the party of free markets, and they come to the conclusion that if there is a problem, it should be left to the markets to solve it. And they are both right. That is the thing I have come to understand here. There are some problems where government is the solution--but not always. There are some problems where free markets do provide the solution--but not always. Bob Bennett practiced what he preached. In the fall of 2008, the global markets were in a free fall. The American economy was reeling. Something needed to be done. President George W. Bush turned to Congress for help. Where else could he turn? We, the Congress, passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which prevented the collapse of our Nation's largest financial institutions. Despite the pressure from his own party, Senator Bennett voted for TARP. He voted to save our country and our economy. It was perhaps the most courageous vote ever cast in the Senate. It didn't sit well with the tea party, which was very strong in Utah. They used the State's Republican primary to remove Senator Bennett from office. It is a very unusual procedure there. If it had been any other State in the Union, Bob Bennett would still be in the Senate. But in spite of all of that, Bob was blessed with an unshakeable moral compass. He knew what he did was right, and he had no regrets. Time and a resurgent American economy had vindicated Senator Bennett's vote on TARP and other things. I count myself very fortunate to have served with this good man. I will forever be grateful for him--this honorable, decent person who was my friend. Today my thoughts are with his family, his wife Joyce, who is an accomplished flutist. She is a professional flute player. On codels I took with Senator Bennett--I remember one where we left here and went to Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador--over the great lands that we passed and over the waters that we passed, often she would come and entertain us with her flute. She is a marvelous woman. I want her to know that Senator Bennett will be missed by the Senate, the people of Utah, our country, and me. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2606] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING BOB BENNETT Mr. REID.

Mr. President, last Wednesday, the Senate lost one of its Members, our friend and colleague Bob Bennett. He passed away at his home in Arlington, VA. There is a whole lot I can say about Bob Bennett. He was my friend. Landra and I were close to him and his lovely wife Joyce. As Senator McConnell said, he was a three-term Senator. He was a scholar, author, and celebrated businessman. He took over this company, Franklin Quest-- those little books that were so popular a number of years ago. It had four employees. Within 7 years, that company had 1,000 employees, and its income was $100 million a year. Some of you will remember the little Franklin day planner we all had because of Senator Bennett. When I think of Senator Bennett, courage comes to mind. He was one of the most courageous Senators with whom I served. He was a conservative Republican from a conservative State, Utah. A majority of the time he voted that way. But Bob also firmly believed neither political party nor their differing ideologies had a monopoly on good governance, and he spoke about this openly. This is what he said during his farewell speech on the Senate floor: The Democrats are the party of government. Going back to their roots with Franklin Roosevelt, they come to the conclusion that if there is a problem, government should solve that problem. The Republicans are the party of free markets, and they come to the conclusion that if there is a problem, it should be left to the markets to solve it. And they are both right. That is the thing I have come to understand here. There are some problems where government is the solution--but not always. There are some problems where free markets do provide the solution--but not always. Bob Bennett practiced what he preached. In the fall of 2008, the global markets were in a free fall. The American economy was reeling. Something needed to be done. President George W. Bush turned to Congress for help. Where else could he turn? We, the Congress, passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which prevented the collapse of our Nation's largest financial institutions.

Mr. President, a notable thing happened this weekend across the Atlantic. The people of London, England, elected Sadiq Khan as the first Muslim mayor of their city. The mayor of the city of London is a Muslim, a proud Muslim. That election speaks to the openness and tolerance exhibited by England. Let us not forget that England is a Protestant nation. According to the Nation's most recent census, the people of London are predominantly Christian. When London voters went to the polls, they refused to allow Mr. Khan's religion to be the deciding factor. They refused to give in to the bigotry and Islamic rhetoric that is plaguing American politics. Instead, Londoners voted for the candidate whom they thought would best represent their interests and who happened to be a Muslim. The election of Sadiq Khan is an example of how a democracy should operate--independent of fear and prejudice. This is what he said yesterday: I have spent my entire life encouraging minority communities to get involved in civil society, in mainstream politics. I've been fighting extremism and radicalization all my life. You should conduct politics in a positive way to enthuse people to get involved.

CREC-2016-05-09-pt1-PgS2606-4,CREC-2016-05-09,114,DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2606-S2607] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY Mr. REID. Mr. President, Donald Trump is the Republican Presidential nominee. Let's think about that--the party of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and many other Republicans, such as Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower. The party of these great people nominated a misogynistic, anti-Latino, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrant xenophobe. The party of Teddy Roosevelt nominated a billionaire con man who scams working people. Donald Trump represents everything that Americans detest about a system that is rigged for the super-rich. Here is a person who was born into immense wealth, but he uses his father's fortune to rip people off and intimidate those who speak out against his shady business practices. Here is a person who was gifted with the resources to make a difference in the world. He could be doing many things to improve the lives of working Americans. Instead, he has only worked to build his own celebrity, his own brand. He uses that fame as a bully pulpit to sow hatred and intolerance. Yet, in spite of all of this, Donald Trump is now the Republican Party's Presidential nominee. He is no accident. His nomination is not some mistake. Donald Trump is the natural evolution of a party that spent 8 years honing a platform that is anti-immigrant, anti-woman, anti-Obama, and anti-working people. It wasn't all that long ago that Republicans used to engage Democrats on policy. There was a time when we could work together on substantive legislation. I saw it. I felt it. It was wonderful. But all that ended when President Obama was elected. Senator McConnell ordered a total blockade of any policy proposed by President Obama and any Democrats. Led by Senator McConnell, Republicans have abandoned the marketplace of ideas. They abandoned thoughtful policy for fear and resentment politics. It didn't matter where these ideas came from. It didn't matter if they came from Republicans. Republican leaders repeated their one big line over and over: ``Whatever President Obama proposes, even if it's a Republican idea, it cannot help you and will hurt you.'' These are not my ideas. They have been written about and confirmed for years. For Republicans, it wasn't about helping the American people anymore. It was all about embarrassing and humiliating President Obama and frustrating his agenda no matter the cost. All the while, Donald Trump was watching as the Republican Party lost its identity and its moral compass. Trump watched as Republican leaders embraced the darkest elements of their party. Now Trump is doing what he learned from Senator McConnell and every other Republican leader for the past 8 years. Trump watched how Republicans in Congress treat American women. He saw Republicans block equal pay for [[Page S2607]] women and undermine women's health care. ``Planned Parenthood'' became a swear word. Donald Trump has treated women with disdain. He has called women dogs, pigs, and he defends rape. Trump watched as congressional Republicans walked away from comprehensive immigration reform. He listened as House Republicans likened DREAMers to drug mules. Is it any surprise that Donald Trump-- now the Republican nominee--uses Latinos and immigrants to generate fear, to be a fearmonger? He has called undocumented immigrants criminals and rapists. Donald Trump has watched Republicans deny the existence of climate change, and he is following in their footsteps. He would rather believe in crackpot conspiracy theories than accept climate change. It is real, but this is what he said about climate change: ``The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make United States manufacturing noncompetitive.'' Try that one on. That is a direct quote. That kind of harebrained thinking has no place in the White House, but sadly it is not far from the anti-science climate change denial that is now Republican Party doctrine. On nearly every issue, Donald Trump has simply adopted the positions of the modern Republican Party. Through their obstruction and anti- Obama politics, Senator McConnell and Republican leaders constructed Donald Trump's Presidential campaign and his platform piece by piece. He is the nominee of the Republican Party, and he is the nominee the Republican leaders deserve. Now the Republican Party is his. Republicans want Trump to be their standard bearer. They are scrambling to get behind this hate-spewing nominee. There is no better example of Republicans marching lockstep with Trump than the Supreme Court vacancy. The Republican National Committee is trying to bring their party together by promising this dangerous man will appoint Justices to the Supreme Court. Republicans say they want their misogynistic, anti-women, anti-Latino, anti-middle class billionaire to determine the balance of the Supreme Court for the next generation. Republican Senators say they trust the judgment of a man who mocks our veterans, belittles John McCain as not being a war hero, and mocks Americans with disabilities. They want him to fill the Supreme Court. It is a sad day for this country when the Republican Party trusts the judgment of a vile, swindling billionaire. But anyone who has been paying attention to what Republicans have been doing the past 8 years should not be shocked. Hillary Clinton is going to be the Democratic nominee. I support Hillary Clinton. I am not hiding from that. Republican Senators need to stop waffling about Donald Trump. Not going to the convention doesn't take away the fact that he is the Republican nominee. I have heard a number of Republican Senators say: I am not going to the convention. Well, that solves the problem, doesn't it? Republican Senators need to say whether they are going to vote for this guy. The Republican Party's chickens have come home to roost in the form of Donald J. Trump. Mr. President, I ask the Presiding Officer to announce--I see Senator Alexander, the senior Senator from Tennessee, on the floor--the business of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2606-S2607] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY Mr. REID.

he has called undocumented immigrants criminals and rapists. donald trump has watched republicans deny the existence of climate change, and he is following in their footsteps. he would rather believe in crackpot conspiracy theories than accept climate change. it is real, but this is what he said about climate change: ``the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make united states manufacturing noncompetitive.'' try that one on. that is a direct quote. that kind of harebrained thinking has no place in the white house, but sadly it is not far from the anti-science climate change denial that is now republican party doctrine. on nearly every issue, donald trump has simply adopted the positions of the modern republican party. through their obstruction and anti- obama politics, senator mcconnell and republican leaders constructed donald trump's presidential campaign and his platform piece by piece. he is the nominee of the republican party, and he is the nominee the republican leaders deserve. now the republican party is his. republicans want trump to be their standard bearer. they are scrambling to get behind this hate-spewing nominee. there is no better example of republicans marching lockstep with trump than the supreme court vacancy. the republican national committee is trying to bring their party together by promising this dangerous man will appoint justices to the supreme court. republicans say they want their misogynistic, anti-women, anti-latino, anti-middle class billionaire to determine the balance of the supreme court for the next generation. republican senators say they trust the judgment of a man who mocks our veterans, belittles john mccain as not being a war hero, and mocks americans with disabilities. they want him to fill the supreme court. it is a sad day for this country when the republican party trusts the judgment of a vile, swindling billionaire. but anyone who has been paying attention to what republicans have been doing the past 8 years should not be shocked. hillary clinton is going to be the democratic nominee. i support hillary clinton. i am not hiding from that. republican senators need to stop waffling about donald trump. not going to the convention doesn't take away the fact that he is the republican nominee. i have heard a number of republican senators say: i am not going to the convention. well, that solves the problem, doesn't it? republican senators need to say whether they are going to vote for this guy. the republican party's chickens have come home to roost in the form of donald j. trump. mr. president, i ask the presiding officer to announce--i see senator alexander, the senior senator from tennessee, on the floor--the business of the day. ____________________",6229

CREC-2016-05-09-pt1-PgS2608,CREC-2016-05-09,114,ZIKA VIRUS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2608-S2609] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ZIKA VIRUS Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to give an update. The Zika virus is raging. It is certainly raging in Puerto Rico. It is expanding greatly in this country, and the State with the most infected cases is my State of Florida. I have been on this floor many times asking for the President's request of $1.9 billion to attack the Zika virus. About $800 million of that is, No. 1, to replace the Ebola emergency fund, which they have raided since the Congress has not given them the funding in order to try to get at the problem to begin with, which is somewhere around $500 million to $550 million. They need another $225 million to increase Medicaid in Puerto Rico, where it is now estimated that by the end of the year, 25 percent of the population of Puerto Rico--25 percent--will be infected because that is where this mosquito--called the aegypti mosquito--that transmits the virus is raging, but beware, especially as we are going into the warm summer months, this aegypti mosquito is all over the Southern United States. Anyplace that is hot, humid, and where there is rain--because rainwater will not all dissipate. It may be in a bottle cap. It may be in a dishpan. It may be in a birdbath. Where there is stagnant water, that mosquito will lay its larva, and that is the breeding ground to hatch the aegypti. About 1\1/2\ weeks ago, when we were here before the recess, there were approximately 1,000 cases reported in the United States, which included 570 in Puerto Rico and 94 in Florida. Now, just a little over a week later, it is already up to 1,133 cases across the country--up to 629 in Puerto Rico and 107 in my State. Just today, two more cases were reported by the Department of Health in the State of Florida. The bottom line is, the virus is spreading, and it is spreading quickly. Not only is it spreading, but the CDC confirmed the first Zika-related death of a 70-year-old man who died of complications in Puerto Rico. Over the break, I met with a group of Puerto Rican leaders in Florida. Basically, Puerto Rico does not have the [[Page S2609]] resources it needs to provide protection from the virus. I was just talking to Senator Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, about getting the financial crisis addressed in Puerto Rico. We can see how that is spilling over into not being able to attack the Zika crisis where it is raging out of control because of the transmission in Puerto Rico by these mosquitos. Out of the 3.5 million population of Puerto Ricans on the island, it is estimated by the CDC that 800,000 of them could be infected by the end of this year. So that U.S. territory--remember, they are American citizens. These are fellow Americans who are in trouble--is struggling under the weight of crippling debt in the financial crisis, and we haven't helped them yet. They have a Medicaid Program that is capped and it is running out of cash. The physician shortage is getting worse. What is happening is that because of the financial problems, the professionals--the doctors and lawyers and nurses, especially those in health care--because they cannot get compensated, they are leaving the island and going to the mainland. As a matter of fact, it is estimated that something between 85,000 and 100,000 may be leaving the island this year, coming to the mainland United States. The benefit is that a lot of those professionals are coming to Florida, but look at the gaping hole in health care that is leaving for the island. It seems to me that as Senators, it is our duty to protect our fellow Americans and curb the spread of this virus now. So I have introduced what the administration requested. I have had Senators say we have not given a plan for the $1.9 billion. I have given the plan over and over until this Senator is blue in the face. There is a specific breakout that I have entered into the Record several times, the last of which was when we were last in session 1\1/2\ weeks ago. The bill has 35 cosponsors, but unfortunately there is not one Republican Senator who is a cosponsor. It doesn't make sense. The spread of the Zika virus is not a partisan issue, and yet it seems to have been characterized that way. I urge our colleagues to come together on this for the good of the American people. For their health and safety, let's approve this $1.9 billion emergency request. This is the same kind of emergency funding request that would be in the aftermath of an earthquake, a hurricane, or some other natural disaster. It has now affected the American people. It is an awful virus, and we need to get at it and stop it before it is too late. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2608-S2609] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ZIKA VIRUS Mr. NELSON.

CREC-2016-05-09-pt1-PgS2607-3,CREC-2016-05-09,114,REMEMBERING BOB BENNETT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2607-S2608] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING BOB BENNETT Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the memory of a humble statesman and an adored colleague and a dear friend, Senator Bob Bennett. Bob passed away peacefully in his house last week with his wife and children gathered around him by his bedside. In the wake of his passing, the Bennett family has witnessed an outpouring of love as thousands of individuals from across the country have reached out to pay their respects to a man who served selflessly to the very end of his service here. To the many expressions of love and admiration that have already been offered in Bob's honor, I wish to add a few words of my own. I had the distinct privilege of serving alongside Bob Bennett for nearly two decades as we jointly represented our beloved State of Utah here in the United States Senate. During the many years of our service together, Bob became more than a respected partner; he was a trusted confidante and a cherished friend. In this Chamber, Senator Bennett was widely revered as a wise and thoughtful leader committed to finding innovative solutions to the most difficult challenges of the day. But above all else, he was a passionate fighter for the people of Utah, who were always foremost in his mind. I have never met someone so committed to his constituency as Senator Bennett was to the people of Utah. It is no exaggeration to say that every Utahn has benefited from Bob's public service. You cannot ride the train, take public transportation, or drive on the freeway in our State without seeing the fruits of Bob's labor in the Senate. As Utah faced unprecedented expansion and economic growth, Senator Bennett worked tirelessly to ensure that our State's infrastructure kept pace with the demands of a booming population. Were it not for Bob and the indispensable role he played in securing much needed funding for these transportation projects in Utah, our State would not be the prime destination for business, entrepreneurship, and innovation that it is today. I need not rehearse all of Senator Bennett's accomplishments in the Senate because his public legacy speaks for itself. The TRAX and FrontRunner public transportation systems in Utah are perhaps the most tangible symbols of that legacy, but there are plenty more. I join all Utahns in thanking Senator Bennett for his many years of loyal service to the Beehive State. We love him, and we will miss him dearly. In addition to fighting tirelessly for the people of Utah, Senator Bennett exercised remarkable prudence as an appropriator and provided principal leadership on the Banking Committee and as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. He was a talented lawmaker, skilled at forging consensus and reaching compromise without sacrificing his core conservative values. Over the 18 years that Senator Bennett served in this Chamber, he consistently demonstrated sound judgment and strong leadership. In a short time, he gained the trust of his Republican colleagues, who considered him a trusted resource on matters of strategy and policy. After seeing Bob's rapport with other legislators, then-Senate majority leader Bill Frist asked him to serve on the leadership team. Senator Bennett also served in leadership positions alongside Majority Leader McConnell, with whom he shared a deep and meaningful friendship. While Senator Bennett was well known for his quiet, contemplative demeanor, he was also regarded as an orator--a good one. He came frequently to the floor to engage his colleagues on the most complex issues of the day. He was exceptionally articulate, speaking with an eloquence and ease that reflected the brilliance of a well-cultivated mind. Whether he was giving a public address or holding a private conversation, Bob could explain even the most complicated policies in simple, understandable terms. He was a preeminent communicator whose talents will be sorely missed. Mr. President, up to this point, I have spoken at length about how Senator Bennett will be remembered as a public figure, but I also wish to speak about how I will remember him as a personal friend. Bob Bennett was one of the most humble men I have ever met. In a Chamber teaming with outsized egos and rampant self-importance, Bob stood apart. He always eschewed the spotlight and never esteemed himself above anyone else. On some days, you could even find him riding the Metro in to work. When a staffer asked him why [[Page S2608]] we opted for public transportation instead of a personal driver, Bob simply said: ``Because the Metro is more convenient.'' This anecdote is indicative of Bob's character. He resisted the trappings of public office and truly saw himself as a servant of the people. Perhaps more importantly, he never let the office of Senator define him. Maybe that is because he came to Congress with such a rich and varied background. Prior to his work here, Bob had already served as a Mormon military chaplain, a congressional liaison with the Nixon administration, a public relations director for billionaire Howard Hughes, and as the chief executive officer of FranklinCovey. For Bob, being a Senator was never something that was central to his personal identity; it was merely a job title that allowed him to serve others in a greater capacity. Allow me to share a simple story that illustrates Bob's humility and willingness to serve. Many years ago, Bob befriended a blind couple in his local Mormon congregation. Every single Sunday, Bob would pay the couple a personal visit, drive them to church, and stay by their side for the duration of meetings--always ready and always eager to help. For Bob, faithfully serving this elderly couple was just as important as fulfilling his duties in the Senate. That, Mr. President, is heartfelt humility and love unfeigned. I often wondered what it was that enabled Bob to serve so selflessly. I believe the answer is simple: It was his faith in and love for Jesus Christ, whom he looked to as a model of servant leadership. Bob believed in the Christian teaching that when you are in the service of your fellow men and women, you are only in the service of your God. This belief animated his service until the very end. For as long as Bob was physically able, he was an active volunteer in his church congregation. In fact, just 3 weeks ago he hosted a doctrinal discussion with dozens of Latter-day Saints seeking to build their faith. In this meeting, Bob bore testimony of Jesus Christ and his perfect example of love and sacrifice. The next day, Bob suffered a stroke and was admitted to the hospital for the last time. Both in public office and in private life, Bob Bennett was a model of selfless service. We were blessed by his work in the Senate and will continue to benefit from his example of humble leadership. I pray that we might always remember Bob's humility and kindness and seek to emulate these qualities ourselves as we work together to overcome the challenges facing our country. Mr. President, having said all of that, Bob was very fortunate to have Joyce as his companion. She is a terrific human being, very talented--a flute instructor, a tremendous flutist. He has wonderful children, each one of whom has made contributions in our society that are exemplary. His friends will always remember Bob as somebody who really accomplished a lot in his life as well as the lives of many thousands of people around him. I personally am deeply grateful for the kindness he showed to me, the friendship we had together, and the privilege I had of serving with him. I will miss Bob very much, and I think all of us who knew him well will miss him. He was truly a great example. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments about Senator Bennett; and then I will yield the floor to Senator Nelson, who has another schedule; and then, for the information of Senators and staff, I will make some comments on how we are going to proceed on the Energy and Water bill, which I hope we can wrap up pretty quickly, but I will wait until Senator Nelson finishes. Mr. President, I am glad I had a chance to hear the majority leader, Senator McConnell, as well as Senator Reid and Senator Hatch, all of whom were great friends of Bob Bennett, as was I. Bob Bennett came to Washington with his father Wallace Bennett, who was a U.S. Senator. He was in the Senate when I first came here as a Senate aide. I first met Bob nearly 50 years ago, when we, in effect, both worked for Bryce Harlow, who was President Nixon's Chief of Congressional Relations. Mr. Harlow, who is revered in Washington still, would have Saturday morning meetings with all of those of us who had the job of being congressional liaisons with Members of Congress. Bob Bennett was in the Transportation Department, and I was Mr. Harlow's assistant and telephone answerer in the White House at the time. We got to know each other then. We have known each other ever since. He and his wife Joyce visited with us in our home in Tennessee and we traveled with them and worked together on a variety of issues. They became very special friends. He was chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, to which Senator Hatch referred, which had so much to do with his home State of Utah. He handled that with great diligence and great effectiveness for a number of years. That is the bill we are working on today in the Senate. I will be at his service tomorrow, as will other Senators. I simply wanted to add my voice to those of the majority leader, the Democratic leader, and his colleague Senator Hatch in saying we all greatly admired Bob. He served our Nation brilliantly and well and eloquently. I heard his farewell address. It was one of the best I have ever heard. I remember one of the things he said: The great value as a Senator is that you not only have a say, you have a vote. Bob Bennett had a lot to say, he cast a lot of votes, and a lot of us listened very carefully to what he had to say and greatly respected his votes. We have lost a great friend, and Utah and our country lost a great public servant. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I will talk about the Zika virus, but I want to first add a comment about Senator Bob Bennett. A gentleman's gentleman, a legislator's legislator, a Senator who would reach across the aisle in order to get the workable consensus in order to get something done. Doesn't that sound like the type of person we need in the Congress today in order to confront the issues we are facing? I was saddened to hear the news he had passed on. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2607-S2608] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING BOB BENNETT Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the memory of a humble statesman and an adored colleague and a dear friend, Senator Bob Bennett. Bob passed away peacefully in his house last week with his wife and children gathered around him by his bedside. In the wake of his passing, the Bennett family has witnessed an outpouring of love as thousands of individuals from across the country have reached out to pay their respects to a man who served selflessly to the very end of his service here. To the many expressions of love and admiration that have already been offered in Bob's honor, I wish to add a few words of my own. I had the distinct privilege of serving alongside Bob Bennett for nearly two decades as we jointly represented our beloved State of Utah here in the United States Senate. During the many years of our service together, Bob became more than a respected partner; he was a trusted confidante and a cherished friend. In this Chamber, Senator Bennett was widely revered as a wise and thoughtful leader committed to finding innovative solutions to the most difficult challenges of the day. But above all else, he was a passionate fighter for the people of Utah, who were always foremost in his mind.

it was merely a job title that allowed him to serve others in a greater capacity. allow me to share a simple story that illustrates bob's humility and willingness to serve. many years ago, bob befriended a blind couple in his local mormon congregation. every single sunday, bob would pay the couple a personal visit, drive them to church, and stay by their side for the duration of meetings--always ready and always eager to help. for bob, faithfully serving this elderly couple was just as important as fulfilling his duties in the senate. that, mr. president, is heartfelt humility and love unfeigned. i often wondered what it was that enabled bob to serve so selflessly. i believe the answer is simple: it was his faith in and love for jesus christ, whom he looked to as a model of servant leadership. bob believed in the christian teaching that when you are in the service of your fellow men and women, you are only in the service of your god. this belief animated his service until the very end. for as long as bob was physically able, he was an active volunteer in his church congregation. in fact, just 3 weeks ago he hosted a doctrinal discussion with dozens of latter-day saints seeking to build their faith. in this meeting, bob bore testimony of jesus christ and his perfect example of love and sacrifice. the next day, bob suffered a stroke and was admitted to the hospital for the last time. both in public office and in private life, bob bennett was a model of selfless service. we were blessed by his work in the senate and will continue to benefit from his example of humble leadership. i pray that we might always remember bob's humility and kindness and seek to emulate these qualities ourselves as we work together to overcome the challenges facing our country. mr. president, having said all of that, bob was very fortunate to have joyce as his companion. she is a terrific human being, very talented--a flute instructor, a tremendous flutist. he has wonderful children, each one of whom has made contributions in our society that are exemplary. his friends will always remember bob as somebody who really accomplished a lot in his life as well as the lives of many thousands of people around him. i personally am deeply grateful for the kindness he showed to me, the friendship we had together, and the privilege i had of serving with him. i will miss bob very much, and i think all of us who knew him well will miss him. he was truly a great example. with that, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from tennessee. mr. alexander. mr. president, i wish to make a few comments about senator bennett; and then i will yield the floor to senator nelson, who has another schedule; and then, for the information of senators and staff, i will make some comments on how we are going to proceed on the energy and water bill, which i hope we can wrap up pretty quickly, but i will wait until senator nelson finishes. mr. president, i am glad i had a chance to hear the majority leader, senator mcconnell, as well as senator reid and senator hatch, all of whom were great friends of bob bennett, as was i. bob bennett came to washington with his father wallace bennett, who was a u.s. senator. he was in the senate when i first came here as a senate aide. i first met bob nearly 50 years ago, when we, in effect, both worked for bryce harlow, who was president nixon's chief of congressional relations. mr. harlow, who is revered in washington still, would have saturday morning meetings with all of those of us who had the job of being congressional liaisons with members of congress. bob bennett was in the transportation department, and i was mr. harlow's assistant and telephone answerer in the white house at the time. we got to know each other then. we have known each other ever since. he and his wife joyce visited with us in our home in tennessee and we traveled with them and worked together on a variety of issues. they became very special friends. he was chairman of the energy and water subcommittee, to which senator hatch referred, which had so much to do with his home state of utah. he handled that with great diligence and great effectiveness for a number of years. that is the bill we are working on today in the senate. i will be at his service tomorrow, as will other senators. i simply wanted to add my voice to those of the majority leader, the democratic leader, and his colleague senator hatch in saying we all greatly admired bob. he served our nation brilliantly and well and eloquently. i heard his farewell address. it was one of the best i have ever heard. i remember one of the things he said: the great value as a senator is that you not only have a say, you have a vote. bob bennett had a lot to say, he cast a lot of votes, and a lot of us listened very carefully to what he had to say and greatly respected his votes. we have lost a great friend, and utah and our country lost a great public servant. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from florida. mr. nelson. mr. president, i will talk about the zika virus, but i want to first add a comment about senator bob bennett. a gentleman's gentleman, a legislator's legislator, a senator who would reach across the aisle in order to get the workable consensus in order to get something done. doesn't that sound like the type of person we need in the congress today in order to confront the issues we are facing? i was saddened to hear the news he had passed on. ____________________",10900
CREC-2016-05-09-pt1-PgS2609,CREC-2016-05-09,114,ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2609-S2611] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, for the information of Senators and staff members, I would like to make a few comments about the Energy and Water appropriations bill that we will be moving to at 4 this afternoon. Senator Feinstein is in an intelligence briefing and will be here about 4 as we will. We will have more to say at that time, but here is my view of where we are: At 5:30 today, the Senate, for the third time, will vote on whether it is time to cut off debate and finish the bill. The first two votes failed, and they failed for one reason. They failed because of differences of opinion about the amendment by the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Cotton, which said that in the year 2017, the United States could not use tax dollars to buy heavy water from Iran as we are doing in 2016. So we will vote for the third time today on whether to cut off debate and finish the bill. Here is what I would suggest our goal should be. This is just my opinion, but I have talked with the majority leader, the Democratic, and I have talked with Senator Feinstein and a number of other Senators. No. 1, we should dispose of the Cotton amendment the way we normally dispose of issues about which we disagree. We should vote on them. That is what we do in the Senate--we vote. If you are in the Grand Ole Opry, you sing. So we have a difference of opinion about the Cotton amendment. Let's vote on it. It is relevant to the bill. It is properly filed. It is germane. Senator Cotton has been very flexible. He has offered to decide it in many different ways. He has offered to modify his amendment. He has offered to allow it to be considered separately. He has offered for us to vote at a 60-vote level, and then he would withdraw it if he should lose. He has offered to vote it at 60 votes on cloture on his amendment. So he has offered us an opportunity to vote on his amendment in many different ways. He just wants a vote. In my view, a Senator who has a relevant and germane amendment is entitled to a vote, and I am supporting his right to a vote. Then, once we vote on the amendment and dispose of it, we should finish the bill. So I am optimistic. I see no reason why today or tomorrow--certainly no later than Wednesday--we cannot vote on and dispose of the Cotton amendment and vote on and finish the Energy and Water appropriations bill. So I say to Senators and staff members, if I were planning my week, I would plan on there being a vote on the Cotton amendment. Now, they may ask how I know that. Well, I know this: that any majority leader has the right to file cloture on an amendment like the Cotton amendment, and by Wednesday we will vote on it at 60 votes. My own view is, since we are basically finished with the bill, except for the Cotton amendment, why would we not agree to wrap up things and do it tomorrow or even today? We could finish the bill today, with a vote on the Cotton amendment at 60 votes, with a vote on cloture, and a vote on final passage. As much as I defend the right of the Senator from Arkansas to have a vote, I am going to oppose his amendment on the merits, which I will describe in just a minute, but it is time to bring this bill to a conclusion. I think most Senators agree with that, and that is what we need to do. Let me discuss for a moment, remind Senators and those listening, why this bill is so important. As the majority leader says, it covers a lot of essential services in this country. For example, every time there is a flood in the Midwest, 15 or 20 Senators show up wanting more money for flood control. Our inland waterways are in need of reconstruction. The harbors on the west coast and in Charleston, Mobile, and many other places need deepening. We need to stay No. 1 in supercomputing in the world. About half of this legislation has to do with our nuclear weapons program--modernizing it and keeping us safe. All 17 of our National Laboratories are in the Office of Science under this legislation. Despite staying within strict budget limits, we have agreed to the highest level of appropriations for our Office of Science, out of which comes so much of our economic growth, of any appropriations bill in history. In addition to that, we have gone through a very careful process. About 80 different Members of the Senate have come to Senator Feinstein and me with policy changes that they would like to see in the bill that are in the bill. Eighty means about half Republicans and half Democrats. I know that it is important to them because I have already heard reports of many Senators being home last weekend taking credit for all of these provisions they have gotten in the bill, which we haven't passed yet. I don't blame them for that. There are a lot of provisions in this bill that are important to the country and important to my State of Tennessee. I am reminding Senators that this is an important bill in which they have had a lot of say. In addition, on the floor, we have already processed 17 different amendments--about as many Democratic amendments as Republican amendments. We did all of that in a matter of 3 or 4 days before we reached an impasse on the Cotton amendment. We are basically done with step one of our most basic constitutional work, which is oversight and appropriations of about $1 trillion in spending. This is the first of 12 bills. This Energy and Water appropriations bill has not gone across the floor in regular order since 2009. It is time we do that. We are very close to doing that. Let me say a word about the amendment by the Senator from Arkansas. As I said, I have, for the last week, defended his right to have a vote, and he will have a vote. Make no mistake about it, he will have a vote, but I intend to oppose it on the merits for [[Page S2610]] three reasons. The first is this, and let me say this very carefully: If the United States is not allowed to buy heavy water from Iran next year as it is this year, it creates the possibility that Iran will be able to sell that heavy water to other countries, including North Korea, which might use it to make nuclear weapons. Let me say that again. If we are not allowed to buy it by this amendment, someone else will buy it. Heavy water is a distilled form of water. By itself, it is not hazardous. It is not radioactive. It can be used for many peaceful purposes. The United States uses about 70 tons of it every year. For example, this year the Oak Ridge National Laboratory is buying 32 tons from Iran--6 tons of which we will be used for its big neutron microscope. The rest will be sold over time to universities, to hospitals, to manufacturers for medical research, for fiber optics--all for peaceful purposes. This heavy water--this distilled form of water--can also be used to make plutonium to make nuclear weapons, which is why we do not want Iran to have it. We want it out of Iran. We want it somewhere else. If we don't want them to have it, and if we need it and we in the United States don't produce it and we don't buy it, what does Iran do with its heavy water? It sells it to somebody else, perhaps. We don't know who, but it could be any one of a number of countries, including North Korea. In a big meeting over there now--the biggest they have had in three decades--they are talking about nuclear weapons. Respectfully, in my view, this is bad policy. I oppose it. I support the Senator's right to have a vote, and he will have a vote, but when we have that vote, I will vote no. The second reason I oppose the amendment is it doesn't belong on the appropriations bill. The Senator has a right to have it on there, but I hear a lot of lectures of us appropriators in our Republican lunches from distinguished members of our so-called authorizing committees-- committees such as Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intelligence-- saying: You Senators on the Appropriations Committee are making a lot of decisions you shouldn't be making. We should be making the policy decisions. What is more of a policy decision than what to do with Iran's heavy water? This isn't a debate about whether you support the Iran nuclear agreement. I voted against that. I am opposed to that. This is a question about what do you do about the 200 tons of heavy water that can be used either for peaceful purposes or to make nuclear weapons over the next few years. I would think there would be no issue that would be more suitable for discussion by the Foreign Relations Committee or the Armed Services Committee or the Intelligence Committee, nor can I think of many issues less suitable just to pop up as an amendment on an appropriations bill. If we can't decide issues like this that are filled with national security implications, why do we have a Foreign Relations Committee? Why do we have an Armed Services Committee? Why do we have an Intelligence Committee? It is not just the possibility that it might go to Iran, the issue cuts the other way as well. Senator Cotton or someone else who favors the amendment might say: Well, if we buy more heavy water from Iran, perhaps that creates a market for Iran. Maybe that incentivizes them to make more heavy water and keeps them in production for a long period of time. Then, later on, they misuse it. Maybe that is possible. Then there is the question of what effect a decision by the United States to not allow our tax dollars to buy heavy water for our peaceful purposes have on other countries that produce heavy waters, such as India, such as Argentina or Canada, which doesn't now produce it but uses it. What are the implications? At this time, when there has never been a more dangerous recent time in the world, what are the national security implications of what to do about Iran's disposal of heavy water--water we don't want it to have, water we don't produce but which we need, and water we do not want to get into the hands of other countries, such as perhaps North Korea, which could use it to make nuclear weapons. I cannot think of a more appropriate issue to be considered by the Foreign Relations Committee. There is a third reason we should take into account when voting on this. The President says he will veto it. I will say more about Presidential vetoes in a minute. I don't think we should pull the cord and stop the train just because the President says he will veto something. The White House has said they will veto something 85 times in the last year and a half. If we stopped our work every time they did that, we would only be meeting on Monday afternoons or Tuesday mornings. But we ought to take into account the fact that the President might veto it, and placing this amendment on this bill would be a sincere but in my opinion a futile gesture because we would end up with no amendment after the Presidential veto. We might end up with no Energy and Water appropriations bill for yet another year. I have some differences with some of my friends on the other side. Some of them think that whenever the President says veto, we should stop. I don't agree with that. I think we should go ahead. If he wants to veto, he vetoes, but I think we should take that into account. Some of them say that whenever a controversial amendment comes up, we should not move forward with the bill. Here is what we agreed to this year. After last year, I agreed, anyway, to make sure we did not in the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee--and I see the Senator from California is here, which we worked on together. We kept controversial amendments off the bill in our subcommittee. There were a number that tried to come on. We said, if they are controversial, bring them to the floor. Last year on that bill went the waters of the United States amendment, and it killed the bill. The Democrats wouldn't move forward with it. I thought they should have, but they did not. It was not on the bill this year. Senator Hoeven held it until we got to the floor. He offered the amendment at 60 votes and it didn't pass. We honored our word. We kept the controversial amendments off the bill in committee, but amendments that are relevant and germane when they come to the floor are entitled to be heard. We should dispose of the Cotton amendment the way we dispose of our other differences. We should just vote on it. Especially since the Senator from California is here, let me talk about another aspect of our work on the bill that is important in the Senate; that is, the word ``restraint.'' For example, Senator Feinstein is very concerned about the cruise missile. She could have offered an amendment in the subcommittee or she could have today that would have made a major change in our policy toward the cruise missile, but she chose not to do that. She chose instead to have a hearing. We will do that, and then we will take the next step, whatever that turns out to be. She knows, if she had moved ahead with that, that would have been a very provocative thing to do, made it harder to pass the bill. She chose not to do it. The Senators from South Carolina, Mr. Graham and Mr. Scott, are very concerned about the plutonium MOX facility in South Carolina. The administration has recommended that we close it and move to a different way of disposing of that plutonium. Senator Feinstein and I agree with that. We could have tried to make that policy decision in this bill or the South Carolina Senators could have tried that, too, but we thought it was a policy decision that should first be considered by the authorizing committee--in this case, the Armed Services Committee. We met with the representatives of Senator McCain and Senator Reed, and they have agreed to have a hearing. This is how we are dealing with that. Senator Shelby, from Alabama, is highly stirred up about what we call the Georgia-Florida-Alabama water wars. He would like to have his amendment to resolve that problem on this bill, but he has stepped back from that on this bill and allowed us to move ahead with it. None of those Senators had to do that, but they did that knowing that it is the basic constitutional duty of this body to do its appropriations work, and they made it possible. I would have preferred Senator Cotton not offer this amendment on this bill, but he did. [[Page S2611]] Since it is relevant and since it is germane and since we did not deal with it in committee, I think the right way to approach it is to say: Let's dispose of it the way we dispose of other differences of opinion. Let's vote on it and let's move on. If I may say through the Chair, before Senator Feinstein came, I said, in my view, I wanted the Senators and staff to know we would be voting today for the third time on whether to cut off debate, and my hope was that we could dispose of the Cotton amendment at 60 votes and we could then finish the bill. I also said that while I defended Senator Cotton's right to offer the amendment and that he will get a vote--because the majority leader has the parliamentary tools to file cloture and make sure there is a vote on the Cotton amendment by Wednesday--I intend to vote against the Cotton amendment because I think it risks the possibility that Iran's heavy water might be sold to a country, such as North Korea, that could use it to make nuclear weapons. I think first it should be considered by the Foreign Relations Committee or the Armed Services Committee or the Intelligence Committee. For those reasons, I intend to vote against it. I am hopeful that when we get to 5:30, maybe conversations would continue, and the possibility could even exist that we could agree today to vote on the Cotton amendment at 60 votes, dispose of it, vote on cloture to move ahead with the bill, and have final passage of the bill. If we can't do that, I see no reason we can't do it over the next couple of days. I thank the Senator from California for the way she has worked with me on this issue. We have gotten almost to the finish line. She and I would like to set a good example for the other 11 appropriations bills that are coming up. There are other bills beyond that which we need to deal with, such as the 21st-century cures legislation on biomedical research, and there is the Zika legislation that many Senators are interested in. My hope is that we will find a way to resolve the only major issue that remains so we can pass a bill that virtually every Senator in this body has some interest in and will probably vote for. I am optimistic and hopeful that we can move quickly on disposing of the Cotton amendment so we can finish the bill. Ideally we would do it today, but we can certainly get it done by tomorrow or Wednesday. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2609-S2611] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL Mr. ALEXANDER.

The Senator has a right to have it on there, but I hear a lot of lectures of us appropriators in our Republican lunches from distinguished members of our so-called authorizing committees-- committees such as Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intelligence-- saying: You Senators on the Appropriations Committee are making a lot of decisions you shouldn't be making. We should be making the policy decisions. What is more of a policy decision than what to do with Iran's heavy water? This isn't a debate about whether you support the Iran nuclear agreement. I voted against that. I am opposed to that. This is a question about what do you do about the 200 tons of heavy water that can be used either for peaceful purposes or to make nuclear weapons over the next few years. I would think there would be no issue that would be more suitable for discussion by the Foreign Relations Committee or the Armed Services Committee or the Intelligence Committee, nor can I think of many issues less suitable just to pop up as an amendment on an appropriations bill. If we can't decide issues like this that are filled with national security implications, why do we have a Foreign Relations Committee? Why do we have an Armed Services Committee? Why do we have an Intelligence Committee? It is not just the possibility that it might go to Iran, the issue cuts the other way as well. Senator Cotton or someone else who favors the amendment might say: Well, if we buy more heavy water from Iran, perhaps that creates a market for Iran. Maybe that incentivizes them to make more heavy water and keeps them in production for a long period of time. Then, later on, they misuse it. Maybe that is possible. Then there is the question of what effect a decision by the United States to not allow our tax dollars to buy heavy water for our peaceful purposes have on other countries that produce heavy waters, such as India, such as Argentina or Canada, which doesn't now produce it but uses it. What are the implications? At this time, when there has never been a more dangerous recent time in the world, what are the national security implications of what to do about Iran's disposal of heavy water--water we don't want it to have, water we don't produce but which we need, and water we do not want to get into the hands of other countries, such as perhaps North Korea, which could use it to make nuclear weapons. I cannot think of a more appropriate issue to be considered by the Foreign Relations Committee. There is a third reason we should take into account when voting on this. The President says he will veto it. I will say more about Presidential vetoes in a minute. I don't think we should pull the cord and stop the train just because the President says he will veto something. The White House has said they will veto something 85 times in the last year and a half. If we stopped our work every time they did that, we would only be meeting on Monday afternoons or Tuesday mornings. But we ought to take into account the fact that the President might veto it, and placing this amendment on this bill would be a sincere but in my opinion a futile gesture because we would end up with no amendment after the Presidential veto. We might end up with no Energy and Water appropriations bill for yet another year. I have some differences with some of my friends on the other side. Some of them think that whenever the President says veto, we should stop. I don't agree with that. I think we should go ahead. If he wants to veto, he vetoes, but I think we should take that into account. Some of them say that whenever a controversial amendment comes up, we should not move forward with the bill. Here is what we agreed to this year. After last year, I agreed, anyway, to make sure we did not in the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee--and I see the Senator from California is here, which we worked on together. We kept controversial amendments off the bill in our subcommittee. There were a number that tried to come on. We said, if they are controversial, bring them to the floor. Last year on that bill went the waters of the United States amendment, and it killed the bill. The Democrats wouldn't move forward with it. I thought they should have, but they did not. It was not on the bill this year. Senator Hoeven held it until we got to the floor. He offered the amendment at 60 votes and it didn't pass. We honored our word. We kept the controversial amendments off the bill in committee, but amendments that are relevant and germane when they come to the floor are entitled to be heard. We should dispose of the Cotton amendment the way we dispose of our other differences. We should just vote on it. Especially since the Senator from California is here, let me talk about another aspect of our work on the bill that is important in the Senate; that is, the word ``restraint.'' For example, Senator Feinstein is very concerned about the cruise missile. She could have offered an amendment in the subcommittee or she could have today that would have made a major change in our policy toward the cruise missile, but she chose not to do that. She chose instead to have a hearing. We will do that, and then we will take the next step, whatever that turns out to be. She knows, if she had moved ahead with that, that would have been a very provocative thing to do, made it harder to pass the bill. She chose not to do it. The Senators from South Carolina, Mr. Graham and Mr. Scott, are very concerned about the plutonium MOX facility in South Carolina. The administration has recommended that we close it and move to a different way of disposing of that plutonium. Senator Feinstein and I agree with that. We could have tried to make that policy decision in this bill or the South Carolina Senators could have tried that, too, but we thought it was a policy decision that should first be considered by the authorizing committee--in this case, the Armed Services Committee. We met with the representatives of Senator McCain and Senator Reed, and they have agreed to have a hearing. This is how we are dealing with that. Senator Shelby, from Alabama, is highly stirred up about what we call the Georgia-Florida-Alabama water wars. He would like to have his amendment to resolve that problem on this bill, but he has stepped back from that on this bill and allowed us to move ahead with it. None of those Senators had to do that, but they did that knowing that it is the basic constitutional duty of this body to do its appropriations work, and they made it possible. I would have preferred Senator Cotton not offer this amendment on this bill, but he did. [[Page S2611]] Since it is relevant and since it is germane and since we did not deal with it in committee, I think the right way to approach it is to say: Let's dispose of it the way we dispose of other differences of opinion. Let's vote on it and let's move on. If I may say through the Chair, before Senator Feinstein came, I said, in my view, I wanted the Senators and staff to know we would be voting today for the third time on whether to cut off debate, and my hope was that we could dispose of the Cotton amendment at 60 votes and we could then finish the bill. I also said that while I defended Senator Cotton's right to offer the amendment and that he will get a vote--because the majority leader has the parliamentary tools to file cloture and make sure there is a vote on the Cotton amendment by Wednesday--I intend to vote against the Cotton amendment because I think it risks the possibility that Iran's heavy water might be sold to a country, such as North Korea, that could use it to make nuclear weapons. I think first it should be considered by the Foreign Relations Committee or the Armed Services Committee or the Intelligence Committee. For those reasons, I intend to vote against it. I am hopeful that when we get to 5:30, maybe conversations would continue, and the possibility could even exist that we could agree today to vote on the Cotton amendment at 60 votes, dispose of it, vote on cloture to move ahead with the bill, and have final passage of the bill. If we can't do that, I see no reason we can't do it over the next couple of days. I thank the Senator from California for the way she has worked with me on this issue. We have gotten almost to the finish line. She and I would like to set a good example for the other 11 appropriations bills that are coming up. There are other bills beyond that which we need to deal with, such as the 21st-century cures legislation on biomedical research, and there is the Zika legislation that many Senators are interested in. My hope is that we will find a way to resolve the only major issue that remains so we can pass a bill that virtually every Senator in this body has some interest in and will probably vote for. I am optimistic and hopeful that we can move quickly on disposing of the Cotton amendment so we can finish the bill. Ideally we would do it today, but we can certainly get it done by tomorrow or Wednesday. I yield the floor. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2609-S2611] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, for the information of Senators and staff members, I would like to make a few comments about the Energy and Water appropriations bill that we will be moving to at 4 this afternoon. Senator Feinstein is in an intelligence briefing and will be here about 4 as we will. We will have more to say at that time, but here is my view of where we are: At 5:30 today, the Senate, for the third time, will vote on whether it is time to cut off debate and finish the bill. The first two votes failed, and they failed for one reason. They failed because of differences of opinion about the amendment by the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Cotton, which said that in the year 2017, the United States could not use tax dollars to buy heavy water from Iran as we are doing in 2016. So we will vote for the third time today on whether to cut off debate and finish the bill. Here is what I would suggest our goal should be. This is just my opinion, but I have talked with the majority leader, the Democratic, and I have talked with Senator Feinstein and a number of other Senators. No. 1, we should dispose of the Cotton amendment the way we normally dispose of issues about which we disagree. We should vote on them. That is what we do in the Senate--we vote. If you are in the Grand Ole Opry, you sing. So we have a difference of opinion about the Cotton amendment. Let's vote on it. It is relevant to the bill. It is properly filed. It is germane. Senator Cotton has been very flexible. He has offered to decide it in many different ways. He has offered to modify his amendment. He has offered to allow it to be considered separately. He has offered for us to vote at a 60-vote level, and then he would withdraw it if he should lose. He has offered to vote it at 60 votes on cloture on his amendment. So he has offered us an opportunity to vote on his amendment in many different ways. He just wants a vote. In my view, a Senator who has a relevant and germane amendment is entitled to a vote, and I am supporting his right to a vote. Then, once we vote on the amendment and dispose of it, we should finish the bill. So I am optimistic. I see no reason why today or tomorrow--certainly no later than Wednesday--we cannot vote on and dispose of the Cotton amendment and vote on and finish the Energy and Water appropriations bill. So I say to Senators and staff members, if I were planning my week, I would plan on there being a vote on the Cotton amendment. Now, they may ask how I know that. Well, I know this: that any majority leader has the right to file cloture on an amendment like the Cotton amendment, and by Wednesday we will vote on it at 60 votes. My own view is, since we are basically finished with the bill, except for the Cotton amendment, why would we not agree to wrap up things and do it tomorrow or even today? We could finish the bill today, with a vote on the Cotton amendment at 60 votes, with a vote on cloture, and a vote on final passage. As much as I defend the right of the Senator from Arkansas to have a vote, I am going to oppose his amendment on the merits, which I will describe in just a minute, but it is time to bring this bill to a conclusion. I think most Senators agree with that, and that is what we need to do. Let me discuss for a moment, remind Senators and those listening, why this bill is so important. As the majority leader says, it covers a lot of essential services in this country. For example, every time there is a flood in the Midwest, 15 or 20 Senators show up wanting more money for flood control. Our inland waterways are in need of reconstruction. The harbors on the west coast and in Charleston, Mobile, and many other places need deepening. We need to stay No. 1 in supercomputing in the world. About half of this legislation has to do with our nuclear weapons program--modernizing it and keeping us safe. All 17 of our National Laboratories are in the Office of Science under this legislation. Despite staying within strict budget limits, we have agreed to the highest level of appropriations for our Office of Science, out of which comes so much of our economic growth, of any appropriations bill in history. In addition to that, we have gone through a very careful process. About 80 different Members of the Senate have come to Senator Feinstein and me with policy changes that they would like to see in the bill that are in the bill. Eighty means about half Republicans and half Democrats. I know that it is important to them because I have already heard reports of many Senators being home last weekend taking credit for all of these provisions they have gotten in the bill, which we haven't passed yet. I don't blame them for that. There are a lot of provisions in this bill that are important to the country and important to my State of Tennessee. I am reminding Senators that this is an important bill in which they have had a lot of say. In addition, on the floor, we have already processed 17 different amendments--about as many Democratic amendments as Republican amendments. We did all of that in a matter of 3 or 4 days before we reached an impasse on the Cotton amendment. We are basically done with step one of our most basic constitutional work, which is oversight and appropriations of about $1 trillion in spending. This is the first of 12 bills. This Energy and Water appropriations bill has not gone across the floor in regular order since 2009. It is time we do that. We are very close to doing that. Let me say a word about the amendment by the Senator from Arkansas. As I said, I have, for the last week, defended his right to have a vote, and he will have a vote. Make no mistake about it, he will have a vote, but I intend to oppose it on the merits for [[Page S2610]] three reasons. The first is this, and let me say this very carefully: If the United States is not allowed to buy heavy water from Iran next year as it is this year, it creates the possibility that Iran will be able to sell that heavy water to other countries, including North Korea, which might use it to make nuclear weapons. Let me say that again. If we are not allowed to buy it by this amendment, someone else will buy it. Heavy water is a distilled form of water. By itself, it is not hazardous. It is not radioactive. It can be used for many peaceful purposes. The United States uses about 70 tons of it every year. For example, this year the Oak Ridge National Laboratory is buying 32 tons from Iran--6 tons of which we will be used for its big neutron microscope. The rest will be sold over time to universities, to hospitals, to manufacturers for medical research, for fiber optics--all for peaceful purposes. This heavy water--this distilled form of water--can also be used to make plutonium to make nuclear weapons, which is why we do not want Iran to have it. We want it out of Iran. We want it somewhere else. If we don't want them to have it, and if we need it and we in the United States don't produce it and we don't buy it, what does Iran do with its heavy water? It sells it to somebody else, perhaps. We don't know who, but it could be any one of a number of countries, including North Korea. In a big meeting over there now--the biggest they have had in three decades--they are talking about nuclear weapons. Respectfully, in my view, this is bad policy. I oppose it. I support the Senator's right to have a vote, and he will have a vote, but when we have that vote, I will vote no. The second reason I oppose the amendment is it doesn't belong on the appropriations bill. The Senator has a right to have it on there, but I hear a lot of lectures of us appropriators in our Republican lunches from distinguished members of our so-called authorizing committees-- committees such as Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intelligence-- saying: You Senators on the Appropriations Committee are making a lot of decisions you shouldn't be making. We should be making the policy decisions. What is more of a policy decision than what to do with Iran's heavy water? This isn't a debate about whether you support the Iran nuclear agreement. I voted against that. I am opposed to that. This is a question about what do you do about the 200 tons of heavy water that can be used either for peaceful purposes or to make nuclear weapons over the next few years. I would think there would be no issue that would be more suitable for discussion by the Foreign Relations Committee or the Armed Services Committee or the Intelligence Committee, nor can I think of many issues less suitable just to pop up as an amendment on an appropriations bill.

why do we have an armed services committee? why do we have an intelligence committee? it is not just the possibility that it might go to iran, the issue cuts the other way as well. senator cotton or someone else who favors the amendment might say: well, if we buy more heavy water from iran, perhaps that creates a market for iran. maybe that incentivizes them to make more heavy water and keeps them in production for a long period of time. then, later on, they misuse it. maybe that is possible. then there is the question of what effect a decision by the united states to not allow our tax dollars to buy heavy water for our peaceful purposes have on other countries that produce heavy waters, such as india, such as argentina or canada, which doesn't now produce it but uses it. what are the implications? at this time, when there has never been a more dangerous recent time in the world, what are the national security implications of what to do about iran's disposal of heavy water--water we don't want it to have, water we don't produce but which we need, and water we do not want to get into the hands of other countries, such as perhaps north korea, which could use it to make nuclear weapons. i cannot think of a more appropriate issue to be considered by the foreign relations committee. there is a third reason we should take into account when voting on this. the president says he will veto it. i will say more about presidential vetoes in a minute. i don't think we should pull the cord and stop the train just because the president says he will veto something. the white house has said they will veto something 85 times in the last year and a half. if we stopped our work every time they did that, we would only be meeting on monday afternoons or tuesday mornings. but we ought to take into account the fact that the president might veto it, and placing this amendment on this bill would be a sincere but in my opinion a futile gesture because we would end up with no amendment after the presidential veto. we might end up with no energy and water appropriations bill for yet another year. i have some differences with some of my friends on the other side. some of them think that whenever the president says veto, we should stop. i don't agree with that. i think we should go ahead. if he wants to veto, he vetoes, but i think we should take that into account. some of them say that whenever a controversial amendment comes up, we should not move forward with the bill. here is what we agreed to this year. after last year, i agreed, anyway, to make sure we did not in the energy and water development subcommittee--and i see the senator from california is here, which we worked on together. we kept controversial amendments off the bill in our subcommittee. there were a number that tried to come on. we said, if they are controversial, bring them to the floor. last year on that bill went the waters of the united states amendment, and it killed the bill. the democrats wouldn't move forward with it. i thought they should have, but they did not. it was not on the bill this year. senator hoeven held it until we got to the floor. he offered the amendment at 60 votes and it didn't pass. we honored our word. we kept the controversial amendments off the bill in committee, but amendments that are relevant and germane when they come to the floor are entitled to be heard. we should dispose of the cotton amendment the way we dispose of our other differences. we should just vote on it. especially since the senator from california is here, let me talk about another aspect of our work on the bill that is important in the senate; that is, the word ``restraint.'' for example, senator feinstein is very concerned about the cruise missile. she could have offered an amendment in the subcommittee or she could have today that would have made a major change in our policy toward the cruise missile, but she chose not to do that. she chose instead to have a hearing. we will do that, and then we will take the next step, whatever that turns out to be. she knows, if she had moved ahead with that, that would have been a very provocative thing to do, made it harder to pass the bill. she chose not to do it. the senators from south carolina, mr. graham and mr. scott, are very concerned about the plutonium mox facility in south carolina. the administration has recommended that we close it and move to a different way of disposing of that plutonium. senator feinstein and i agree with that. we could have tried to make that policy decision in this bill or the south carolina senators could have tried that, too, but we thought it was a policy decision that should first be considered by the authorizing committee--in this case, the armed services committee. we met with the representatives of senator mccain and senator reed, and they have agreed to have a hearing. this is how we are dealing with that. senator shelby, from alabama, is highly stirred up about what we call the georgia-florida-alabama water wars. he would like to have his amendment to resolve that problem on this bill, but he has stepped back from that on this bill and allowed us to move ahead with it. none of those senators had to do that, but they did that knowing that it is the basic constitutional duty of this body to do its appropriations work, and they made it possible. i would have preferred senator cotton not offer this amendment on this bill, but he did. [[page s2611]] since it is relevant and since it is germane and since we did not deal with it in committee, i think the right way to approach it is to say: let's dispose of it the way we dispose of other differences of opinion. let's vote on it and let's move on. if i may say through the chair, before senator feinstein came, i said, in my view, i wanted the senators and staff to know we would be voting today for the third time on whether to cut off debate, and my hope was that we could dispose of the cotton amendment at 60 votes and we could then finish the bill. i also said that while i defended senator cotton's right to offer the amendment and that he will get a vote--because the majority leader has the parliamentary tools to file cloture and make sure there is a vote on the cotton amendment by wednesday--i intend to vote against the cotton amendment because i think it risks the possibility that iran's heavy water might be sold to a country, such as north korea, that could use it to make nuclear weapons. i think first it should be considered by the foreign relations committee or the armed services committee or the intelligence committee. for those reasons, i intend to vote against it. i am hopeful that when we get to 5:30, maybe conversations would continue, and the possibility could even exist that we could agree today to vote on the cotton amendment at 60 votes, dispose of it, vote on cloture to move ahead with the bill, and have final passage of the bill. if we can't do that, i see no reason we can't do it over the next couple of days. i thank the senator from california for the way she has worked with me on this issue. we have gotten almost to the finish line. she and i would like to set a good example for the other 11 appropriations bills that are coming up. there are other bills beyond that which we need to deal with, such as the 21st-century cures legislation on biomedical research, and there is the zika legislation that many senators are interested in. my hope is that we will find a way to resolve the only major issue that remains so we can pass a bill that virtually every senator in this body has some interest in and will probably vote for. i am optimistic and hopeful that we can move quickly on disposing of the cotton amendment so we can finish the bill. ideally we would do it today, but we can certainly get it done by tomorrow or wednesday. i yield the floor. ____________________",16872

CREC-2016-05-09-pt1-PgS2611-2,CREC-2016-05-09,114,"ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2611-S2615] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2028, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Pending: Alexander/Feinstein amendment No. 3801, in the nature of a substitute. Alexander amendment No. 3804 (to amendment No. 3801), to modify provisions relating to Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all time during quorum calls until 5:30 p.m. today be charged equally between both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wish to address the distinguished chairman of this subcommittee. Working with Senator Alexander on this bill has been a very good experience for me, and I think my friend knows that. We take great pride in getting things done. I very much appreciate his mentioning the standoff on the nuclear cruise missile legislation in some form of analogy, but I will say this: I have been in this body a long time, as has the Senator from Tennessee, and we both know that not everybody gets their vote. It just doesn't work that way. I can remember having an amendment on a bill year after year after year, and I never got a vote for it. That is not an unusual thing to happen. What has been unusual is to have one person take down a bill--particularly an appropriations bill. We were hoping we could demonstrate that we worked out our difficulties with this legislation. The Senator from Tennessee gave on some points, and I gave on some points. As my friend was good enough to mention, one of the points I gave on is something that I consider to be a very big issue which has not yet been settled, and that is a standoff nuclear cruise missile--and it has not yet been satisfactorily demonstrated to me that it is necessary--and that we do not have a satisfactory conventional weapon that can go through air defense systems. I believe we do. In any event, there is a strong constituency that feels as I do. Senator Alexander has been good enough to give me a hearing and some report language which contains some questions which the Defense Department will hopefully answer forthwith. I appreciate that, and that was enough for me. The standoff nuclear cruise missile is something we need to look more deeply into. The amendment that our side is so strongly opposed to, accompanied by the White House, is where one Senator is essentially hitting at the Iran nuclear agreement. The Iran nuclear agreement is not something that all of us don't know a lot about. A great deal of time was spent on it. There was a great deal of discussion both in subcommittees and on the floor, and there was a vote on it. So to a great extent, in my mind, it is very much a settled issue. The President has the right to go ahead with it, and I think that is very important. More importantly, Iran has kept the agreement and Iran has lived up to the terms of this nuclear-related agreement. If one thinks Iran doesn't know what is going on, one is wrong. Some of us went to meet with the Iranian Foreign Minister, and there was a question as to what is happening now, and of course there was concern. Having said that, the chairman gave me a hearing and some report language. I certainly would have no objection to giving the Senator from Arkansas a hearing, and yet I would not stand here and say that we should not protect the sanctity of that agreement, because I believe we should. I think the administration has done the right thing with the sale of this heavy water because we know if that heavy water is used in the United States of America, it will be used for peaceful purposes. A lot of it will go to a distinguished lab in the State of the Senator from Tennessee as well as other places. It can be sold to licensed businesses that do medical research and other kinds of manufacturing, such as carbon fiber, et cetera, where the nuclear component of heavy water is helpful. We know that if it goes on the open market, North Korea--if they were to be a buyer--would not use it for peaceful purposes; they would use it to help enrich plutonium for a bomb. So it makes imminent sense to me. The reason I oppose what is happening so strongly is because it is a strike at the Iran nuclear agreement, and it is seen that way by the administration. The administration has said they will veto the bill if this is in it. I don't want to lose the bill because of this--because of one Senator who wants to strike out with that agreement. I think that is the wrong thing to do. The Senator from Tennessee has been good enough to discuss this with me, and I really do appreciate that. We have discussed it in our caucus. There are very strong feelings about not moving to cloture until this issue is settled. I would certainly be happy to help settle it. From the conversation Senator Alexander and I had yesterday, it is my understanding that he is willing to oppose it. I trust that is still the case. I wish to ask a question to the chairman of our subcommittee through the Chair. Is it correct that the Senator from Tennessee would stand in opposition to this amendment? Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the answer to that question is yes, and [[Page S2612]] I wish to continue my answer to the question. While I defend Senator Cotton's right to have a vote, I see it a little differently than Senator Feinstein. Senator Feinstein supports the Iran agreement; I oppose it. In my opinion, this is not a vote about the Iran agreement; this is a question about what we should do with Iran's heavy water. I will oppose the Cotton amendment, No. 1, because if it were adopted, it would create the possibility that Iran's heavy water might be purchased not by the United States for peaceful purposes but will be purchased by countries like North Korea that might use it to make nuclear weapons; and No. 2, I think it would be more appropriate to have the Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, or the Intelligence Committee consider it. For those reasons, I intend to vote against the Cotton amendment. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator. I think that is a very wise response, and I think it is a correct response. I think it does belong in the Foreign Relations Committee. We have worked so hard to get a bill that could set a standard for this body so we could go back to regular order and begin to get appropriations bills passed in this house. Candidly, I don't want to lose that opportunity, and I think we still have it. Hope still reigns eternal, in my view, and I hope Senator Cotton will see that this is not worth taking down this bill, because I believe that would happen. I believe there are enough votes to deny cloture, and that is too bad. I don't want to see it because that means it is going to happen with other bills. It means that we are going to have what some term as poison pill amendments. The administration views this as a poison pill amendment. We know at Interior there are poison pill amendments. Both Senator Alexander and I have chaired that committee, and we know what happens. We are trying to set an example on this floor by working things out. It would seem to me that a reasonable Senator might say: All right. I am not going to hold up this bill. I made my point. I realize what is happening. I know this heavy water is going to be put to good use in this country. I know that Iran has to limit its supply at 130 metric tons, so we know this heavy water is out of Iran. As a matter of fact, it is in a storehouse in Oman. It is on the market, and the United States has said we would buy it. That is the right thing to do to set an example so that nuclear proliferation does not take place, and this is part of that. It is my hope that we will be able to resolve that. The Senator from Tennessee is imminently reasonable, and I like to believe that I am reasonable, I say to my colleague. I am hopeful that maybe before the hour of 5 p.m., we might be able to come to some agreement; otherwise, I think the cloture motion will be defeated. I yield the floor. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California. She and I will talk some more. I think we have stated the similarity in our positions, which is our opposition to the Cotton amendment, and the difference in our positions. She sees it as intricately related to the Iran nuclear agreement, which she passionately supports, and I see it as a separate issue because I oppose the Iran agreement. I don't think we will work that out in public here over the next hour and a half, so I suggest we continue our conversations between us, the majority, and the Democratic leader, and see where we get by 5:30 p.m. My hope is that we can dispose of the Cotton amendment, finish the bill, and get on with the other important business of the Senate sooner rather than later. I thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Remembering Bob Bennett Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I wish to make some remarks about our wonderful colleague who passed away last week, Senator Bob Bennett. Two of Senator Bennett's favorite Senators are here on the floor this afternoon--Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander. What Senator Bennett liked so much about Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein is what we have seen this afternoon. The two of them have a difference of opinion with respect, I gather, to the Iran deal. I happen to share Senator Feinstein's view, but the two of them are trying to find common ground here in the Senate. That is the Senate at its best, and that is exactly what Bob Bennett liked so much about both my colleague from California and my colleague from Tennessee. So I think it is very fitting that I open my remarks about Senator Bennett after having listened once again to the Chair and ranking member talk about how the Senate is supposed to do business. There are so many wonderful things to say about Bob Bennett, but I thought I would begin by talking about Senator Bennett's favorite subject because of something he created. He saw it is a great opportunity for the Senate, and he called it the grand bargain. Whenever I had a chance to sit down and talk with him--I had joined the Finance Committee--he would talk about the opportunities that were related to taxes. He often talked with Senator Alexander and me, as my colleague remembers. He talked to us about health care and taxes. He was very interested in innovation. By the way, I think he was one of the first Senators who purchased a hybrid vehicle close to 20 years ago, and he used that discussion to branch into the kinds of building connections that you have to do when you are talking about how you are going to increase the standard of living for Americans in a constantly changing world where you are really dealing with global economics. We don't just sell stuff to people down the street; we are competing against economic forces from all over the world. When Senator Bennett talked about his idea of a grand bargain--and you could be sitting with him in the Senate dining room, for example, and he probably took out a napkin if he couldn't find a piece of paper--what he was interested in was what I call principled bipartisanship. In other words, nobody gets everything they want, but what you try to do is find principles that you feel strongly about and principles that the other side feels strongly about--and that is what Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein were talking about this afternoon--and you find some common ground. It was very fortunate, as I look at my career in public service, that I had a chance to work with Bob Bennett. I will tell you, the way I see it, there was no better grand bargain in life than a friendship with Bob Bennett. We differed on plenty of stuff, just as I am sure Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander differ on matters. Bob would always say: Ron is pro-choice, I am pro-life; Ron was against the Iraq war, I was for the Iraq war. But we didn't spend our time arguing about those kinds of things. What we were interested in was finding ways to solve problems. I remember one example that I think my colleagues on the floor remember as well. Back at the time of Y2K, the turn of the century--oh, my goodness, one would have thought that western civilization was going to end. We were going to have this technology meltdown. It was going to be chaos around the world. Well, there were two bills at the time, two pieces of legislation. There was a bill from our former colleague, Senator Dodd, and Senator Bennett. I was a young upstart member of the Commerce Committee. Senator McCain, knowing my interest in technology policy, basically gave me a great honor by saying ``Why don't you be my running mate?'' because he was the chairman of the committee. So there were two bills; one was Senator McCain and I as the junior running mate, and the other was Bob Bennett and Chris Dodd. Everybody said there was going to be all kinds of fighting among the four of us. Nobody is going to agree. Nobody will pass a piece of legislation, and the country, as a result, will not be prepared. Well, because of Bob--I basically was the newcomer to the Senate. This was a big, important piece of legislation. Bob and Chris Dodd and Senator McCain basically said: We are not going to have any part of some bickerfest here in the U.S. Senate; we are going to solve a problem. And they did. You bet, it picked up opposition. There were some folks on the progressive side who had reservations about some provisions, and there were some folks on the conservative side who had reservations about the legislation. We [[Page S2613]] passed a bill. I remember going down to the Y2K center that night and staying up all night. I can't claim that our legislation was responsible for such a smooth-running transition, but we like to think that the fact that the Senate decided to set aside partisanship and actually get something done was constructive. The reality is that Bob Bennett firmly believed that he was elected to do more than just get reelected. I think that was right in the core of how he worked in the U.S. Senate. I have been in public life awhile. I was the director of the Gray Panthers for a number of years when I was a young man with a full head of hair and rugged good looks. I was always dreaming about being a major part of health reform, so I put together a bill. I said: I think my party is right that we are never going to get health care fixed unless we have universal coverage; otherwise, it will be cost shifting, and there won't be prevention. But the Republicans had a valid point, too, that there ought to be a role for the private sector. So I was talking to Republicans, and Senator Alexander remembers these visits. I went in to see Senator Bennett, whom I watched on the floor talking about health care, and he sounded like someone who might be interested, but I still thought it was a long shot. I said: My God, he is a really conservative fellow from Utah. He and a progressive fellow from Oregon probably don't have much in common, except for the fact that they are both tall. I talked to him in his office. He later said to a newspaper person: I gave the closest thing that you do in the Senate to convey that I really wasn't interested because you never say no, especially to somebody sincere. He said that a number of times. So he thought about it, and he spent time talking to people. I remember this as if it were yesterday because his seat was across the aisle, just a few seats away. He and Senator Rockefeller were the tallest Senators at the time; Senator Kerry and I kind of came in--I don't know--third or fourth or something like that. He came bounding over and he said: I want to do this with you. And I did a kind of double take because I thought, I don't think I am hearing this right. He said: Yes, you are talking about how the Democrats are right about universal coverage, and I am going to have to get my side kind of acclimated to that, but you acknowledge that there ought to be a role somehow, some way for the private sector. I said: You bet, that was the point. He said: I am in. So one of his newspapers--in looking at all the kind things that have been said--said that Bob Bennett did so much good work. We hope what his career stood for was that you could find common ground and that the Senate would remember going forward that bipartisanship is not a death sentence. Bipartisanship is a chance to find a way to solve problems, whether it was Y2K, which was exciting, or something else. I think it is worth mentioning, because I did a stint as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, that Bob Bennett put together a truly impressive public lands bill. It involved one of his fast-growing counties--Washington County--and several hundred thousand acres of wilderness, of land management, by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service alike. Suffice it to say that when I heard about it for the first time, Senator Bennett asked for my help, and I thought, man, there is no way he is going to be able to move something like this because you had all the progressive environmental organizations, you had lots of people from the counties who of course resisted these sorts of things, and you had lots of challenges in the West putting together public lands policies. We saw it again here recently in eastern Oregon. But Bob Bennett pulled it off. He pulled it off because he pretty much just smothered both sides with attention. Each side would have a point. He would respond. He would send his staff down to talk to people. And those who wouldn't normally possibly agree came together and found common ground on public lands policy. I remember because the President signed it in 2009, Senator Bennett and I were in the back--I guess largely because we were the tallest-- and we talked about how unlikely it was that we would be there and that we would have all of these opportunities to serve together. As we remember Bob Bennett, my hope is we will understand, as did Senator Bennett, that, much like today, neither side had enough votes to get everything it wanted. That was the case then, and it continues to be the case today. He understood that no single party had a lock on all the good ideas, but rather than just shrug his shoulders or go out and race for a microphone in order to score some sort of quick political advantage, Bob Bennett, in his career in the Senate, stood for what we call principled bipartisanship. I imagine there are going to be a number of farewells this week to a wonderful friend, a terrific Senator, in my view, and an even better person. I just hope that apropos of what we have seen with Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander, as they approach another big vote, let's put as much of our time and effort into finding common ground as possible. Sometimes it can't be done. I get that, and Bob Bennett did too. But certainly we can put vastly more time and effort into finding common ground, pursuing what Bob Bennett was all about because he was a U.S. Senator who gave public service a good name. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, if I may, I want to thank the Senator from Oregon for those remarks. My colleagues might be interested to know that I was chairman of Rules, and Bob was the ranking member, and this was during the period before the first inauguration of Barack Obama. As we all know, the Rules Committee is in charge of making the arrangements for the occasion. Bob was really just a wonderful person to work with. In the first place, we worked really well together. We sat down, we went over the problems, and we talked about solutions. Then came the subject of the Senate lunch following the inaugural. Well, I didn't pay much attention to it. Then I realized that this was a huge thing. It was in National Statuary Hall. There were decorations. We had to get a fine painting. In this case, I arranged for it to be a great California landscape by Thomas Hill, which came from the museum in New York. To plan for it, there is something that has been traditional, which is the meal tasting, and Senator Bennett and his wonderful wife Joyce and my husband and I went up to the fourth floor, and the table was set as it would be set at this lunch. We did a tasting from every culinary caterer who was bidding to do the lunch, believe it or not, and I think there were four of them. So there were four entrees and four salads and four desserts. And Joyce and Bob and Dick and I sat there, and we went through the motions and did it. But it was with great humor. And the two of them together really were a very special couple. The Senator from Oregon knew him in a different way than I knew him. Bob Bennett truly was a man among men. He had a humility about him, but he also had a real can-do sense, and he really cared about his Senate term. I know Senator Alexander knew him well. It was really wonderful for me on the Rules Committee because it was much the way the Senator from Tennessee is on Energy and Water appropriations. I had a chance to meet Joyce and get to know her, and it was very special. I think we put on a very good inaugural--a bipartisan inaugural, if you will--and I just want to say thank you, Senator. Mr. WYDEN. Thank you. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Because this really was a man who didn't participate in any obstruction or any difficulty. He was always positive and always willing to do his part and to help. That is really very special. I would like to give my best to his family and his friends. The State of Utah had a wonderful Senator in Bob Bennett, and he will be missed. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [[Page S2614]] Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so ordered. American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in support of legislation reforming the MTB, or the miscellaneous tariff benefit process. I am pleased to help this legislation advance. It is my hope that this bill will soon be on the President's desk. As many will remember, a dark cloud hung over the Congress with regard to the practice of earmarking in early 2009. The feeding at the earmark trough had long since expanded to the point of ridiculousness. Earmarks exploded to their annual record of $29 billion in 2006. They were long a problem before that, but it had become much, much worse at that time. Congress had become accustomed to powerful Members getting a large chunk of the earmark pie, and rank-and-file Members would fight over the scraps. We saw less and less true oversight as more and more spending was doled out in congressional back rooms. It wasn't just spending on earmarks that we didn't have good oversight on. It was the entire Federal budget. It was largely a problem because so much of our time in Congress was spent doling out earmarks and making sure that every Member got a few and that they were scattered around. We really gave up on the oversight that we should have been conducting. At the same time, earmarks opponents had ample opportunity to shame the process by highlighting bridges to nowhere, teapot museums, and the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame, for example, receiving these earmarks. But attention on the issue focused sharply in early February of 2009, when reports surfaced that a lobbying firm specializing in defense appropriations had been raided by the FBI. The New York Times noted that the firm ``set up shop at the busy intersection between political fund-raising and taxpayer spending, directing tens of millions of dollars in contributions to lawmakers, while steering hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks contracts back to his clients.'' The cloud over Congress darkened even further with suggestions of pay-to-play straw-man contributions, the reimbursing of employees for political contributions, and pressuring others for political giving. In quick succession, both the House and the Senate rightly put in place a moratorium over all earmarks, a ban that has remained intact ever since. While we gladly said goodbye to the bad old days of congressional porkbarrel spending, we soon found out that there were several things that Congress only knew how to do through earmarking. This included the so-called miscellaneous tariff benefits, or MTBs. MTBs are provisions that, when signed into law, provide tariff and duty relief for imports that are not domestically produced. The historic MTB process benefited from a consensus-driven process administered by the International Trade Commission that, for the most part, set it apart from the much ridiculed Federal largesse doled out by earmarking. Unfortunately, the original process also required that an original bill be introduced by a Member of Congress--a specific bill for a specific tariff reduction, often to benefit a particular for- profit company. I have long held that doing away with these individual bills and establishing an MTB process that relies on the ITC to accept and review proposals over which Congress has final say would be preferable. Such an approach would both comply with the earmark moratorium while providing taxpayers a measure of confidence that undue influence was not being inappropriately exerted. I am pleased to have the opportunity to work with both House and Senate leadership and with members of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Committee on Ways and Means on moving such a proposal forward. To be clear, my goals of being an original cosponsor of the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016 and vocally supporting moving forward with legislation reforming the MTB process is twofold. First and foremost, cutting tariffs is the right thing to do. In fact, I would support permanent tariff reductions as a means of furthering the benefits of free trade and lightening the burden on U.S. producers. In addition, the longer we go without being able to move forward with MTB bills, the more threatened the earmark moratorium is. I wish I could say that all Members of Congress are willing to permanently walk away from this wayward process of congressional earmarking, but that is not the case. Those wishing to go back to the bad old days will use any excuse to support ending the earmark moratorium. Reforming the MTB process not only provides a path for much needed tariff relief and a modicum of confidence for taxpayers, but it is also good for the long-term survival of the earmark moratorium. I am pleased to be a part of this effort moving forward. The House companion legislation passed with overwhelming support. I believe there were only two dissenting votes in the House. It is my hope that the Senate will soon follow suit. I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2028, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Pending: Alexander/Feinstein amendment No. 3801, in the nature of a substitute. Alexander amendment No. 3804 (to amendment No. 3801), to modify provisions relating to Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all time during quorum calls until 5:30 p.m. today be charged equally between both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wish to address the distinguished chairman of this subcommittee. Working with Senator Alexander on this bill has been a very good experience for me, and I think my friend knows that. We take great pride in getting things done. I very much appreciate his mentioning the standoff on the nuclear cruise missile legislation in some form of analogy, but I will say this: I have been in this body a long time, as has the Senator from Tennessee, and we both know that not everybody gets their vote. It just doesn't work that way. I can remember having an amendment on a bill year after year after year, and I never got a vote for it. That is not an unusual thing to happen. What has been unusual is to have one person take down a bill--particularly an appropriations bill. We were hoping we could demonstrate that we worked out our difficulties with this legislation. The Senator from Tennessee gave on some points, and I gave on some points. As my friend was good enough to mention, one of the points I gave on is something that I consider to be a very big issue which has not yet been settled, and that is a standoff nuclear cruise missile--and it has not yet been satisfactorily demonstrated to me that it is necessary--and that we do not have a satisfactory conventional weapon that can go through air defense systems. I believe we do. In any event, there is a strong constituency that feels as I do. Senator Alexander has been good enough to give me a hearing and some report language which contains some questions which the Defense Department will hopefully answer forthwith. I appreciate that, and that was enough for me. The standoff nuclear cruise missile is something we need to look more deeply into. The amendment that our side is so strongly opposed to, accompanied by the White House, is where one Senator is essentially hitting at the Iran nuclear agreement. The Iran nuclear agreement is not something that all of us don't know a lot about. A great deal of time was spent on it. There was a great deal of discussion both in subcommittees and on the floor, and there was a vote on it. So to a great extent, in my mind, it is very much a settled issue. The President has the right to go ahead with it, and I think that is very important. More importantly, Iran has kept the agreement and Iran has lived up to the terms of this nuclear-related agreement. If one thinks Iran doesn't know what is going on, one is wrong. Some of us went to meet with the Iranian Foreign Minister, and there was a question as to what is happening now, and of course there was concern. Having said that, the chairman gave me a hearing and some report language. I certainly would have no objection to giving the Senator from Arkansas a hearing, and yet I would not stand here and say that we should not protect the sanctity of that agreement, because I believe we should. I think the administration has done the right thing with the sale of this heavy water because we know if that heavy water is used in the United States of America, it will be used for peaceful purposes. A lot of it will go to a distinguished lab in the State of the Senator from Tennessee as well as other places. It can be sold to licensed businesses that do medical research and other kinds of manufacturing, such as carbon fiber, et cetera, where the nuclear component of heavy water is helpful. We know that if it goes on the open market, North Korea--if they were to be a buyer--would not use it for peaceful purposes; they would use it to help enrich plutonium for a bomb. So it makes imminent sense to me. The reason I oppose what is happening so strongly is because it is a strike at the Iran nuclear agreement, and it is seen that way by the administration. The administration has said they will veto the bill if this is in it. I don't want to lose the bill because of this--because of one Senator who wants to strike out with that agreement. I think that is the wrong thing to do. The Senator from Tennessee has been good enough to discuss this with me, and I really do appreciate that. We have discussed it in our caucus. There are very strong feelings about not moving to cloture until this issue is settled. I would certainly be happy to help settle it. From the conversation Senator Alexander and I had yesterday, it is my understanding that he is willing to oppose it. I trust that is still the case. I wish to ask a question to the chairman of our subcommittee through the Chair. Is it correct that the Senator from Tennessee would stand in opposition to this amendment? Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the answer to that question is yes, and [[Page S2612]] I wish to continue my answer to the question. While I defend Senator Cotton's right to have a vote, I see it a little differently than Senator Feinstein. Senator Feinstein supports the Iran agreement; I oppose it. In my opinion, this is not a vote about the Iran agreement; this is a question about what we should do with Iran's heavy water. I will oppose the Cotton amendment, No. 1, because if it were adopted, it would create the possibility that Iran's heavy water might be purchased not by the United States for peaceful purposes but will be purchased by countries like North Korea that might use it to make nuclear weapons; and No. 2, I think it would be more appropriate to have the Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, or the Intelligence Committee consider it. For those reasons, I intend to vote against the Cotton amendment. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator. I think that is a very wise response, and I think it is a correct response. I think it does belong in the Foreign Relations Committee. We have worked so hard to get a bill that could set a standard for this body so we could go back to regular order and begin to get appropriations bills passed in this house. Candidly, I don't want to lose that opportunity, and I think we still have it. Hope still reigns eternal, in my view, and I hope Senator Cotton will see that this is not worth taking down this bill, because I believe that would happen. I believe there are enough votes to deny cloture, and that is too bad. I don't want to see it because that means it is going to happen with other bills. It means that we are going to have what some term as poison pill amendments. The administration views this as a poison pill amendment. We know at Interior there are poison pill amendments. Both Senator Alexander and I have chaired that committee, and we know what happens. We are trying to set an example on this floor by working things out. It would seem to me that a reasonable Senator might say: All right. I am not going to hold up this bill. I made my point. I realize what is happening. I know this heavy water is going to be put to good use in this country. I know that Iran has to limit its supply at 130 metric tons, so we know this heavy water is out of Iran. As a matter of fact, it is in a storehouse in Oman. It is on the market, and the United States has said we would buy it. That is the right thing to do to set an example so that nuclear proliferation does not take place, and this is part of that. It is my hope that we will be able to resolve that. The Senator from Tennessee is imminently reasonable, and I like to believe that I am reasonable, I say to my colleague. I am hopeful that maybe before the hour of 5 p.m., we might be able to come to some agreement; otherwise, I think the cloture motion will be defeated. I yield the floor. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California. She and I will talk some more. I think we have stated the similarity in our positions, which is our opposition to the Cotton amendment, and the difference in our positions. She sees it as intricately related to the Iran nuclear agreement, which she passionately supports, and I see it as a separate issue because I oppose the Iran agreement. I don't think we will work that out in public here over the next hour and a half, so I suggest we continue our conversations between us, the majority, and the Democratic leader, and see where we get by 5:30 p.m. My hope is that we can dispose of the Cotton amendment, finish the bill, and get on with the other important business of the Senate sooner rather than later. I thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Remembering Bob Bennett Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I wish to make some remarks about our wonderful colleague who passed away last week, Senator Bob Bennett. Two of Senator Bennett's favorite Senators are here on the floor this afternoon--Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander. What Senator Bennett liked so much about Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein is what we have seen this afternoon. The two of them have a difference of opinion with respect, I gather, to the Iran deal. I happen to share Senator Feinstein's view, but the two of them are trying to find common ground here in the Senate. That is the Senate at its best, and that is exactly what Bob Bennett liked so much about both my colleague from California and my colleague from Tennessee. So I think it is very fitting that I open my remarks about Senator Bennett after having listened once again to the Chair and ranking member talk about how the Senate is supposed to do business. There are so many wonderful things to say about Bob Bennett, but I thought I would begin by talking about Senator Bennett's favorite subject because of something he created. He saw it is a great opportunity for the Senate, and he called it the grand bargain. Whenever I had a chance to sit down and talk with him--I had joined the Finance Committee--he would talk about the opportunities that were related to taxes. He often talked with Senator Alexander and me, as my colleague remembers. He talked to us about health care and taxes. He was very interested in innovation. By the way, I think he was one of the first Senators who purchased a hybrid vehicle close to 20 years ago, and he used that discussion to branch into the kinds of building connections that you have to do when you are talking about how you are going to increase the standard of living for Americans in a constantly changing world where you are really dealing with global economics. We don't just sell stuff to people down the street; we are competing against economic forces from all over the world. When Senator Bennett talked about his idea of a grand bargain--and you could be sitting with him in the Senate dining room, for example, and he probably took out a napkin if he couldn't find a piece of paper--what he was interested in was what I call principled bipartisanship. In other words, nobody gets everything they want, but what you try to do is find principles that you feel strongly about and principles that the other side feels strongly about--and that is what Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein were talking about this afternoon--and you find some common ground. It was very fortunate, as I look at my career in public service, that I had a chance to work with Bob Bennett. I will tell you, the way I see it, there was no better grand bargain in life than a friendship with Bob Bennett. We differed on plenty of stuff, just as I am sure Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander differ on matters. Bob would always say: Ron is pro-choice, I am pro-life; Ron was against the Iraq war, I was for the Iraq war. But we didn't spend our time arguing about those kinds of things. What we were interested in was finding ways to solve problems. I remember one example that I think my colleagues on the floor remember as well. Back at the time of Y2K, the turn of the century--oh, my goodness, one would have thought that western civilization was going to end. We were going to have this technology meltdown. It was going to be chaos around the world. Well, there were two bills at the time, two pieces of legislation. There was a bill from our former colleague, Senator Dodd, and Senator Bennett. I was a young upstart member of the Commerce Committee. Senator McCain, knowing my interest in technology policy, basically gave me a great honor by saying ``Why don't you be my running mate?'' because he was the chairman of the committee. So there were two bills; one was Senator McCain and I as the junior running mate, and the other was Bob Bennett and Chris Dodd. Everybody said there was going to be all kinds of fighting among the four of us. Nobody is going to agree. Nobody will pass a piece of legislation, and the country, as a result, will not be prepared. Well, because of Bob--I basically was the newcomer to the Senate. This was a big, important piece of legislation. Bob and Chris Dodd and Senator McCain basically said: We are not going to have any part of some bickerfest here in the U.S. Senate; we are going to solve a problem. And they did. You bet, it picked up opposition. There were some folks on the progressive side who had reservations about some provisions, and there were some folks on the conservative side who had reservations about the legislation. We [[Page S2613]] passed a bill. I remember going down to the Y2K center that night and staying up all night. I can't claim that our legislation was responsible for such a smooth-running transition, but we like to think that the fact that the Senate decided to set aside partisanship and actually get something done was constructive. The reality is that Bob Bennett firmly believed that he was elected to do more than just get reelected. I think that was right in the core of how he worked in the U.S. Senate. I have been in public life awhile. I was the director of the Gray Panthers for a number of years when I was a young man with a full head of hair and rugged good looks. I was always dreaming about being a major part of health reform, so I put together a bill. I said: I think my party is right that we are never going to get health care fixed unless we have universal coverage; otherwise, it will be cost shifting, and there won't be prevention. But the Republicans had a valid point, too, that there ought to be a role for the private sector. So I was talking to Republicans, and Senator Alexander remembers these visits. I went in to see Senator Bennett, whom I watched on the floor talking about health care, and he sounded like someone who might be interested, but I still thought it was a long shot. I said: My God, he is a really conservative fellow from Utah. He and a progressive fellow from Oregon probably don't have much in common, except for the fact that they are both tall. I talked to him in his office. He later said to a newspaper person: I gave the closest thing that you do in the Senate to convey that I really wasn't interested because you never say no, especially to somebody sincere. He said that a number of times. So he thought about it, and he spent time talking to people. I remember this as if it were yesterday because his seat was across the aisle, just a few seats away. He and Senator Rockefeller were the tallest Senators at the time; Senator Kerry and I kind of came in--I don't know--third or fourth or something like that. He came bounding over and he said: I want to do this with you. And I did a kind of double take because I thought, I don't think I am hearing this right. He said: Yes, you are talking about how the Democrats are right about universal coverage, and I am going to have to get my side kind of acclimated to that, but you acknowledge that there ought to be a role somehow, some way for the private sector. I said: You bet, that was the point. He said: I am in. So one of his newspapers--in looking at all the kind things that have been said--said that Bob Bennett did so much good work. We hope what his career stood for was that you could find common ground and that the Senate would remember going forward that bipartisanship is not a death sentence. Bipartisanship is a chance to find a way to solve problems, whether it was Y2K, which was exciting, or something else. I think it is worth mentioning, because I did a stint as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, that Bob Bennett put together a truly impressive public lands bill. It involved one of his fast-growing counties--Washington County--and several hundred thousand acres of wilderness, of land management, by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service alike. Suffice it to say that when I heard about it for the first time, Senator Bennett asked for my help, and I thought, man, there is no way he is going to be able to move something like this because you had all the progressive environmental organizations, you had lots of people from the counties who of course resisted these sorts of things, and you had lots of challenges in the West putting together public lands policies. We saw it again here recently in eastern Oregon. But Bob Bennett pulled it off. He pulled it off because he pretty much just smothered both sides with attention. Each side would have a point. He would respond. He would send his staff down to talk to people. And those who wouldn't normally possibly agree came together and found common ground on public lands policy. I remember because the President signed it in 2009, Senator Bennett and I were in the back--I guess largely because we were the tallest-- and we talked about how unlikely it was that we would be there and that we would have all of these opportunities to serve together. As we remember Bob Bennett, my hope is we will understand, as did Senator Bennett, that, much like today, neither side had enough votes to get everything it wanted. That was the case then, and it continues to be the case today. He understood that no single party had a lock on all the good ideas, but rather than just shrug his shoulders or go out and race for a microphone in order to score some sort of quick political advantage, Bob Bennett, in his career in the Senate, stood for what we call principled bipartisanship. I imagine there are going to be a number of farewells this week to a wonderful friend, a terrific Senator, in my view, and an even better person. I just hope that apropos of what we have seen with Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander, as they approach another big vote, let's put as much of our time and effort into finding common ground as possible. Sometimes it can't be done. I get that, and Bob Bennett did too. But certainly we can put vastly more time and effort into finding common ground, pursuing what Bob Bennett was all about because he was a U.S. Senator who gave public service a good name. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, if I may, I want to thank the Senator from Oregon for those remarks. My colleagues might be interested to know that I was chairman of Rules, and Bob was the ranking member, and this was during the period before the first inauguration of Barack Obama. As we all know, the Rules Committee is in charge of making the arrangements for the occasion. Bob was really just a wonderful person to work with. In the first place, we worked really well together. We sat down, we went over the problems, and we talked about solutions. Then came the subject of the Senate lunch following the inaugural. Well, I didn't pay much attention to it. Then I realized that this was a huge thing. It was in National Statuary Hall. There were decorations. We had to get a fine painting. In this case, I arranged for it to be a great California landscape by Thomas Hill, which came from the museum in New York. To plan for it, there is something that has been traditional, which is the meal tasting, and Senator Bennett and his wonderful wife Joyce and my husband and I went up to the fourth floor, and the table was set as it would be set at this lunch. We did a tasting from every culinary caterer who was bidding to do the lunch, believe it or not, and I think there were four of them. So there were four entrees and four salads and four desserts. And Joyce and Bob and Dick and I sat there, and we went through the motions and did it. But it was with great humor. And the two of them together really were a very special couple. The Senator from Oregon knew him in a different way than I knew him. Bob Bennett truly was a man among men. He had a humility about him, but he also had a real can-do sense, and he really cared about his Senate term. I know Senator Alexander knew him well. It was really wonderful for me on the Rules Committee because it was much the way the Senator from Tennessee is on Energy and Water appropriations. I had a chance to meet Joyce and get to know her, and it was very special. I think we put on a very good inaugural--a bipartisan inaugural, if you will--and I just want to say thank you, Senator. Mr. WYDEN. Thank you. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Because this really was a man who didn't participate in any obstruction or any difficulty. He was always positive and always willing to do his part and to help. That is really very special. I would like to give my best to his family and his friends. The State of Utah had a wonderful Senator in Bob Bennett, and he will be missed. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [[Page S2614]] Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so ordered. American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in support of legislation reforming the MTB, or the miscellaneous tariff benefit process. I am pleased to help this legislation advance. It is my hope that this bill will soon be on the President's desk. As many will remember, a dark cloud hung over the Congress with regard to the practice of earmarking in early 2009. The feeding at the earmark trough had long since expanded to the point of ridiculousness. Earmarks exploded to their annual record of $29 billion in 2006. They were long a problem before that, but it had become much, much worse at that time. Congress had become accustomed to powerful Members getting a large chunk of the earmark pie, and rank-and-file Members would fight over the scraps. We saw less and less true oversight as more and more spending was doled out in congressional back rooms. It wasn't just spending on earmarks that we didn't have good oversight on. It was the entire Federal budget. It was largely a problem because so much of our time in Congress was spent doling out earmarks and making sure that every Member got a few and that they were scattered around. We really gave up on the oversight that we should have been conducting. At the same time, earmarks opponents had ample opportunity to shame the process by highlighting bridges to nowhere, teapot museums, and the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame, for example, receiving these earmarks. But attention on the issue focused sharply in early February of 2009, when reports surfaced that a lobbying firm specializing in defense appropriations had been raided by the FBI. The New York Times noted that the firm ``set up shop at the busy intersection between political fund-raising and taxpayer spending, directing tens of millions of dollars in contributions to lawmakers, while steering hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks contracts back to his clients.'' The cloud over Congress darkened even further with suggestions of pay-to-play straw-man contributions, the reimbursing of employees for political contributions, and pressuring others for political giving. In quick succession, both the House and the Senate rightly put in place a moratorium over all earmarks, a ban that has remained intact ever since. While we gladly said goodbye to the bad old days of congressional porkbarrel spending, we soon found out that there were several things that Congress only knew how to do through earmarking. This included the so-called miscellaneous tariff benefits, or MTBs. MTBs are provisions that, when signed into law, provide tariff and duty relief for imports that are not domestically produced. The historic MTB process benefited from a consensus-driven process administered by the International Trade Commission that, for the most part, set it apart from the much ridiculed Federal largesse doled out by earmarking. Unfortunately, the original process also required that an original bill be introduced by a Member of Congress--a specific bill for a specific tariff reduction, often to benefit a particular for- profit company. I have long held that doing away with these individual bills and establishing an MTB process that relies on the ITC to accept and review proposals over which Congress has final say would be preferable. Such an approach would both comply with the earmark moratorium while providing taxpayers a measure of confidence that undue influence was not being inappropriately exerted. I am pleased to have the opportunity to work with both House and Senate leadership and with members of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Committee on Ways and Means on moving such a proposal forward. To be clear, my goals of being an original cosponsor of the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016 and vocally supporting moving forward with legislation reforming the MTB process is twofold. First and foremost, cutting tariffs is the right thing to do. In fact, I would support permanent tariff reductions as a means of furthering the benefits of free trade and lightening the burden on U.S. producers. In addition, the longer we go without being able to move forward with MTB bills, the more threatened the earmark moratorium is. I wish I could say that all Members of Congress are willing to permanently walk away from this wayward process of congressional earmarking, but that is not the case. Those wishing to go back to the bad old days will use any excuse to support ending the earmark moratorium. Reforming the MTB process not only provides a path for much needed tariff relief and a modicum of confidence for taxpayers, but it is also good for the long-term survival of the earmark moratorium. I am pleased to be a part of this effort moving forward. The House companion legislation passed with overwhelming support. I believe there were only two dissenting votes in the House. It is my hope that the Senate will soon follow suit. I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2028, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Pending: Alexander/Feinstein amendment No. 3801, in the nature of a substitute. Alexander amendment No. 3804 (to amendment No. 3801), to modify provisions relating to Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all time during quorum calls until 5:30 p.m. today be charged equally between both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wish to address the distinguished chairman of this subcommittee. Working with Senator Alexander on this bill has been a very good experience for me, and I think my friend knows that. We take great pride in getting things done. I very much appreciate his mentioning the standoff on the nuclear cruise missile legislation in some form of analogy, but I will say this: I have been in this body a long time, as has the Senator from Tennessee, and we both know that not everybody gets their vote. It just doesn't work that way. I can remember having an amendment on a bill year after year after year, and I never got a vote for it. That is not an unusual thing to happen. What has been unusual is to have one person take down a bill--particularly an appropriations bill. We were hoping we could demonstrate that we worked out our difficulties with this legislation. The Senator from Tennessee gave on some points, and I gave on some points. As my friend was good enough to mention, one of the points I gave on is something that I consider to be a very big issue which has not yet been settled, and that is a standoff nuclear cruise missile--and it has not yet been satisfactorily demonstrated to me that it is necessary--and that we do not have a satisfactory conventional weapon that can go through air defense systems. I believe we do. In any event, there is a strong constituency that feels as I do. Senator Alexander has been good enough to give me a hearing and some report language which contains some questions which the Defense Department will hopefully answer forthwith. I appreciate that, and that was enough for me. The standoff nuclear cruise missile is something we need to look more deeply into. The amendment that our side is so strongly opposed to, accompanied by the White House, is where one Senator is essentially hitting at the Iran nuclear agreement. The Iran nuclear agreement is not something that all of us don't know a lot about. A great deal of time was spent on it. There was a great deal of discussion both in subcommittees and on the floor, and there was a vote on it. So to a great extent, in my mind, it is very much a settled issue. The President has the right to go ahead with it, and I think that is very important. More importantly, Iran has kept the agreement and Iran has lived up to the terms of this nuclear-related agreement. If one thinks Iran doesn't know what is going on, one is wrong. Some of us went to meet with the Iranian Foreign Minister, and there was a question as to what is happening now, and of course there was concern. Having said that, the chairman gave me a hearing and some report language. I certainly would have no objection to giving the Senator from Arkansas a hearing, and yet I would not stand here and say that we should not protect the sanctity of that agreement, because I believe we should. I think the administration has done the right thing with the sale of this heavy water because we know if that heavy water is used in the United States of America, it will be used for peaceful purposes. A lot of it will go to a distinguished lab in the State of the Senator from Tennessee as well as other places. It can be sold to licensed businesses that do medical research and other kinds of manufacturing, such as carbon fiber, et cetera, where the nuclear component of heavy water is helpful. We know that if it goes on the open market, North Korea--if they were to be a buyer--would not use it for peaceful purposes; they would use it to help enrich plutonium for a bomb. So it makes imminent sense to me. The reason I oppose what is happening so strongly is because it is a strike at the Iran nuclear agreement, and it is seen that way by the administration. The administration has said they will veto the bill if this is in it. I don't want to lose the bill because of this--because of one Senator who wants to strike out with that agreement. I think that is the wrong thing to do. The Senator from Tennessee has been good enough to discuss this with me, and I really do appreciate that. We have discussed it in our caucus. There are very strong feelings about not moving to cloture until this issue is settled. I would certainly be happy to help settle it. From the conversation Senator Alexander and I had yesterday, it is my understanding that he is willing to oppose it. I trust that is still the case. I wish to ask a question to the chairman of our subcommittee through the Chair. Is it correct that the Senator from Tennessee would stand in opposition to this amendment? Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the answer to that question is yes, and [[Page S2612]] I wish to continue my answer to the question. While I defend Senator Cotton's right to have a vote, I see it a little differently than Senator Feinstein. Senator Feinstein supports the Iran agreement; I oppose it. In my opinion, this is not a vote about the Iran agreement; this is a question about what we should do with Iran's heavy water. I will oppose the Cotton amendment, No. 1, because if it were adopted, it would create the possibility that Iran's heavy water might be purchased not by the United States for peaceful purposes but will be purchased by countries like North Korea that might use it to make nuclear weapons; and No. 2, I think it would be more appropriate to have the Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, or the Intelligence Committee consider it. For those reasons, I intend to vote against the Cotton amendment. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator. I think that is a very wise response, and I think it is a correct response. I think it does belong in the Foreign Relations Committee. We have worked so hard to get a bill that could set a standard for this body so we could go back to regular order and begin to get appropriations bills passed in this house. Candidly, I don't want to lose that opportunity, and I think we still have it. Hope still reigns eternal, in my view, and I hope Senator Cotton will see that this is not worth taking down this bill, because I believe that would happen. I believe there are enough votes to deny cloture, and that is too bad. I don't want to see it because that means it is going to happen with other bills. It means that we are going to have what some term as poison pill amendments. The administration views this as a poison pill amendment. We know at Interior there are poison pill amendments. Both Senator Alexander and I have chaired that committee, and we know what happens. We are trying to set an example on this floor by working things out. It would seem to me that a reasonable Senator might say: All right. I am not going to hold up this bill. I made my point. I realize what is happening. I know this heavy water is going to be put to good use in this country. I know that Iran has to limit its supply at 130 metric tons, so we know this heavy water is out of Iran. As a matter of fact, it is in a storehouse in Oman. It is on the market, and the United States has said we would buy it. That is the right thing to do to set an example so that nuclear proliferation does not take place, and this is part of that. It is my hope that we will be able to resolve that. The Senator from Tennessee is imminently reasonable, and I like to believe that I am reasonable, I say to my colleague. I am hopeful that maybe before the hour of 5 p.m., we might be able to come to some agreement; otherwise, I think the cloture motion will be defeated. I yield the floor. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California. She and I will talk some more. I think we have stated the similarity in our positions, which is our opposition to the Cotton amendment, and the difference in our positions. She sees it as intricately related to the Iran nuclear agreement, which she passionately supports, and I see it as a separate issue because I oppose the Iran agreement. I don't think we will work that out in public here over the next hour and a half, so I suggest we continue our conversations between us, the majority, and the Democratic leader, and see where we get by 5:30 p.m. My hope is that we can dispose of the Cotton amendment, finish the bill, and get on with the other important business of the Senate sooner rather than later. I thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Remembering Bob Bennett Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I wish to make some remarks about our wonderful colleague who passed away last week, Senator Bob Bennett. Two of Senator Bennett's favorite Senators are here on the floor this afternoon--Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander. What Senator Bennett liked so much about Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein is what we have seen this afternoon. The two of them have a difference of opinion with respect, I gather, to the Iran deal. I happen to share Senator Feinstein's view, but the two of them are trying to find common ground here in the Senate. That is the Senate at its best, and that is exactly what Bob Bennett liked so much about both my colleague from California and my colleague from Tennessee. So I think it is very fitting that I open my remarks about Senator Bennett after having listened once again to the Chair and ranking member talk about how the Senate is supposed to do business. There are so many wonderful things to say about Bob Bennett, but I thought I would begin by talking about Senator Bennett's favorite subject because of something he created. He saw it is a great opportunity for the Senate, and he called it the grand bargain. Whenever I had a chance to sit down and talk with him--I had joined the Finance Committee--he would talk about the opportunities that were related to taxes. He often talked with Senator Alexander and me, as my colleague remembers. He talked to us about health care and taxes. He was very interested in innovation. By the way, I think he was one of the first Senators who purchased a hybrid vehicle close to 20 years ago, and he used that discussion to branch into the kinds of building connections that you have to do when you are talking about how you are going to increase the standard of living for Americans in a constantly changing world where you are really dealing with global economics. We don't just sell stuff to people down the street; we are competing against economic forces from all over the world. When Senator Bennett talked about his idea of a grand bargain--and you could be sitting with him in the Senate dining room, for example, and he probably took out a napkin if he couldn't find a piece of paper--what he was interested in was what I call principled bipartisanship. In other words, nobody gets everything they want, but what you try to do is find principles that you feel strongly about and principles that the other side feels strongly about--and that is what Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein were talking about this afternoon--and you find some common ground. It was very fortunate, as I look at my career in public service, that I had a chance to work with Bob Bennett. I will tell you, the way I see it, there was no better grand bargain in life than a friendship with Bob Bennett. We differed on plenty of stuff, just as I am sure Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander differ on matters. Bob would always say: Ron is pro-choice, I am pro-life; Ron was against the Iraq war, I was for the Iraq war. But we didn't spend our time arguing about those kinds of things. What we were interested in was finding ways to solve problems. I remember one example that I think my colleagues on the floor remember as well. Back at the time of Y2K, the turn of the century--oh, my goodness, one would have thought that western civilization was going to end. We were going to have this technology meltdown. It was going to be chaos around the world. Well, there were two bills at the time, two pieces of legislation. There was a bill from our former colleague, Senator Dodd, and Senator Bennett. I was a young upstart member of the Commerce Committee. Senator McCain, knowing my interest in technology policy, basically gave me a great honor by saying ``Why don't you be my running mate?'' because he was the chairman of the committee. So there were two bills; one was Senator McCain and I as the junior running mate, and the other was Bob Bennett and Chris Dodd. Everybody said there was going to be all kinds of fighting among the four of us. Nobody is going to agree. Nobody will pass a piece of legislation, and the country, as a result, will not be prepared. Well, because of Bob--I basically was the newcomer to the Senate. This was a big, important piece of legislation. Bob and Chris Dodd and Senator McCain basically said: We are not going to have any part of some bickerfest here in the U.S. Senate; we are going to solve a problem. And they did. You bet, it picked up opposition. There were some folks on the progressive side who had reservations about some provisions, and there were some folks on the conservative side who had reservations about the legislation. We [[Page S2613]] passed a bill. I remember going down to the Y2K center that night and staying up all night. I can't claim that our legislation was responsible for such a smooth-running transition, but we like to think that the fact that the Senate decided to set aside partisanship and actually get something done was constructive. The reality is that Bob Bennett firmly believed that he was elected to do more than just get reelected. I think that was right in the core of how he worked in the U.S. Senate. I have been in public life awhile. I was the director of the Gray Panthers for a number of years when I was a young man with a full head of hair and rugged good looks. I was always dreaming about being a major part of health reform, so I put together a bill. I said: I think my party is right that we are never going to get health care fixed unless we have universal coverage; otherwise, it will be cost shifting, and there won't be prevention. But the Republicans had a valid point, too, that there ought to be a role for the private sector. So I was talking to Republicans, and Senator Alexander remembers these visits. I went in to see Senator Bennett, whom I watched on the floor talking about health care, and he sounded like someone who might be interested, but I still thought it was a long shot. I said: My God, he is a really conservative fellow from Utah. He and a progressive fellow from Oregon probably don't have much in common, except for the fact that they are both tall. I talked to him in his office. He later said to a newspaper person: I gave the closest thing that you do in the Senate to convey that I really wasn't interested because you never say no, especially to somebody sincere. He said that a number of times. So he thought about it, and he spent time talking to people. I remember this as if it were yesterday because his seat was across the aisle, just a few seats away. He and Senator Rockefeller were the tallest Senators at the time; Senator Kerry and I kind of came in--I don't know--third or fourth or something like that. He came bounding over and he said: I want to do this with you. And I did a kind of double take because I thought, I don't think I am hearing this right. He said: Yes, you are talking about how the Democrats are right about universal coverage, and I am going to have to get my side kind of acclimated to that, but you acknowledge that there ought to be a role somehow, some way for the private sector. I said: You bet, that was the point. He said: I am in. So one of his newspapers--in looking at all the kind things that have been said--said that Bob Bennett did so much good work. We hope what his career stood for was that you could find common ground and that the Senate would remember going forward that bipartisanship is not a death sentence. Bipartisanship is a chance to find a way to solve problems, whether it was Y2K, which was exciting, or something else. I think it is worth mentioning, because I did a stint as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, that Bob Bennett put together a truly impressive public lands bill. It involved one of his fast-growing counties--Washington County--and several hundred thousand acres of wilderness, of land management, by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service alike. Suffice it to say that when I heard about it for the first time, Senator Bennett asked for my help, and I thought, man, there is no way he is going to be able to move something like this because you had all the progressive environmental organizations, you had lots of people from the counties who of course resisted these sorts of things, and you had lots of challenges in the West putting together public lands policies. We saw it again here recently in eastern Oregon. But Bob Bennett pulled it off. He pulled it off because he pretty much just smothered both sides with attention. Each side would have a point. He would respond. He would send his staff down to talk to people. And those who wouldn't normally possibly agree came together and found common ground on public lands policy. I remember because the President signed it in 2009, Senator Bennett and I were in the back--I guess largely because we were the tallest-- and we talked about how unlikely it was that we would be there and that we would have all of these opportunities to serve together. As we remember Bob Bennett, my hope is we will understand, as did Senator Bennett, that, much like today, neither side had enough votes to get everything it wanted. That was the case then, and it continues to be the case today. He understood that no single party had a lock on all the good ideas, but rather than just shrug his shoulders or go out and race for a microphone in order to score some sort of quick political advantage, Bob Bennett, in his career in the Senate, stood for what we call principled bipartisanship. I imagine there are going to be a number of farewells this week to a wonderful friend, a terrific Senator, in my view, and an even better person. I just hope that apropos of what we have seen with Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander, as they approach another big vote, let's put as much of our time and effort into finding common ground as possible. Sometimes it can't be done. I get that, and Bob Bennett did too. But certainly we can put vastly more time and effort into finding common ground, pursuing what Bob Bennett was all about because he was a U.S. Senator who gave public service a good name. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, if I may, I want to thank the Senator from Oregon for those remarks. My colleagues might be interested to know that I was chairman of Rules, and Bob was the ranking member, and this was during the period before the first inauguration of Barack Obama. As we all know, the Rules Committee is in charge of making the arrangements for the occasion. Bob was really just a wonderful person to work with. In the first place, we worked really well together. We sat down, we went over the problems, and we talked about solutions. Then came the subject of the Senate lunch following the inaugural. Well, I didn't pay much attention to it. Then I realized that this was a huge thing. It was in National Statuary Hall. There were decorations. We had to get a fine painting. In this case, I arranged for it to be a great California landscape by Thomas Hill, which came from the museum in New York. To plan for it, there is something that has been traditional, which is the meal tasting, and Senator Bennett and his wonderful wife Joyce and my husband and I went up to the fourth floor, and the table was set as it would be set at this lunch. We did a tasting from every culinary caterer who was bidding to do the lunch, believe it or not, and I think there were four of them. So there were four entrees and four salads and four desserts. And Joyce and Bob and Dick and I sat there, and we went through the motions and did it. But it was with great humor. And the two of them together really were a very special couple. The Senator from Oregon knew him in a different way than I knew him. Bob Bennett truly was a man among men. He had a humility about him, but he also had a real can-do sense, and he really cared about his Senate term. I know Senator Alexander knew him well. It was really wonderful for me on the Rules Committee because it was much the way the Senator from Tennessee is on Energy and Water appropriations. I had a chance to meet Joyce and get to know her, and it was very special. I think we put on a very good inaugural--a bipartisan inaugural, if you will--and I just want to say thank you, Senator. Mr. WYDEN. Thank you. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Because this really was a man who didn't participate in any obstruction or any difficulty. He was always positive and always willing to do his part and to help. That is really very special. I would like to give my best to his family and his friends. The State of Utah had a wonderful Senator in Bob Bennett, and he will be missed. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [[Page S2614]] Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so ordered. American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in support of legislation reforming the MTB, or the miscellaneous tariff benefit process. I am pleased to help this legislation advance. It is my hope that this bill will soon be on the President's desk. As many will remember, a dark cloud hung over the Congress with regard to the practice of earmarking in early 2009. The feeding at the earmark trough had long since expanded to the point of ridiculousness. Earmarks exploded to their annual record of $29 billion in 2006. They were long a problem before that, but it had become much, much worse at that time. Congress had become accustomed to powerful Members getting a large chunk of the earmark pie, and rank-and-file Members would fight over the scraps. We saw less and less true oversight as more and more spending was doled out in congressional back rooms. It wasn't just spending on earmarks that we didn't have good oversight on. It was the entire Federal budget. It was largely a problem because so much of our time in Congress was spent doling out earmarks and making sure that every Member got a few and that they were scattered around. We really gave up on the oversight that we should have been conducting. At the same time, earmarks opponents had ample opportunity to shame the process by highlighting bridges to nowhere, teapot museums, and the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame, for example, receiving these earmarks. But attention on the issue focused sharply in early February of 2009, when reports surfaced that a lobbying firm specializing in defense appropriations had been raided by the FBI. The New York Times noted that the firm ``set up shop at the busy intersection between political fund-raising and taxpayer spending, directing tens of millions of dollars in contributions to lawmakers, while steering hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks contracts back to his clients.'' The cloud over Congress darkened even further with suggestions of pay-to-play straw-man contributions, the reimbursing of employees for political contributions, and pressuring others for political giving. In quick succession, both the House and the Senate rightly put in place a moratorium over all earmarks, a ban that has remained intact ever since. While we gladly said goodbye to the bad old days of congressional porkbarrel spending, we soon found out that there were several things that Congress only knew how to do through earmarking. This included the so-called miscellaneous tariff benefits, or MTBs. MTBs are provisions that, when signed into law, provide tariff and duty relief for imports that are not domestically produced. The historic MTB process benefited from a consensus-driven process administered by the International Trade Commission that, for the most part, set it apart from the much ridiculed Federal largesse doled out by earmarking. Unfortunately, the original process also required that an original bill be introduced by a Member of Congress--a specific bill for a specific tariff reduction, often to benefit a particular for- profit company. I have long held that doing away with these individual bills and establishing an MTB process that relies on the ITC to accept and review proposals over which Congress has final say would be preferable. Such an approach would both comply with the earmark moratorium while providing taxpayers a measure of confidence that undue influence was not being inappropriately exerted. I am pleased to have the opportunity to work with both House and Senate leadership and with members of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Committee on Ways and Means on moving such a proposal forward. To be clear, my goals of being an original cosponsor of the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016 and vocally supporting moving forward with legislation reforming the MTB process is twofold. First and foremost, cutting tariffs is the right thing to do. In fact, I would support permanent tariff reductions as a means of furthering the benefits of free trade and lightening the burden on U.S. producers. In addition, the longer we go without being able to move forward with MTB bills, the more threatened the earmark moratorium is. I wish I could say that all Members of Congress are willing to permanently walk away from this wayward process of congressional earmarking, but that is not the case. Those wishing to go back to the bad old days will use any excuse to support ending the earmark moratorium. Reforming the MTB process not only provides a path for much needed tariff relief and a modicum of confidence for taxpayers, but it is also good for the long-term survival of the earmark moratorium. I am pleased to be a part of this effort moving forward. The House companion legislation passed with overwhelming support. I believe there were only two dissenting votes in the House. It is my hope that the Senate will soon follow suit. I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] energy and water development and related agencies appropriations act, 2016 the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of h.r. 2028, which the clerk will report. the bill clerk read as follows: a bill (h.r. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30, 2016, and for other purposes. pending: alexander/feinstein amendment no. 3801, in the nature of a substitute. alexander amendment no. 3804 (to amendment no. 3801), to modify provisions relating to nuclear regulatory commission fees. the presiding officer. the senator from tennessee. mr. alexander. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that all time during quorum calls until 5:30 p.m. today be charged equally between both sides. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from california. mrs. feinstein. madam president, i wish to address the distinguished chairman of this subcommittee. working with senator alexander on this bill has been a very good experience for me, and i think my friend knows that. we take great pride in getting things done. i very much appreciate his mentioning the standoff on the nuclear cruise missile legislation in some form of analogy, but i will say this: i have been in this body a long time, as has the senator from tennessee, and we both know that not everybody gets their vote. it just doesn't work that way. i can remember having an amendment on a bill year after year after year, and i never got a vote for it. that is not an unusual thing to happen. what has been unusual is to have one person take down a bill--particularly an appropriations bill. we were hoping we could demonstrate that we worked out our difficulties with this legislation. the senator from tennessee gave on some points, and i gave on some points. as my friend was good enough to mention, one of the points i gave on is something that i consider to be a very big issue which has not yet been settled, and that is a standoff nuclear cruise missile--and it has not yet been satisfactorily demonstrated to me that it is necessary--and that we do not have a satisfactory conventional weapon that can go through air defense systems. i believe we do. in any event, there is a strong constituency that feels as i do. senator alexander has been good enough to give me a hearing and some report language which contains some questions which the defense department will hopefully answer forthwith. i appreciate that, and that was enough for me. the standoff nuclear cruise missile is something we need to look more deeply into. the amendment that our side is so strongly opposed to, accompanied by the white house, is where one senator is essentially hitting at the iran nuclear agreement. the iran nuclear agreement is not something that all of us don't know a lot about. a great deal of time was spent on it. there was a great deal of discussion both in subcommittees and on the floor, and there was a vote on it. so to a great extent, in my mind, it is very much a settled issue. the president has the right to go ahead with it, and i think that is very important. more importantly, iran has kept the agreement and iran has lived up to the terms of this nuclear-related agreement. if one thinks iran doesn't know what is going on, one is wrong. some of us went to meet with the iranian foreign minister, and there was a question as to what is happening now, and of course there was concern. having said that, the chairman gave me a hearing and some report language. i certainly would have no objection to giving the senator from arkansas a hearing, and yet i would not stand here and say that we should not protect the sanctity of that agreement, because i believe we should. i think the administration has done the right thing with the sale of this heavy water because we know if that heavy water is used in the united states of america, it will be used for peaceful purposes. a lot of it will go to a distinguished lab in the state of the senator from tennessee as well as other places. it can be sold to licensed businesses that do medical research and other kinds of manufacturing, such as carbon fiber, et cetera, where the nuclear component of heavy water is helpful. we know that if it goes on the open market, north korea--if they were to be a buyer--would not use it for peaceful purposes; they would use it to help enrich plutonium for a bomb. so it makes imminent sense to me. the reason i oppose what is happening so strongly is because it is a strike at the iran nuclear agreement, and it is seen that way by the administration. the administration has said they will veto the bill if this is in it. i don't want to lose the bill because of this--because of one senator who wants to strike out with that agreement. i think that is the wrong thing to do. the senator from tennessee has been good enough to discuss this with me, and i really do appreciate that. we have discussed it in our caucus. there are very strong feelings about not moving to cloture until this issue is settled. i would certainly be happy to help settle it. from the conversation senator alexander and i had yesterday, it is my understanding that he is willing to oppose it. i trust that is still the case. i wish to ask a question to the chairman of our subcommittee through the chair. is it correct that the senator from tennessee would stand in opposition to this amendment? mr. alexander. madam president, the answer to that question is yes, and [[page s2612]] i wish to continue my answer to the question. while i defend senator cotton's right to have a vote, i see it a little differently than senator feinstein. senator feinstein supports the iran agreement; i oppose it. in my opinion, this is not a vote about the iran agreement; this is a question about what we should do with iran's heavy water. i will oppose the cotton amendment, no. 1, because if it were adopted, it would create the possibility that iran's heavy water might be purchased not by the united states for peaceful purposes but will be purchased by countries like north korea that might use it to make nuclear weapons; and no. 2, i think it would be more appropriate to have the foreign relations committee, the armed services committee, or the intelligence committee consider it. for those reasons, i intend to vote against the cotton amendment. mrs. feinstein. madam president, i thank the chair and i thank the senator. i think that is a very wise response, and i think it is a correct response. i think it does belong in the foreign relations committee. we have worked so hard to get a bill that could set a standard for this body so we could go back to regular order and begin to get appropriations bills passed in this house. candidly, i don't want to lose that opportunity, and i think we still have it. hope still reigns eternal, in my view, and i hope senator cotton will see that this is not worth taking down this bill, because i believe that would happen. i believe there are enough votes to deny cloture, and that is too bad. i don't want to see it because that means it is going to happen with other bills. it means that we are going to have what some term as poison pill amendments. the administration views this as a poison pill amendment. we know at interior there are poison pill amendments. both senator alexander and i have chaired that committee, and we know what happens. we are trying to set an example on this floor by working things out. it would seem to me that a reasonable senator might say: all right. i am not going to hold up this bill. i made my point. i realize what is happening. i know this heavy water is going to be put to good use in this country. i know that iran has to limit its supply at 130 metric tons, so we know this heavy water is out of iran. as a matter of fact, it is in a storehouse in oman. it is on the market, and the united states has said we would buy it. that is the right thing to do to set an example so that nuclear proliferation does not take place, and this is part of that. it is my hope that we will be able to resolve that. the senator from tennessee is imminently reasonable, and i like to believe that i am reasonable, i say to my colleague. i am hopeful that maybe before the hour of 5 p.m., we might be able to come to some agreement; otherwise, i think the cloture motion will be defeated. i yield the floor. mr. alexander. madam president, i thank the senator from california. she and i will talk some more. i think we have stated the similarity in our positions, which is our opposition to the cotton amendment, and the difference in our positions. she sees it as intricately related to the iran nuclear agreement, which she passionately supports, and i see it as a separate issue because i oppose the iran agreement. i don't think we will work that out in public here over the next hour and a half, so i suggest we continue our conversations between us, the majority, and the democratic leader, and see where we get by 5:30 p.m. my hope is that we can dispose of the cotton amendment, finish the bill, and get on with the other important business of the senate sooner rather than later. i thank the senator. the presiding officer. the senator from oregon. remembering bob bennett mr. wyden. madam president, i wish to make some remarks about our wonderful colleague who passed away last week, senator bob bennett. two of senator bennett's favorite senators are here on the floor this afternoon--senator feinstein and senator alexander. what senator bennett liked so much about senator alexander and senator feinstein is what we have seen this afternoon. the two of them have a difference of opinion with respect, i gather, to the iran deal. i happen to share senator feinstein's view, but the two of them are trying to find common ground here in the senate. that is the senate at its best, and that is exactly what bob bennett liked so much about both my colleague from california and my colleague from tennessee. so i think it is very fitting that i open my remarks about senator bennett after having listened once again to the chair and ranking member talk about how the senate is supposed to do business. there are so many wonderful things to say about bob bennett, but i thought i would begin by talking about senator bennett's favorite subject because of something he created. he saw it is a great opportunity for the senate, and he called it the grand bargain. whenever i had a chance to sit down and talk with him--i had joined the finance committee--he would talk about the opportunities that were related to taxes. he often talked with senator alexander and me, as my colleague remembers. he talked to us about health care and taxes. he was very interested in innovation. by the way, i think he was one of the first senators who purchased a hybrid vehicle close to 20 years ago, and he used that discussion to branch into the kinds of building connections that you have to do when you are talking about how you are going to increase the standard of living for americans in a constantly changing world where you are really dealing with global economics. we don't just sell stuff to people down the street; we are competing against economic forces from all over the world. when senator bennett talked about his idea of a grand bargain--and you could be sitting with him in the senate dining room, for example, and he probably took out a napkin if he couldn't find a piece of paper--what he was interested in was what i call principled bipartisanship. in other words, nobody gets everything they want, but what you try to do is find principles that you feel strongly about and principles that the other side feels strongly about--and that is what senator alexander and senator feinstein were talking about this afternoon--and you find some common ground. it was very fortunate, as i look at my career in public service, that i had a chance to work with bob bennett. i will tell you, the way i see it, there was no better grand bargain in life than a friendship with bob bennett. we differed on plenty of stuff, just as i am sure senator feinstein and senator alexander differ on matters. bob would always say: ron is pro-choice, i am pro-life; ron was against the iraq war, i was for the iraq war. but we didn't spend our time arguing about those kinds of things. what we were interested in was finding ways to solve problems. i remember one example that i think my colleagues on the floor remember as well. back at the time of y2k, the turn of the century--oh, my goodness, one would have thought that western civilization was going to end. we were going to have this technology meltdown. it was going to be chaos around the world. well, there were two bills at the time, two pieces of legislation. there was a bill from our former colleague, senator dodd, and senator bennett. i was a young upstart member of the commerce committee. senator mccain, knowing my interest in technology policy, basically gave me a great honor by saying ``why don't you be my running mate?'' because he was the chairman of the committee. so there were two bills; one was senator mccain and i as the junior running mate, and the other was bob bennett and chris dodd. everybody said there was going to be all kinds of fighting among the four of us. nobody is going to agree. nobody will pass a piece of legislation, and the country, as a result, will not be prepared. well, because of bob--i basically was the newcomer to the senate. this was a big, important piece of legislation. bob and chris dodd and senator mccain basically said: we are not going to have any part of some bickerfest here in the u.s. senate; we are going to solve a problem. and they did. you bet, it picked up opposition. there were some folks on the progressive side who had reservations about some provisions, and there were some folks on the conservative side who had reservations about the legislation. we [[page s2613]] passed a bill. i remember going down to the y2k center that night and staying up all night. i can't claim that our legislation was responsible for such a smooth-running transition, but we like to think that the fact that the senate decided to set aside partisanship and actually get something done was constructive. the reality is that bob bennett firmly believed that he was elected to do more than just get reelected. i think that was right in the core of how he worked in the u.s. senate. i have been in public life awhile. i was the director of the gray panthers for a number of years when i was a young man with a full head of hair and rugged good looks. i was always dreaming about being a major part of health reform, so i put together a bill. i said: i think my party is right that we are never going to get health care fixed unless we have universal coverage; otherwise, it will be cost shifting, and there won't be prevention. but the republicans had a valid point, too, that there ought to be a role for the private sector. so i was talking to republicans, and senator alexander remembers these visits. i went in to see senator bennett, whom i watched on the floor talking about health care, and he sounded like someone who might be interested, but i still thought it was a long shot. i said: my god, he is a really conservative fellow from utah. he and a progressive fellow from oregon probably don't have much in common, except for the fact that they are both tall. i talked to him in his office. he later said to a newspaper person: i gave the closest thing that you do in the senate to convey that i really wasn't interested because you never say no, especially to somebody sincere. he said that a number of times. so he thought about it, and he spent time talking to people. i remember this as if it were yesterday because his seat was across the aisle, just a few seats away. he and senator rockefeller were the tallest senators at the time; senator kerry and i kind of came in--i don't know--third or fourth or something like that. he came bounding over and he said: i want to do this with you. and i did a kind of double take because i thought, i don't think i am hearing this right. he said: yes, you are talking about how the democrats are right about universal coverage, and i am going to have to get my side kind of acclimated to that, but you acknowledge that there ought to be a role somehow, some way for the private sector. i said: you bet, that was the point. he said: i am in. so one of his newspapers--in looking at all the kind things that have been said--said that bob bennett did so much good work. we hope what his career stood for was that you could find common ground and that the senate would remember going forward that bipartisanship is not a death sentence. bipartisanship is a chance to find a way to solve problems, whether it was y2k, which was exciting, or something else. i think it is worth mentioning, because i did a stint as chairman of the energy and natural resources committee, that bob bennett put together a truly impressive public lands bill. it involved one of his fast-growing counties--washington county--and several hundred thousand acres of wilderness, of land management, by the bureau of land management and the national park service alike. suffice it to say that when i heard about it for the first time, senator bennett asked for my help, and i thought, man, there is no way he is going to be able to move something like this because you had all the progressive environmental organizations, you had lots of people from the counties who of course resisted these sorts of things, and you had lots of challenges in the west putting together public lands policies. we saw it again here recently in eastern oregon. but bob bennett pulled it off. he pulled it off because he pretty much just smothered both sides with attention. each side would have a point. he would respond. he would send his staff down to talk to people. and those who wouldn't normally possibly agree came together and found common ground on public lands policy. i remember because the president signed it in 2009, senator bennett and i were in the back--i guess largely because we were the tallest-- and we talked about how unlikely it was that we would be there and that we would have all of these opportunities to serve together. as we remember bob bennett, my hope is we will understand, as did senator bennett, that, much like today, neither side had enough votes to get everything it wanted. that was the case then, and it continues to be the case today. he understood that no single party had a lock on all the good ideas, but rather than just shrug his shoulders or go out and race for a microphone in order to score some sort of quick political advantage, bob bennett, in his career in the senate, stood for what we call principled bipartisanship. i imagine there are going to be a number of farewells this week to a wonderful friend, a terrific senator, in my view, and an even better person. i just hope that apropos of what we have seen with senator feinstein and senator alexander, as they approach another big vote, let's put as much of our time and effort into finding common ground as possible. sometimes it can't be done. i get that, and bob bennett did too. but certainly we can put vastly more time and effort into finding common ground, pursuing what bob bennett was all about because he was a u.s. senator who gave public service a good name. with that, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from california. mrs. feinstein. madam president, if i may, i want to thank the senator from oregon for those remarks. my colleagues might be interested to know that i was chairman of rules, and bob was the ranking member, and this was during the period before the first inauguration of barack obama. as we all know, the rules committee is in charge of making the arrangements for the occasion. bob was really just a wonderful person to work with. in the first place, we worked really well together. we sat down, we went over the problems, and we talked about solutions. then came the subject of the senate lunch following the inaugural. well, i didn't pay much attention to it. then i realized that this was a huge thing. it was in national statuary hall. there were decorations. we had to get a fine painting. in this case, i arranged for it to be a great california landscape by thomas hill, which came from the museum in new york. to plan for it, there is something that has been traditional, which is the meal tasting, and senator bennett and his wonderful wife joyce and my husband and i went up to the fourth floor, and the table was set as it would be set at this lunch. we did a tasting from every culinary caterer who was bidding to do the lunch, believe it or not, and i think there were four of them. so there were four entrees and four salads and four desserts. and joyce and bob and dick and i sat there, and we went through the motions and did it. but it was with great humor. and the two of them together really were a very special couple. the senator from oregon knew him in a different way than i knew him. bob bennett truly was a man among men. he had a humility about him, but he also had a real can-do sense, and he really cared about his senate term. i know senator alexander knew him well. it was really wonderful for me on the rules committee because it was much the way the senator from tennessee is on energy and water appropriations. i had a chance to meet joyce and get to know her, and it was very special. i think we put on a very good inaugural--a bipartisan inaugural, if you will--and i just want to say thank you, senator. mr. wyden. thank you. mrs. feinstein. because this really was a man who didn't participate in any obstruction or any difficulty. he was always positive and always willing to do his part and to help. that is really very special. i would like to give my best to his family and his friends. the state of utah had a wonderful senator in bob bennett, and he will be missed. thank you, madam president. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [[page s2614]] mr. flake. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. coats). without objection, it is so ordered. american manufacturing competitiveness act mr. flake. mr. president, i come to the floor today to speak in support of legislation reforming the mtb, or the miscellaneous tariff benefit process. i am pleased to help this legislation advance. it is my hope that this bill will soon be on the president's desk. as many will remember, a dark cloud hung over the congress with regard to the practice of earmarking in early 2009. the feeding at the earmark trough had long since expanded to the point of ridiculousness. earmarks exploded to their annual record of $29 billion in 2006. they were long a problem before that, but it had become much, much worse at that time. congress had become accustomed to powerful members getting a large chunk of the earmark pie, and rank-and-file members would fight over the scraps. we saw less and less true oversight as more and more spending was doled out in congressional back rooms. it wasn't just spending on earmarks that we didn't have good oversight on. it was the entire federal budget. it was largely a problem because so much of our time in congress was spent doling out earmarks and making sure that every member got a few and that they were scattered around. we really gave up on the oversight that we should have been conducting. at the same time, earmarks opponents had ample opportunity to shame the process by highlighting bridges to nowhere, teapot museums, and the national cowgirl hall of fame, for example, receiving these earmarks. but attention on the issue focused sharply in early february of 2009, when reports surfaced that a lobbying firm specializing in defense appropriations had been raided by the fbi. the new york times noted that the firm ``set up shop at the busy intersection between political fund-raising and taxpayer spending, directing tens of millions of dollars in contributions to lawmakers, while steering hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks contracts back to his clients.'' the cloud over congress darkened even further with suggestions of pay-to-play straw-man contributions, the reimbursing of employees for political contributions, and pressuring others for political giving. in quick succession, both the house and the senate rightly put in place a moratorium over all earmarks, a ban that has remained intact ever since. while we gladly said goodbye to the bad old days of congressional porkbarrel spending, we soon found out that there were several things that congress only knew how to do through earmarking. this included the so-called miscellaneous tariff benefits, or mtbs. mtbs are provisions that, when signed into law, provide tariff and duty relief for imports that are not domestically produced. the historic mtb process benefited from a consensus-driven process administered by the international trade commission that, for the most part, set it apart from the much ridiculed federal largesse doled out by earmarking. unfortunately, the original process also required that an original bill be introduced by a member of congress--a specific bill for a specific tariff reduction, often to benefit a particular for- profit company. i have long held that doing away with these individual bills and establishing an mtb process that relies on the itc to accept and review proposals over which congress has final say would be preferable. such an approach would both comply with the earmark moratorium while providing taxpayers a measure of confidence that undue influence was not being inappropriately exerted. i am pleased to have the opportunity to work with both house and senate leadership and with members of the senate finance committee and the house committee on ways and means on moving such a proposal forward. to be clear, my goals of being an original cosponsor of the american manufacturing competitiveness act of 2016 and vocally supporting moving forward with legislation reforming the mtb process is twofold. first and foremost, cutting tariffs is the right thing to do. in fact, i would support permanent tariff reductions as a means of furthering the benefits of free trade and lightening the burden on u.s. producers. in addition, the longer we go without being able to move forward with mtb bills, the more threatened the earmark moratorium is. i wish i could say that all members of congress are willing to permanently walk away from this wayward process of congressional earmarking, but that is not the case. those wishing to go back to the bad old days will use any excuse to support ending the earmark moratorium. reforming the mtb process not only provides a path for much needed tariff relief and a modicum of confidence for taxpayers, but it is also good for the long-term survival of the earmark moratorium. i am pleased to be a part of this effort moving forward. the house companion legislation passed with overwhelming support. i believe there were only two dissenting votes in the house. it is my hope that the senate will soon follow suit. i yield back the remainder of my time. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. ms.

JAMES RICHARDSON Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the career of Dr. James ``Jim'' Richardson, who is retiring from the University of Nevada, Reno, UNR, this year. Dr. Richardson is stepping down from his positions as director of judicial studies and foundation professor of sociology and judicial studies after 48 years of service to UNR. His commitment and dedication to the judicial studies and justice management programs have been invaluable in preparing students for careers in the justice system. Dr. Richardson has enriched the lives of hundreds of students, including the many undergraduate students he introduced to the field of sociology and the doctoral candidates he mentored as they completed their dissertations. In addition to his teaching activities, Dr. Richardson has been a prolific researcher and writer. He was among the first researchers to focus on new religious movements. He has been praised for his interdisciplinary approach to sociology, particularly for his incorporation of subjects such as law, psychology, and economics into the study of religion. Dr. Richardson has authored or coauthored 9 books, more than 150 articles, and 85 book chapters. In addition, he has held nearly 350 presentations in almost 30 countries. Through his work, Dr. Richardson has made important contributions to the scholarship of sociology and has enriched academia as a whole. Dr. Richardson has had an impact on the practice of law and the justice system in more direct settings as well. For instance, he has served as an expert witness on a variety of legal cases. He has also been a consultant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and has worked to help law enforcement officials better understand the interaction between the justice system and religious groups. In addition, Dr. Richardson has researched several issues for the Nevada Supreme Court. I congratulate Dr. Richardson on his many successes and decades of dedicated service to UNR and to the Silver State. Both the justice system and academia have benefitted from his work, and I wish him the best in his retirement and future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2615] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DR.

CREC-2016-05-09-pt1-PgS2616,CREC-2016-05-09,114,ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2616-S2619] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification, the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations Committee, room SD-423. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Arlington, VA. Hon. Bob Corker, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements of Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended, we are forwarding herewith Transmittal No. 16-34, concerning the Department of the Army's proposed Letter(s) of Offer and Acceptance to France for defense articles and services estimated to cost $72 million.

Non-MDE items included in this request are: Hellfire Missile conversion kits; blast fragmentation sleeves and installation kits; containers; and transportation. (iv) Military Department: Army (FR-B-WAA, Amendment 8). (v) Prior Related Cases, if any: FR-B-WAA-$42.2M-09 JAN 08. (vi) Sales Commission, Fee, etc., Paid, Offered, or Agreed to be Paid: None. (vii) Sensitivity of Technology Contained in the Defense Article or Defense Services Proposed to be Sold: See Attached Annex. (viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: April 29 2016. *As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control Act. POLICY JUSTIFICATION The Government of France--Hellfire Missiles The Government of France previously requested the potential sale of one hundred twelve (112) AGM-114K1A Hellfire Missiles, one hundred two (102) AGM-114NIA Hellfire Missiles, fifty (50) ATM-114Q1A Hellfire Training Missiles. Non-MDE consists of four (4) Hellfire Missile Mock-Up Sectional Models. four (4) Hellfire II AGM-114N Warhead Mock-Ups, thirty (30) Hellfire M36-E4 Training Missiles, sixty (60) Hellfire M60 Dummy Missiles, M299 Launcher Spare Parts (O and I Level), Hellfire Missile Spare Parts (O and I Level), M36-- 4 Training Missile Spare Parts (O and I Level), Integrated Logistics Support Hardware Equipment, Training, U.S. Government Technical Assistance, one hundred (100) Dome Covers, three (3) Hellfire AGM-114K1A Warhead Sections, three (3) Hellfire AGM-114N1 Warhead Sections, thirty (30) LASS Simulators, three (3) AN-205Bs, forty-four (44) IRIS, three (3) Calibration Cables, AN-205B Test Equipment Spare Parts, AGM-114N1 Warheads without Electronic Safe, Arm and Fire Device, thirteen (13) AGM-114K1A Main Warheads with No Control Interface Group, thirteen (13) AGM-114K1A Precursors, Hellfire Tripod Launcher with Launch Control without Laser, Technical Data Documentation, Publications, Repair and Return Services, Classified Technical Data Package, Unanticipated and Unprogrammed Requirements, sixteen (16) Hellfire II AGM- 114K1A Missile Sleeves, Hellfire M60 Dummy Missile Spare Parts, sixty (60) M34 Hellfire Training Missile, and Conversion Services for M34 Dummy Missiles. The MDE value of these items was $20 million; the total implemented value of the initial case and amendments was $42 million. Of the items listed above, France has already received (via a below Congressional threshold-level FMS case, FR-B-WAA) one-hundred and twelve (112) AGM-114K1A Hellfire Missiles, one hundred two (102) AGM-114N1A Hellfire Missiles, fifty (50) ATM-114Q1A Hellfire Training Missiles, Hellfire Missile conversion kits, blast fragmentation sleeves and installation kits, containers, and transportation. France has requested that this existing FMS case, FR-B-WAA, be amended with the possible sale of two-hundred (200) AGM- 114K1A Hellfire Missiles, Hellfire Missile conversion, blast fragmentation sleeves and installation kits, containers, and transportation. The estimated MDE cost in this amendment is $25 million. The total estimated cost is $30 million. As the amendment requested by France will raise the value of FR-B-WAA over the Congressional notification threshold, this transmittal notifies what will be the total quantities and value of the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) with this proposed amendment. The estimated cost of MDE is $45 million. The total estimated cost is $72 million. This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the capability of a NATO ally. France is a major political and economic power in Europe and a key democratic partner of the United States in ensuring peace and stability around the world. It is vital to the U.S. national interest to assist France to develop and maintain a strong and ready self- defense capability. The additional missiles will meet France's operational requirements for a precision-guided tactical missile for its Tigre Attack Helicopter. The purchase will directly support French forces actively engaged in operations in Mali and Northern Africa, providing them the capability to successfully engage targets with minimal collateral damage. France will have no difficulty absorbing these missiles into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region. There is no principal contractor for this sale as the missiles are coming from U.S. Army stock. There are no known offset agreements in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will not require any additional U.S. Government or contractor representatives in France. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale.

Bob Corker, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements of Section 36(b)(5)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), as amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 0H-16. This notification relates to enhancements or upgrades from the level of sensitivity of technology or capability described in the Section 36(b)(1) AECA certification 14-18 of 07 July 2014. Sincerely, J.W. Rixey, Vice Admiral, USN, Director. Enclosures. [[Page S2617]] Transmittal No. 0H-16 Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(A), AECA) i. Purchaser: Government of Singapore ii. Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 14-18; Date: 07 July 2014; Military Department: Air Force. iii. Description: On 07 July 2014, Congress was notified by Congressional certification transmittal number 14-18, of the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) of nine-hundred and thirteen (913) KMU-556 B/B Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits for Mk-84 2000 lb bombs, one-hundred (100) FMU-152A/B Live Fuzes, and three- hundred (300) DSU-40 Laser Precision Guidance Set. Also included were containers, munition trailers, support equipment, spare and repair parts, support and test equipment, publications and technical documentation, personnel training and training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor engineering and technical support, and other related elements of logistical and program support.

There is no increase in the total estimated MDE cost or total estimated program cost. iv. Significance: This report is being provided because at the time of the original notification, Singapore was not approved for anti-jam capability. Singapore received DoD approval for anti-jam capability on 22 October 2015. v. Justification: This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a major Southeast Asian partner in counterterrorism and an important force for political stability and economic progress in South East Asia. vi. Date Report Delivered to Congress: MAY 02, 2016. Transmittal No. 0H-16 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology 1. The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is not a stand- alone weapon. It is a ``bolt-on'' guidance package that converts unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). Weapon accuracy is dependent on target coordinates and present position coordinates entered into the guidance control unit. The Inertial Navigation System (INS), using updates from the Global Positioning System (GPS), helps guide the bomb to the target via the use of movable tails fins. With the addition of a laser guidance nose kit, the JDAM is able to engage moving targets. The JDAM all-up-round (AUR) (JDAM kit, unguided bomb body, and tail fuze) is UNCLASSIFIED; technical data for JDAM is classified up to SECRET. 2. This transmittal reports the enhancement of the KMU-556 F/B JDAM kits to include anti-jam Global Positioning System (GPS) capability. The KMU-556 F/B Tail Kit with Global Positioning System Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module with Anti-jam (GPS/SAASM/AJ) is the tail kit for the GBU-31F(V) 1/B and GBU-56 F (V)/B. Information revealing SAASM implementation details are classified SECRET. 3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the information could be used to develop countermeasures which might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capabilities. 4. A determination has been made that the recipient country can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 5. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for release and export to Singapore. ____ Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Arlington, Va. Hon. Paul D.

Date Report Delivered to Congress: MAY 02, 2016. Transmittal No. 0H-16 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology 1. The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is not a stand- alone weapon. It is a ``bolt-on'' guidance package that converts unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). Weapon accuracy is dependent on target coordinates and present position coordinates entered into the guidance control unit. The Inertial Navigation System (INS), using updates from the Global Positioning System (GPS), helps guide the bomb to the target via the use of movable tails fins. With the addition of a laser guidance nose kit, the JDAM is able to engage moving targets. The JDAM all-up-round (AUR) (JDAM kit, unguided bomb body, and tail fuze) is UNCLASSIFIED; technical data for JDAM is classified up to SECRET. 2. This transmittal reports the enhancement of the KMU-556 F/B JDAM kits to include anti-jam Global Positioning System (GPS) capability. The KMU-556 F/B Tail Kit with Global Positioning System Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module with Anti-jam (GPS/SAASM/AJ) is the tail kit for the GBU-31F(V) 1/B and GBU-56 F (V)/B. Information revealing SAASM implementation details are classified SECRET. 3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the information could be used to develop countermeasures which might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capabilities. 4. A determination has been made that the recipient country can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 5. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for release and export to Singapore. ____ Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Arlington, Va. Hon. Paul D.

Transmittal No. 0H-16 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology 1. The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is not a stand- alone weapon. It is a ``bolt-on'' guidance package that converts unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). Weapon accuracy is dependent on target coordinates and present position coordinates entered into the guidance control unit. The Inertial Navigation System (INS), using updates from the Global Positioning System (GPS), helps guide the bomb to the target via the use of movable tails fins. With the addition of a laser guidance nose kit, the JDAM is able to engage moving targets. The JDAM all-up-round (AUR) (JDAM kit, unguided bomb body, and tail fuze) is UNCLASSIFIED; technical data for JDAM is classified up to SECRET. 2. This transmittal reports the enhancement of the KMU-556 F/B JDAM kits to include anti-jam Global Positioning System (GPS) capability. The KMU-556 F/B Tail Kit with Global Positioning System Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module with Anti-jam (GPS/SAASM/AJ) is the tail kit for the GBU-31F(V) 1/B and GBU-56 F (V)/B. Information revealing SAASM implementation details are classified SECRET. 3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the information could be used to develop countermeasures which might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capabilities. 4. A determination has been made that the recipient country can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 5. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for release and export to Singapore. ____ Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Arlington, Va. Hon. Paul D.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize CWO2 John S. Heffernan, Retired, for his leadership and dedication to our State and Nation as a soldier, a veteran, and a volunteer. He is truly a public servant. Mr. Heffernan enlisted in the Army in 1962 and began his military career with basic training at Fort Chaffee, AR. He completed telecommunications training at Fort Gordon, GA, and then served as a cryptographer in the 33rd Signal Battalion at Fort Richardson, AK. Mr. Heffernan was discharged from the Army on March 19, 1965, and briefly assigned to the U.S. Army Reserve Control Group, Reinforcement, before joining the Arkansas National Guard less than a week later. He served as a personnel staff noncommissioned officer, ultimately reaching the enlisted rank of sergeant first class, E-7. In 1980, Mr. Heffernan was appointed as a warrant officer and served as a military personnel technician and later promoted to the rank of chief warrant officer 2. After completing more than 27 years of military service and approximately 25 years as a fulltime, dual status military technician for the Arkansas Army National Guard, Mr. Heffernan retired as a servicemember and as a civil service employee and was transferred to the U.S. Army Reserve Control Group, Retired Reserves, in 1990. Shortly after his retirement, Mr. Heffernan went back to work as a family assistance officer at Fisher Armory in North Little Rock in support of the 148th Evacuation Hospital and the 25th Rear Operations Center, during their deployment to Desert Shield/Desert Storm. Following Desert Storm, Mr. Heffernan saw the need to assist military retirees and their families, so for the next 5 years, he provided his voluntary services at Camp Robinson in North Little Rock. After his time at Camp Robinson, Mr. Heffernan spent the next 18 years, providing voluntary retirement services at the Little Rock Air Force Base, becoming the director of retiree activities in 2000. Mr. Heffernan has been a tireless advocate and the go-to person in central Arkansas for all matters related to military retirees and their families. In April, Mr. Heffernan retired as a volunteer, but remains active in the military and veteran community by serving as the retiree representative on the board of directors for the National Guard Association of Arkansas. For more than half of a century, Mr. Heffernan has been a selfless servant to others. I take this opportunity to recognize and say thank you to CW2 John S. Heffernan, Retired, for his service to Arkansas, our Nation, and his fellow man. May God continue to bless him in his retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2619] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ TRIBUTE TO CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER 2 JOHN HEFFERNAN Mr. BOOZMAN.

After his time at Camp Robinson, Mr. Heffernan spent the next 18 years, providing voluntary retirement services at the Little Rock Air Force Base, becoming the director of retiree activities in 2000. Mr. Heffernan has been a tireless advocate and the go-to person in central Arkansas for all matters related to military retirees and their families. In April, Mr. Heffernan retired as a volunteer, but remains active in the military and veteran community by serving as the retiree representative on the board of directors for the National Guard Association of Arkansas. For more than half of a century, Mr. Heffernan has been a selfless servant to others. I take this opportunity to recognize and say thank you to CW2 John S. Heffernan, Retired, for his service to Arkansas, our Nation, and his fellow man. May God continue to bless him in his retirement. ____________________",package_114_174.csv,2902,2902,2966,"[congressional record volume 162, number 72 (monday, may 9, 2016)] [senate] [page s2619] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] additional statements ______ tribute to chief warrant officer 2 john heffernan mr. boozman. mr. president, today i wish to recognize cwo2 john s. heffernan, retired, for his leadership and dedication to our state and nation as a soldier, a veteran, and a volunteer. he is truly a public servant. mr. heffernan enlisted in the army in 1962 and began his military career with basic training at fort chaffee, ar. he completed telecommunications training at fort gordon, ga, and then served as a cryptographer in the 33rd signal battalion at fort richardson, ak. mr. heffernan was discharged from the army on march 19, 1965, and briefly assigned to the u.s. army reserve control group, reinforcement, before joining the arkansas national guard less than a week later. he served as a personnel staff noncommissioned officer, ultimately reaching the enlisted rank of sergeant first class, e-7. in 1980, mr. heffernan was appointed as a warrant officer and served as a military personnel technician and later promoted to the rank of chief warrant officer 2. after completing more than 27 years of military service and approximately 25 years as a fulltime, dual status military technician for the arkansas army national guard, mr. heffernan retired as a servicemember and as a civil service employee and was transferred to the u.s. army reserve control group, retired reserves, in 1990. shortly after his retirement, mr. heffernan went back to work as a family assistance officer at fisher armory in north little rock in support of the 148th evacuation hospital and the 25th rear operations center, during their deployment to desert shield/desert storm. following desert storm, mr. heffernan saw the need to assist military retirees and their families, so for the next 5 years, he provided his voluntary services at camp robinson in north little rock. after his time at camp robinson, mr. heffernan spent the next 18 years, providing voluntary retirement services at the little rock air force base, becoming the director of retiree activities in 2000. mr. heffernan has been a tireless advocate and the go-to person in central arkansas for all matters related to military retirees and their families. in april, mr. heffernan retired as a volunteer, but remains active in the military and veteran community by serving as the retiree representative on the board of directors for the national guard association of arkansas. for more than half of a century, mr. heffernan has been a selfless servant to others. i take this opportunity to recognize and say thank you to cw2 john s. heffernan, retired, for his service to arkansas, our nation, and his fellow man. may god continue to bless him in his retirement. ____________________",2902
CREC-2016-05-09-pt1-PgS2619-3,CREC-2016-05-09,114,100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAN DIEGO ZOO GLOBAL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2619-S2620] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAN DIEGO ZOO GLOBAL Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join Senator Feinstein and me in recognizing the centennial of the San Diego Zoo Global, a world-class facility dedicated to providing expert animal care and promoting wildlife conservation. Founded in 1916, the San Diego Zoo Global began as a sanctuary for abandoned animals left behind after the Panama-California Exposition held in San Diego. The zoo expanded quickly, opening its doors to rare and exotic animals donated by private owners, purchased from circuses and other zoos, and rescued from the wild. In the 1950s, zoo director Dr. Charles Schroeder had the idea of exhibiting animals in a large, free-range habitat that provided space for breeding and conservation research. His dream became a reality in 1972 with the opening of the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, a one-of-a-kind 1,800-acre habitat that is now home to more than 3,200 animals. Over half of the park has been set aside as protected native species habitat. Throughout the years, the San Diego Zoo Global has played a critical role in preserving rare wildlife and habitats through its Institute for Conservation Research, housed in the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center for Conservation Research. Founded in 1975, the institute is one of the largest zoo-based research centers in the world and has led several successful efforts to protect some of the world's most endangered species, including the magnificent California condor. The zoo led the effort to save the condor by designing and implementing a successful 25-year captive-breeding process that reintroduced the species to its native habitat. At the start of the program, the California condor was near extinction; today the current condor population is more than 420, with approximately 200 living in the wild in California, Arizona, Utah, and Mexico. The San Diego Zoo Global is also making an immediate and lasting impact in our Nation's classrooms. Each year, the San Diego Zoo and the Institute for Conservation Research hosts a workshop for middle and high school teachers from across the United States. This hands-on experience allows educators to develop innovative lessons in conservation to bring back to their students. Over the past 100 years, the San Diego Zoo Global has opened its doors to millions of visitors from around the [[Page S2620]] globe, setting a new standard for zoological institutions worldwide. Senator Feinstein and I want to congratulate the staff, volunteers, and supporters of this extraordinary organization for the important role they play in the care and preservation of our earth's most beautiful creatures and habitats. We know their work will continue to make a profound difference for generations to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2619-S2620] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAN DIEGO ZOO GLOBAL Mrs. BOXER.

I commend his bravery and fortitude during times of tragedy, specifically his direction during the South Canyon fire. Additionally, his work with local and State officials developed and implemented some of Colorado's most significant fire prevention and safety programs.

CREC-2016-05-09-pt1-PgS2620,CREC-2016-05-09,114,"REMEMBERING SAMUEL STATEN, SENIOR","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2620] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING SAMUEL STATEN, SENIOR Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I remember the distinguished life and career of Mr. Samuel Staten, Sr., who passed away at the age of 80 on Tuesday, April 26, 2016. Sam was not only a trusted adviser and dedicated father, but a pillar of strength for thousands in the labor movement and Philadelphia. I would like to take this time to not only send my condolences to his family, but to reflect upon his remarkable life. He spent 50 years in the labor industry and dedicated his career to strengthening the rights of workers and the bonds of friendship between the communities of Philadelphia. He worked his entire life for the betterment of his fellow workers and experienced firsthand the hardships that inadequate wages and benefits can have on hard-working Americans. Sam's presence was felt in the labor movement long before his time as one of Philadelphia's most prominent civic leaders. He spent 10 years as a construction laborer in Philadelphia in the 1960s and remembered working for $2.60 an hour, without health care, without a pension plan, without any of the support many of our Nation's workers have come to enjoy today. His experience in the transformative decade of the sixties showed him not only the importance of the labor movement, but the power that collective action can have for the well-being of the community and the Nation. Following 10 years as a construction worker, Sam's capacity for leadership and his ability to unite people were recognized when he became a field representative for Laborers' Local 332 in 1970. His skills and leadership helped him to quickly rise through the ranks, and in 1973, he was appointed assistant business manager for Local 332. The high esteem in which he was held by his colleagues continued to be evident in 1978 when he was elected business manager for Local 332 and held that position until 2008. He also served as the secretary- treasurer of the Laborers' District Council of the Metropolitan Area of Philadelphia & Vicinity. He officially retired from Laborers Local 332 and the Laborers' District Council in 2010. Never one to narrow his focus to just one area, he brought his leadership and insight to countless other organizations. Over the years, he served as a trustee of the Laborers' District Council Building & Construction Health & Welfare Fund, delegate to the Philadelphia Building & Construction Trades Council, board member of the Philadelphia Housing Authority, member of the African-American Chamber of Commerce, trustee of the Laborers' District Council Building & Construction Pension Fund, board member of the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority, and member of the Pennsylvania Prevailing Wage Appeals Board. These represent only a few of the many organizations to which Sam lent his support, but show the extensive influence and support he has given to the Philadelphia area. Given the breadth of his dedication to the workers and people of Philadelphia, it is unsurprising that his leadership extended even further through charitable work. He helped to found the Laborers' District Council Charity Fund through an act that, though remarkable, was typical of Sam. At a 1987 Friends of Labor Committee dinner held in his honor, Sam was presented with $25,000 for his service over the years. However, he saw the gift not as a chance to help himself, but an opportunity to improve the lives of others. He chose to donate the money to charity, which in turn inspired his colleagues and gave birth to the Laborers' District Council Charity Fund. Renamed the Samuel Staten, Sr., Charitable Trust in 2011, the organization continues to provide thousands of dollars in services and scholarships to Local 332 members in need. Throughout his life he fought for the dignity and well-being of hard- working Americans and, regardless of his success, never forgot his roots in the labor movement. He experienced both great success and hardship, but regardless of the hand he was dealt, he always saw an opportunity to extend that hand to others in need. As he rose through the ranks of Local 332, he brought together diverse communities and labor interests for the benefit of the community. Even when confronted with the tragic death of his son, Qaid Staten, Sam's dedication to the community could not be diminished. His son was killed just months before he was to attend Howard University, but Sam chose to honor his son not through grief, but through the creation of the Qaid Staten Memorial Scholarship Fund, which continues to provide support to other young students preparing to enter college. Sam's life was a story of uncommon acts of kindness in service of the common good. On behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a grateful nation, I would like to once again extend my deepest condolences to the family of Samuel Staten, Sr. Philadelphia and the Nation may have lost a distinguished leader, dedicated public servant, and devoted father and grandfather, but we will never lose the positive change he brought to the city of Philadelphia, the impact he had on the lives of thousands, nor the legacy of idealism, compassion, and community service that he has left so others may continue to fight for the causes of dignity and equality to which he dedicated his life. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2620] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING SAMUEL STATEN, SENIOR Mr. CASEY.

Over the years, he served as a trustee of the Laborers' District Council Building & Construction Health & Welfare Fund, delegate to the Philadelphia Building & Construction Trades Council, board member of the Philadelphia Housing Authority, member of the African-American Chamber of Commerce, trustee of the Laborers' District Council Building & Construction Pension Fund, board member of the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority, and member of the Pennsylvania Prevailing Wage Appeals Board. These represent only a few of the many organizations to which Sam lent his support, but show the extensive influence and support he has given to the Philadelphia area. Given the breadth of his dedication to the workers and people of Philadelphia, it is unsurprising that his leadership extended even further through charitable work. He helped to found the Laborers' District Council Charity Fund through an act that, though remarkable, was typical of Sam. At a 1987 Friends of Labor Committee dinner held in his honor, Sam was presented with $25,000 for his service over the years. However, he saw the gift not as a chance to help himself, but an opportunity to improve the lives of others. He chose to donate the money to charity, which in turn inspired his colleagues and gave birth to the Laborers' District Council Charity Fund. Renamed the Samuel Staten, Sr., Charitable Trust in 2011, the organization continues to provide thousands of dollars in services and scholarships to Local 332 members in need. Throughout his life he fought for the dignity and well-being of hard- working Americans and, regardless of his success, never forgot his roots in the labor movement. He experienced both great success and hardship, but regardless of the hand he was dealt, he always saw an opportunity to extend that hand to others in need. As he rose through the ranks of Local 332, he brought together diverse communities and labor interests for the benefit of the community. Even when confronted with the tragic death of his son, Qaid Staten, Sam's dedication to the community could not be diminished. His son was killed just months before he was to attend Howard University, but Sam chose to honor his son not through grief, but through the creation of the Qaid Staten Memorial Scholarship Fund, which continues to provide support to other young students preparing to enter college. Sam's life was a story of uncommon acts of kindness in service of the common good. On behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a grateful nation, I would like to once again extend my deepest condolences to the family of Samuel Staten, Sr. Philadelphia and the Nation may have lost a distinguished leader, dedicated public servant, and devoted father and grandfather, but we will never lose the positive change he brought to the city of Philadelphia, the impact he had on the lives of thousands, nor the legacy of idealism, compassion, and community service that he has left so others may continue to fight for the causes of dignity and equality to which he dedicated his life. ____________________",package_114_174.csv,5496,5496,5560,"[congressional record volume 162, number 72 (monday, may 9, 2016)] [senate] [page s2620] from the congressional record online through

away at the age of 80 on tuesday, april 26, 2016. sam was not only a trusted adviser and dedicated father, but a pillar of strength for thousands in the labor movement and philadelphia. i would like to take this time to not only send my condolences to his family, but to reflect upon his remarkable life. he spent 50 years in the labor industry and dedicated his career to strengthening the rights of workers and the bonds of friendship between the communities of philadelphia. he worked his entire life for the betterment of his fellow workers and experienced firsthand the hardships that inadequate wages and benefits can have on hard-working americans. sam's presence was felt in the labor movement long before his time as one of philadelphia's most prominent civic leaders. he spent 10 years as a construction laborer in philadelphia in the 1960s and remembered working for $2.60 an hour, without health care, without a pension plan, without any of the support many of our nation's workers have come to enjoy today. his experience in the transformative decade of the sixties showed him not only the importance of the labor movement, but the power that collective action can have for the well-being of the community and the nation. following 10 years as a construction worker, sam's capacity for leadership and his ability to unite people were recognized when he became a field representative for laborers' local 332 in 1970. his skills and leadership helped him to quickly rise through the ranks, and in 1973, he was appointed assistant business manager for local 332. the high esteem in which he was held by his colleagues continued to be evident in 1978 when he was elected business manager for local 332 and held that position until 2008. he also served as the secretary- treasurer of the laborers' district council of the metropolitan area of philadelphia & vicinity. he officially retired from laborers local 332 and the laborers' district council in 2010. never one to narrow his focus to just one area, he brought his leadership and insight to countless other organizations. over the years, he served as a trustee of the laborers' district council building & construction health & welfare fund, delegate to the philadelphia building & construction trades council, board member of the philadelphia housing authority, member of the african-american chamber of commerce, trustee of the laborers' district council building & construction pension fund, board member of the pennsylvania convention center authority, and member of the pennsylvania prevailing wage appeals board. these represent only a few of the many organizations to which sam lent his support, but show the extensive influence and support he has given to the philadelphia area. given the breadth

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Afton, MN, flotilla of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year. Established in 1941, this flotilla is the oldest in Minnesota. The volunteers of the Coast Guard Auxiliary dedicate their time to making sure our community's lakes and rivers are safe. As the Land of 10,000 Lakes, flotillas in Minnesota have a fulltime job. From performing search and rescue operations, to teaching boating safety courses, for 75 years, the Afton flotilla has helped to ensure that Minnesota waterways are safe and accessible. Over the years, when our State has faced natural disasters such as flooding of the Mississippi River and the Red River, the Afton flotilla has worked side-by-side with local, State, and Federal authorities to aid in search and rescue operations, evacuations, and emergency communications. When the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis tragically collapsed in [[Page S2621]] 2007, the volunteers of the Afton flotilla were ready to work with emergency response teams and helped catalog the countless amount of debris examined during the investigation. Even after the disaster was over, the flotilla monitored boater safety once the river was finally reopened. Even more than responding to disasters, the Afton flotilla works to prevent disasters on the water, making sure that river navigation tools are in working order and patrolling during regattas and other events. There is no way for us to know just how many lives were saved over the past 75 years through the hard work of the Afton flotilla volunteers. I join all of my fellow Minnesotans in applauding the Afton flotilla's momentous anniversary and the dedication of its volunteer members over the past 75 years. I would also like to thank all of the auxiliary volunteers in Minnesota and across the country who keep our communities and waterways safe. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2620-S2621] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE TWIN CITIES DIVISION OF THE COAST GUARD AUXILIARY Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

NORTON, USA, RETIRED Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to honor COL Robert F. Norton, USA, Retired, on the occasion of his retirement as deputy director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America, MOAA. After serving in the Army Reserve for several years while he worked as a schoolteacher, Colonel Norton volunteered for full-time Active Duty with the Army in 1978. He served in various assignments on the Army headquarters staff and the office of the Secretary of the Army, specializing in Reserve manpower and personnel policy matters. He served two tours in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, first as a personnel policy officer and then as senior military assistant to the Assistant Secretary. Colonel Norton retired from the Army in 1995. His military awards include the Legion of Merit, Defense Superior Service Medal, Bronze Star, Vietnam Service Medal, and the Armed Forces Reserve Medal. He is a graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, the Army War College, and the Kennedy School of Government senior officials in national security course at Harvard University. After his retirement, Colonel Norton continued his service as a defense contractor for 2 years, including time in Bosnia and other locations, but he found his true calling when he joined MOAA's government relations staff in 1997, specializing in National Guard, Reserve, and veterans benefits issues. In his nearly 19 years with MOAA, Colonel Norton testified before Congress more than 30 times and played a major role in a wide array of legislative accomplishments. Foremost among these was the post-9/11 GI Bill, where Colonel Norton's efforts played a pivotal role in ensuring this legislation included provisions for the Guard and Reserve, as well as transferability of benefits to family members. Colonel Norton also played a key role in winning legislation extending military health coverage to members of the Guard and Reserve and their families and authorizing early retirement credit for Guard and Reserve members called up for combat zone service. Colonel Norton's 38 years of service to our country and to those who serve and have served in uniform, as well as their families and survivors, is in keeping with the highest standards of excellence and is worthy of special recognition as he and his spouse, Colleen, embark on the next phase of their lives. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2621] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ROBERT F.

Levingston was born on November 13, 1905, to Frank and Ida Levingston in Cotton Valley, LA. He was one of seven children. Along with his younger siblings, Levingston helped to maintain approximately 200 acres of land, which remains in his family today. When the United States entered World War II after the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, Levingston enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942, where he dutifully served as a private and automobile serviceman during World War II and participated in the Allied invasion of Italy. After his honorable discharge from the Army in 1945, he became a union worker specializing in cement finishing. In 1981 Levingston moved to Lake Charles, LA, which he called home for the rest of his life. As the oldest living World War II veteran, Levingston saw many changes and much growth during his lifetime, including the Great Depression, the Jim Crow era, and the civil rights movement. In November 2015, he was invited by Austin, TX, Honor Flight to travel to Washington, DC, to visit the White House and lay a wreath at the National World War II Monument in remembrance of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

LAURANT Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Ms. Margaret N. Laurant, of Slidell, LA. Ms. Laurant was born in Bonfouca, LA, in 1926 to Jean and Elmonia Narcisse, both of whom were direct descendants of original French settlers of Bofouca. Ms. Laurant is the last remaining of her nine siblings and currently serves as the matriarch of the Narcisse family. As a young child, Ms. Laurant dealt with racism firsthand. She recalls attending a small segregated one-room school called the Golden Key. Later she attended middle school at the St. Tammany Parish Training School for Negros, where each day she walked to school as she was unable to ride a school bus with her [[Page S2622]] White schoolmates. Soon after completing her middle-school education, Ms. Laurant selflessly began working full time in an effort to ease her family's financial hardships. In 1946, Ms. Laurant met her future husband, Norvell Laurant, in her hometown of Bonfouca. After marrying, the couple left Louisiana for Columbus, OH, where Mr. Laurant was stationed in the U.S. Army and Air Force. After receiving an honorable discharge from the military in 1948, the two moved back to Bonfouca. There, they built their home and raised seven children, to whom they stressed the importance of strong Christian values and a well-rounded education. Leading by example, Ms. Laurant attended adult evening classes at St. Tammany High School. During this time she also worked as a housekeeper to provide for her family. Using her past experiences, Ms. Laurant advocated for racial integration in schools throughout Salmen and Slidell, LA, to ensure that African-American students were treated fairly and received a quality education. Ms. Laurant still resides in Bofouca, now an incorporated part of Slidell, where after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, she rebuilt the home in which she raised all seven of her children. As she approaches her 90th birthday, I would like to honor Ms. Laurant's life, her accomplishments, and her commitment to her community and advancing the rights of African Americans during a tumultuous time in our Nation's history. I wish her the happiest of birthdays. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2621-S2622] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MARGARET N.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of Delegates of the State of West Virginia urging the United States Congress to provide funding for the West Virginia National Guard to sustain and enhance its capabilities in its role in a regional catastrophe and to modernize the antiquated avionics of its fleet of C130s and other aircraft to meet global airspace requirements for 2020; to the Committee on Armed Services. House Concurrent Resolution No. 20 Whereas, In the event of a regional catastrophe, West Virginia's east-west highways, including I-68 and I-64 are links to the major exit corridors from the FEMA National Capital Region (NCR) westward and, assuming that a regional catastrophe will likely include Baltimore to the north of the NCR and Richmond to the south of the NCR, westward evacuation utilizing these highways is highly likely and is, in fact anticipated; and Whereas, The routes through West Virginia will traverse rural areas that do not have infrastructure adequate for what could be a mass of evacuees in the worst-case scenario; experience in regional emergencies, such as Superstorm Sandy in 2012, illustrates some shortcomings in planning that is less focused on regions and more on states; and Whereas, West Virginia is perfectly (and geographically) postured to support any emergency or disaster response to the NCR, including mass evacuation westward; and Whereas, FEMA regions do not necessarily represent grouping of states likely to be involved in some scenarios; FEMA region III contains the NCR and West Virginia as its western- most edge and in a major catastrophe, Regions V, with Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, VII with Missouri, and IV with Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina are likely to be involved in some combinations; and Whereas, The National Guard, through the use of Emergency Management Assistance Compacts, can operate across state lines to provide vital response capability in security, transportation, medical, housing, communications, command and control, and others based on its dual role in military preparedness and state civil support; and Whereas, Military Force Structure assigned to the National Guard must be considered by Federal Military planners for the dual use they can encounter; National Guard Organizations require personnel, equipment, organization, training, leadership and funding to maintain federal military standards and to be prepared to respond to a domestic emergency or disaster; and Whereas, Regional catastrophic planning is dependent on National Guard assets, capabilities and responsiveness; consequently, it is also critical that federal military planners assess the impact of their force structure changes on regional capability needs as well as those that are state specific; and Whereas, The C-130 H3 ``Hercules'' aircraft assigned to the 130th Airlift Wing of the West Virginia National Guard at Yeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia will eventually become obsolete without system modernization to the communication, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) components; National Air Traffic Control (ATC) agencies and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are moddernizing airspace faster than the U.S. Air Force is updating C-130 avionics capabilities; and Whereas, Aircraft component acquisition becomes increasingly difficult as fewer C-130 H aircraft remain in the Air Force inventory and the unique components of the C- 130, including its self contained navigational system (SCNS), face short term supply chain shortages that could be remedied with aircraft avionics modernization; and Whereas, The contract to perform maintenance on aircraft flight computers is renewed annually and this perpetual reliance on short term contracts increases sustainment cost and challenges mission effectiveness and operational planning; and Whereas, Reliance on short term contracts and antiquated avionics will increase Air Force expense in the long run as it translates to more expensive mission-essential [[Page S2625]] contracts and increased fuel expenditures due to inefficient routing: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia; That the Legislature hereby urges the United States Congress to provide funding for the West Virginia National Guard to sustain and enhance its capabilities in its role in a regional catastrophe and to modernize the antiquated avionics of its fleet of C-130s and other aircraft to meet global airspace requirements for 2020; and be it further Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates is hereby directed to forward a copy of this resolution to the President and Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the House of Representatives and to the members of West Virginia congressional delegation. ____ POM-162. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of Delegates of the State of West Virginia urging the United States Environmental Protection Agency not to prohibit conversion of vehicles to race cars; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. House Concurrent Resolution No. 68 Whereas, The United States Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a regulation to prohibit conversion of vehicles originally designed for on-road use into racecars; and Whereas, The regulation would also make the sale of certain products for use on such vehicles illegal. The proposed regulation was contained within a nonrelated proposed regulation entitled ``Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium-and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles--Phase 2''; and Whereas, The regulation would impact all vehicle types, including the sports cars, sedans and hatch-backs commonly converted strictly for use at the track. While the Clean Air Act prohibits certain modifications to motor vehicles, it is clear that vehicles built or modified for racing, and not used on the streets, are not the ``motor vehicles'' that Congress intended to regulate; and Whereas, ``This proposed regulation represents overreaching by the agency, runs contrary to the law and defies decades of racing activity where EPA has acknowledged and allowed conversion of vehicles,'' said Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) President and CEO Chris Kersting. ``Congress did not intend the original Clean Air Act to extend to vehicles modified for racing and has reenforced that intent on more than one occasion''; and Whereas, SEMA submitted comments in opposition to the regulation and met with the United States Environmental Protection Agency to confirm the agency's intentions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency indicated that the regulation would prohibit conversion of vehicles into racecars and make the sale of certain emissions-related parts for use on converted vehicles illegal. This would certainly be detrimental to the economy: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia; That the State of West Virginia hereby respectfully urges the Environmental Protection Agency not to prohibit conversion of vehicles to race cars; and be it further Resolved, That the State of West Virginia respectfully urges the Environmental Protection Agency not to issue its final regulations until the legislatures of the states have submitted comments; and be it further Resolved, That the State of West Virginia forward official copies of the resolution to the President of the United States, to the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress and West Virginia's representatives in Congress. ____ POM-163.

This would certainly be detrimental to the economy: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia; That the State of West Virginia hereby respectfully urges the Environmental Protection Agency not to prohibit conversion of vehicles to race cars; and be it further Resolved, That the State of West Virginia respectfully urges the Environmental Protection Agency not to issue its final regulations until the legislatures of the states have submitted comments; and be it further Resolved, That the State of West Virginia forward official copies of the resolution to the President of the United States, to the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress and West Virginia's representatives in Congress. ____ POM-163. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Nebraska relative to their ratification of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Legislative Resolution 381 Whereas, The first Congress of the United States, at its first session, held in New York, New York, on the twenty- fifth day of September, in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, passed the following resolution to amend the Constitution of the United States of America, in the following words and figures in part, to wit: The Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution; Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, two thirds of both Houses concurring, That the following Articles be proposed to the Legislatures of the several States, as Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, all or any of which Articles, when ratified by three fourths of the said Legislatures, to be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of the said Constitution, viz.: No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Members of the One Hundred Fourth Legislature of Nebraska, Second Session: 1. That such proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States be ratified. 2. That the Clerk of the Legislature send copies of this resolution to the Administrator of the General Services Administration, the President of the United States Senate, and the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. ____ POM-164.

to the committee on armed services. house concurrent resolution no. 20 whereas, in the event of a regional catastrophe, west virginia's east-west highways, including i-68 and i-64 are links to the major exit corridors from the fema national capital region (ncr) westward and, assuming that a regional catastrophe will likely include baltimore to the north of the ncr and richmond to the south of the ncr, westward evacuation utilizing these highways is highly likely and is, in fact anticipated; and whereas, the routes through west virginia will traverse rural areas that do not have infrastructure adequate for what could be a mass of evacuees in the worst-case scenario; experience in regional emergencies, such as superstorm sandy in 2012, illustrates some shortcomings in planning that is less focused on regions and more on states; and whereas, west virginia is perfectly (and geographically) postured to support any emergency or disaster response to the ncr, including mass evacuation westward; and whereas, fema regions do not necessarily represent grouping of states likely to be involved in some scenarios; fema region iii contains the ncr and west virginia as its western- most edge and in a major catastrophe, regions v, with ohio, indiana, and illinois, vii with missouri, and iv with kentucky, tennessee, and north carolina are likely to be involved in some combinations; and whereas, the national guard, through the use of emergency management assistance compacts, can operate across state lines to provide vital response capability in security, transportation, medical, housing, communications, command and control, and others based on its dual role in military preparedness and state civil support; and whereas, military force structure assigned to the national guard must be considered by federal military planners for the dual use they can encounter; national guard organizations require personnel, equipment, organization, training, leadership and funding to maintain federal military standards and to be prepared to respond to a domestic emergency or disaster; and whereas, regional catastrophic planning is dependent on national guard assets, capabilities and responsiveness; consequently, it is also critical that federal military planners assess the impact of their force structure changes on regional capability needs as well as those that are state specific; and whereas, the c-130 h3 ``hercules'' aircraft assigned to the 130th airlift wing of the west virginia national guard at yeager airport in charleston, west virginia will eventually become obsolete without system modernization to the communication, navigation, and surveillance (cns) components; national air traffic control (atc) agencies and the international civil aviation organization (icao) are moddernizing airspace faster than the u.s. air force is updating c-130 avionics capabilities; and whereas, aircraft component acquisition becomes increasingly difficult as fewer c-130 h aircraft remain in the air force inventory and the unique components of the c- 130, including its self contained navigational system (scns), face short term supply chain shortages that could be remedied with aircraft avionics modernization; and whereas, the contract to perform maintenance on aircraft flight computers is renewed annually and this perpetual reliance on short term contracts increases sustainment cost and challenges mission effectiveness and operational planning; and whereas, reliance on short term contracts and antiquated avionics will increase air force expense in the long run as it translates to more expensive mission-essential [[page s2625]] contracts and increased fuel expenditures due to inefficient routing: now, therefore, be it resolved by the legislature of west virginia; that the legislature hereby urges the united states congress to provide funding for the west virginia national guard to sustain and enhance its capabilities in its role in a regional catastrophe and to modernize the antiquated avionics of its fleet of c-130s and other aircraft to meet global airspace requirements for 2020; and be it further resolved, that the clerk of the house of delegates is hereby directed to forward a copy of this resolution to the president and secretary of the united states senate, the speaker and clerk of the house of representatives and to the members of west virginia congressional delegation. ____ pom-162. a concurrent resolution adopted by the house of delegates of the state of west virginia urging the united states environmental protection agency not to prohibit conversion of vehicles to race cars; to the committee on environment and public works. house concurrent resolution no. 68 whereas, the united states environmental protection agency has proposed a regulation to prohibit conversion of vehicles originally designed for on-road use into racecars; and whereas, the regulation would also make the sale of certain products for use on such vehicles illegal. the proposed regulation was contained within a nonrelated proposed regulation entitled ``greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency standards for medium-and heavy-duty engines and vehicles--phase 2''; and whereas, the regulation would impact all vehicle types, including the sports cars, sedans and hatch-backs commonly converted strictly for use at the track. while the clean air act prohibits certain modifications to motor vehicles, it is clear that vehicles built or modified for racing, and not used on the streets, are not the ``motor vehicles'' that congress intended to regulate; and whereas, ``this proposed regulation represents overreaching by the agency, runs contrary to the law and defies decades of racing activity where epa has acknowledged and allowed conversion of vehicles,'' said specialty equipment market association (sema) president and ceo chris kersting. ``congress did not intend the original clean air act to extend to vehicles modified for racing and has reenforced that intent on more than one occasion'';

A bill to award a Congressional Gold Medal to former United States Senator Max Cleland; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 2903 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Max Cleland Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Joseph Maxwell ``Max'' Cleland has demonstrated the highest degree of professionalism and has served as an inspiration to friends, family, veterans, and many others while dedicating his life to the public service of the United States. (2) Max Cleland began his career in public service when he joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps as a young college student, went on active duty in the United States Army (in this section referred to as the ``Army'') in 1965 as a Second Lieutenant, and volunteered for service in Vietnam, rising to the rank of Captain. (3) The Army recognized Max Cleland with a Silver Star for his gallantry in action during the Battle of Khe Sanh in April of 1968. According to the letter of commendation from the Army, ``The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 8, 1918 (amended by act of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain (Signal Corps) Joseph Maxwell Cleland, United States Army, for gallantry in action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam.''. (4) Max Cleland, a Battalion Signal Officer dispatched to set up a radio relay antenna, was severely wounded on the battlefield and, as a result, lost both of his legs and his right arm. Cleland would endure 18 months of extremely difficult rehabilitation and recovery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and hospitals of the Department of Veterans Affairs (in this section referred to as ``VA hospitals'') in Washington, DC. In 1969, Cleland testified before the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate on the hardships faced by veterans returning home from war. (5) Upon returning to Georgia, Max Cleland was determined to continue his public service and, in 1970, at the age of 28, was elected as the youngest Georgia State senator and helped pass legislation to make public facilities accessible for veterans, older people, and individuals with disabilities. (6) Max Cleland later came to Washington, DC and joined the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs as a professional staff member, investigating VA hospitals across the country and the treatment of service members returning from Vietnam. (7) In 1977, President Jimmy Carter named Max Cleland, then just 34 years old, the youngest ever individual, and first Vietnam veteran, to serve as Administrator of the Veterans Administration. As Administrator, Cleland helped create the ``Vet Center'' counseling program, which later expanded to 300 facilities nationwide helping veterans and their families receive psychological care for post-traumatic stress disorders and other problems associated with warfare. (8) Following his term as Administrator of the Veterans Administration, Max Cleland returned to elective office in 1982 when he was elected as Secretary of State of the State of Georgia. As Secretary of State, Cleland implemented the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20501 et seq.) in Georgia and added almost 1,000,000 new voters to the rolls. (9) Max Cleland was elected to the United States Senate in 1996 and would go on to chair the Subcommittee on Personnel of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate. In the Senate, Cleland was known for his work in expanding benefits for service members and in improving veterans' health care, education, and the environment. (10) After his service in the Senate, Max Cleland continued his distinguished career in public service by becoming a commissioner on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly referred to as the ``9/11 Commission'') and later as a member of the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. (11) In 2009, President Barack Obama named Max Cleland Secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission. As Secretary of the Commission, Cleland is charged with commemorating both the permanent cemeteries of the United States located in foreign countries and the military memorials, monuments, and markers demonstrating where members of the United States Armed Forces have served overseas since World War I. (12) In 2010, President Obama again called on Max Cleland to serve his country and Cleland again accepted. This time, Cleland agreed to serve as co-chair, and eventually [[Page S2629]] the inaugural chair, of the Advisory Committee on Arlington National Cemetery, which was established to help fix the problems facing the final resting place for many of the heroes of the United States. After his tenure as chair, Cleland was awarded the Decoration for Distinguished Civilian Service of the Army, the highest honorary award that the Secretary of the Army can confer on a civilian. (13) After overcoming some of the most difficult challenges imaginable, Max Cleland has spent almost five decades of his life in service to the United States and the country is forever indebted to his service. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

A bill to award a Congressional Gold Medal to former United States Senator Max Cleland; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 2903 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Max Cleland Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Joseph Maxwell ``Max'' Cleland has demonstrated the highest degree of professionalism and has served as an inspiration to friends, family, veterans, and many others while dedicating his life to the public service of the United States. (2) Max Cleland began his career in public service when he joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps as a young college student, went on active duty in the United States Army (in this section referred to as the ``Army'') in 1965 as a Second Lieutenant, and volunteered for service in Vietnam, rising to the rank of Captain. (3) The Army recognized Max Cleland with a Silver Star for his gallantry in action during the Battle of Khe Sanh in April of 1968. According to the letter of commendation from the Army, ``The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 8, 1918 (amended by act of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Captain (Signal Corps) Joseph Maxwell Cleland, United States Army, for gallantry in action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam.''. (4) Max Cleland, a Battalion Signal Officer dispatched to set up a radio relay antenna, was severely wounded on the battlefield and, as a result, lost both of his legs and his right arm. Cleland would endure 18 months of extremely difficult rehabilitation and recovery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and hospitals of the Department of Veterans Affairs (in this section referred to as ``VA hospitals'') in Washington, DC. In 1969, Cleland testified before the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate on the hardships faced by veterans returning home from war. (5) Upon returning to Georgia, Max Cleland was determined to continue his public service and, in 1970, at the age of 28, was elected as the youngest Georgia State senator and helped pass legislation to make public facilities accessible for veterans, older people, and individuals with disabilities. (6) Max Cleland later came to Washington, DC and joined the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs as a professional staff member, investigating VA hospitals across the country and the treatment of service members returning from Vietnam. (7) In 1977, President Jimmy Carter named Max Cleland, then just 34 years old, the youngest ever individual, and first Vietnam veteran, to serve as Administrator of the Veterans Administration. As Administrator, Cleland helped create the ``Vet Center'' counseling program, which later expanded to 300 facilities nationwide helping veterans and their families receive psychological care for post-traumatic stress disorders and other problems associated with warfare. (8) Following his term as Administrator of the Veterans Administration, Max Cleland returned to elective office in 1982 when he was elected as Secretary of State of the State of Georgia. As Secretary of State, Cleland implemented the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20501 et seq.) in Georgia and added almost 1,000,000 new voters to the rolls. (9) Max Cleland was elected to the United States Senate in 1996 and would go on to chair the Subcommittee on Personnel of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate. In the Senate, Cleland was known for his work in expanding benefits for service members and in improving veterans' health care, education, and the environment. (10) After his service in the Senate, Max Cleland continued his distinguished career in public service by becoming a commissioner on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly referred to as the ``9/11 Commission'') and later as a member of the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. (11) In 2009, President Barack Obama named Max Cleland Secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission. As Secretary of the Commission, Cleland is charged with commemorating both the permanent cemeteries of the United States located in foreign countries and the military memorials, monuments, and markers demonstrating where members of the United States Armed Forces have served overseas since World War I. (12) In 2010, President Obama again called on Max Cleland to serve his country and Cleland again accepted. This time, Cleland agreed to serve as co-chair, and eventually [[Page S2629]] the inaugural chair, of the Advisory Committee on Arlington National Cemetery, which was established to help fix the problems facing the final resting place for many of the heroes of the United States. After his tenure as chair, Cleland was awarded the Decoration for Distinguished Civilian Service of the Army, the highest honorary award that the Secretary of the Army can confer on a civilian. (13) After overcoming some of the most difficult challenges imaginable, Max Cleland has spent almost five decades of his life in service to the United States and the country is forever indebted to his service.

CREC-2016-05-09-pt1-PgS2648,CREC-2016-05-09,114,REMEMBERING CONRAD BURNS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2648] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING CONRAD BURNS Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, last week the world and the Burns family lost Senator Conrad Burns. There are thousands of reasons to celebrate the life of Senator Conrad Burns, but I will only mention a few, while I hope others write down their memories to help fill the void. He made friends instantly and could quickly find a way to relate to anyone. He had a story for every situation. That is the most effective way to make a point. I particularly enjoyed his marital advice, which he learned in Hudson, WY. His stories always had a location and a person. He said Hudson is where he spent a week one day--but it is where he bet a friend $100 that his wife Phyllis could beat his friend's wife in a foot race. He wasn't able to talk Phyllis into racing, but fortunately, the friend must not have had any luck with his wife, either, as he didn't show up. While Conrad was a consummate, effective Senator, his love for his faith, his family, and friends made him special. He was a man who lived by example. He was willing to share about his life to help with our lives. He mentored me and many others with his plain speaking, and timely, sort of abrupt suggestions. He didn't waste time or words, but he always had time to help. He also probably never realized the difference he made. I know he never realized the difference he made daily while he worked on legislation, much of which he never got credit for but was effective at getting finished. He had a special talent for speaking and presenting that always got people's attention. For example, he was able to take difficult issues involving telecommunications and make them understandable to his colleagues and hold their interest. That is an unmatched talent. He had a unique ability to sell ideas that came from his vast, real-life experience in agriculture, radio, and especially in auctioneering. He could get you to buy into his idea, and you didn't even realize that you had bid. His experience in small business gave him the ability to make people understand the kinds of decisions small businesses have to make--how many decisions, how far in advance they had to be made, and how critical that was to how well the United States does. His staff would occasionally suggest other words or phrases he might use after the fact. He recognized and made a case for the importance of small business as the engine of our economy. Golf gave him an outlet for his frustration and provided relaxation and an opportunity for less stressful conversations. I am not a golfer, but Conrad always made the experience enjoyable and memorable. His ability to sell is best noted when he auctioned a special Kenai handmade quilt and got $15,000 when the best ever previous price was $3,000. Incidentally, he made the $3,000 quilt sale too. By now, Conrad has had a chance to have a heart-to-heart talk--that is the only kind of talk you could have with Conrad, and especially in Heaven--with his daughter Kate, who passed away several years ago. I picture him playing golf in Heaven, where he is learning firsthand that some of those stories about clergy playing golf are true. I bet he even has a use for a saddle again and is still keeping up on the ag futures. Conrad, you have been missed and will be missed as your memory reminds and inspires us. Your family is in our prayers as we grieve and celebrate your life along with them. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2648] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING CONRAD BURNS Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, last week the world and the Burns family lost Senator Conrad Burns. There are thousands of reasons to celebrate the life of Senator Conrad Burns, but I will only mention a few, while I hope others write down their memories to help fill the void. He made friends instantly and could quickly find a way to relate to anyone. He had a story for every situation. That is the most effective way to make a point. I particularly enjoyed his marital advice, which he learned in Hudson, WY. His stories always had a location and a person. He said Hudson is where he spent a week one day--but it is where he bet a friend $100 that his wife Phyllis could beat his friend's wife in a foot race. He wasn't able to talk Phyllis into racing, but fortunately, the friend must not have had any luck with his wife, either, as he didn't show up. While Conrad was a consummate, effective Senator, his love for his faith, his family, and friends made him special. He was a man who lived by example. He was willing to share about his life to help with our lives. He mentored me and many others with his plain speaking, and timely, sort of abrupt suggestions. He didn't waste time or words, but he always had time to help. He also probably never realized the difference he made. I know he never realized the difference he made daily while he worked on legislation, much of which he never got credit for but was effective at getting finished. He had a special talent for speaking and presenting that always got people's attention. For example, he was able to take difficult issues involving telecommunications and make them understandable to his colleagues and hold their interest. That is an unmatched talent. He had a unique ability to sell ideas that came from his vast, real-life experience in agriculture, radio, and especially in auctioneering. He could get you to buy into his idea, and you didn't even realize that you had bid. His experience in small business gave him the ability to make people understand the kinds of decisions small businesses have to make--how many decisions, how far in advance they had to be made, and how critical that was to how well the United States does. His staff would occasionally suggest other words or phrases he might use after the fact. He recognized and made a case for the importance of small business as the engine of our economy. Golf gave him an outlet for his frustration and provided relaxation and an opportunity for less stressful conversations. I am not a golfer, but Conrad always made the experience enjoyable and memorable. His ability to sell is best noted when he auctioned a special Kenai handmade quilt and got $15,000 when the best ever previous price was $3,000. Incidentally, he made the $3,000 quilt sale too. By now, Conrad has had a chance to have a heart-to-heart talk--that is the only kind of talk you could have with Conrad, and especially in Heaven--with his daughter Kate, who passed away several years ago. I picture him playing golf in Heaven, where he is learning firsthand that some of those stories about clergy playing golf are true. I bet he even has a use for a saddle again and is still keeping up on the ag futures. Conrad, you have been missed and will be missed as your memory reminds and inspires us. Your family is in our prayers as we grieve and celebrate your life along with them. ____________________",package_114_174.csv,3599,3599,3663,"[congressional record volume 162, number 72 (monday, may 9, 2016)] [senate] [page s2648] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] remembering conrad burns mr. enzi. mr. president, last week the world and the burns family lost senator conrad burns. there are thousands of reasons to celebrate the life of senator conrad burns, but i will only mention a few, while i hope others write down their memories to help fill the void. he made friends instantly and could quickly find a way to relate to anyone. he had a story for every situation. that is the most effective way to make a point. i particularly enjoyed his marital advice, which he learned in hudson, wy. his stories always had a location and a person. he said hudson is where he spent a week one day--but it is where he bet a friend $100 that his wife phyllis could beat his friend's wife in a foot race. he wasn't able to talk phyllis into racing, but fortunately, the friend must not have had any luck with his wife, either, as he didn't show up. while conrad was a consummate, effective senator, his love for his faith, his family, and friends made him special. he was a man who lived by example. he was willing to share about his life to help with our lives. he mentored me and many others with his plain speaking, and timely, sort of abrupt suggestions. he didn't waste time or words, but he always had time to help. he also probably never realized the difference he made. i know he never realized the difference he made daily while he worked on legislation, much of which he never got credit for but was effective at getting finished. he had a special talent for speaking and presenting that always got people's attention. for example, he was able to take difficult issues involving telecommunications and make them understandable to his colleagues and hold their interest. that is an unmatched talent. he had a unique ability to sell ideas that came from his vast, real-life experience in agriculture, radio, and especially in auctioneering. he could get you to buy into his idea, and you didn't even realize that you had bid. his experience in small business gave him the ability to make people understand the kinds of decisions small businesses have to make--how many decisions, how far in advance they had to be made, and how critical that was to how well the united states does. his staff would occasionally suggest other words or phrases he might use after the fact. he recognized and made a case for the importance of small business as the engine of our economy. golf gave him an outlet for his frustration and provided relaxation and an opportunity for less stressful conversations. i am not a golfer, but conrad always made the experience enjoyable and memorable. his ability to sell is best noted when he auctioned a special kenai handmade quilt and got $15,000 when the best ever previous price was $3,000. incidentally, he made the $3,000 quilt sale too. by now, conrad has had a chance to have a heart-to-heart talk--that is the only kind of talk you could have with conrad, and especially in heaven--with his daughter kate, who passed away several years ago. i picture him playing golf in heaven, where he is learning firsthand that some of those stories about clergy playing golf are true. i bet he even has a use for a saddle again and is still keeping up on the ag futures. conrad, you have been missed and will be missed as your memory reminds and inspires us. your family is in our prayers as we grieve and celebrate your life along with them. ____________________",3599
CREC-2016-05-09-pt1-PgS2645-5,CREC-2016-05-09,114,ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2645-S2646] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to make brief comments concerning the status of the Energy and Water appropriations bill, following the actions of the majority leader. I said most of what I had to say earlier. Here is my view of it. Tonight, and for the third time, the Senate voted not to end debate on the Energy and Water appropriations bill, even though we have virtually finished all of our work on it. We have one difference of opinion, and it is a big one. It is provocative. It is the Cotton amendment that would prohibit U.S. tax dollars being used next year to purchase heavy water from Iran. The majority leader has filed cloture on the Cotton amendment, which means that after tomorrow--the intervening day--we will have a vote on the Cotton amendment on Wednesday. We will dispense with it the way we usually dispense with issues about which we have large differences of opinion: We vote on them. Sometimes we can work them out, sometimes we can withdraw them, and sometimes we can't. So we are going to vote on it. Senator Cotton has said that if he should not win the amendment, he will withdraw it. That will dispose of the Cotton amendment, and then we can move on and finish the Energy and Water appropriations bill. I said earlier today, and I will reiterate, that while I have defended Senator Cotton's right to offer his amendment--it is germane and it is relevant--I will vote no on his amendment for two reasons. One reason is I believe it raises the possibility that if the United States is not allowed to buy heavy water from Iran, then it puts it on the international market and it could be purchased by other countries, such as North Korea, for use in making nuclear weapons. This is not a vote for or against the Iran nuclear agreement. I am opposed to that agreement. This is a question about what to do about the heavy water that Iran has, which it has to get rid of, which can be used either for peaceful purposes, which we use it for in the United States when we have it--we use it for the neutron microscope at the Oak Ridge Laboratory, we use it for fiber optics, we use it for MRI imaging, we use it in a variety of ways--or it can be used to make plutonium and nuclear weapons. Now is not the time to be increasing the possibility that heavy water from Iran could be put on the international market and sold to a country such as North Korea, which might use it to make nuclear weapons. That is No. 1. No. 2, while the amendment is relevant and germane, this is an amendment that ought to be considered first in the Foreign Relations Committee or the Armed Services Committee. I get a lot of lectures sometimes in our Republican lunches about appropriators making decisions that ought to be in the authorizing committee. Well, this is one of them. If there were an issue that raises more such complex national security issues, it would be hard to think of one. Might this heavy water be used by a country to make nuclear weapons or, on the other hand, if we purchase it, does it create a market or an incentive for Iran to produce more heavy water? What happens to India, which produces heavy water? What happens to Argentina? What happens to the need of the United States for heavy water, since we don't produce it at all, yet we need it? Iran produces it. We don't want them to have it. We don't produce it. We need it. We don't want North Korea to have it. These are complex national security issues that ought not to be decided on an amendment to this bill. I will be voting no on the Cotton amendment because of the fear that it might create the possibility that putting it on the international market would put this distilled water, which could be used peacefully, in the hands of those who might make a bomb with it, and because I think an appropriate way to handle it is to first allow the Foreign Relations Committee or the Armed Services Committee to deal with it. This is a sincere amendment. I have defended the right of the Senator from Arkansas to offer his amendment. My friends on the other side don't like the amendment. They see it as provocative. They see it as a poison pill. That is a difference we will just have to work out over time. This is the U.S. Senate. The right way to work out differences we can't otherwise work out is simply to vote. The majority leader has made sure we will have a vote on the Cotton amendment by Wednesday. My hope is that as important as this Energy and Water appropriations bill is, that Senator Feinstein and I could work with the Democratic leader and [[Page S2646]] the Republican leader and others to see if we might not agree tomorrow on a way to vote on the Cotton amendment and finish the bill. As I have said earlier, 80 different Senators have important provisions in the bill. I know that. I know they are important because many of my colleagues went home over the last week and took credit for passing them, even though we have a little more work to do. So while we have one difference of opinion left--and it is a big one--I think the majority leader has put us on a path to come to resolution by Wednesday, and I hope by tomorrow. Let me conclude by thanking Senator Feinstein. She feels as passionately about this as Senator Cotton does. Maybe she feels more passionately about it. I respect and understand that, but I also respect the fact that she and I are bringing the first appropriations bill to the floor, and it is our basic constitutional duty to do so. We haven't had an Energy and Water appropriations bill make it all the way across the floor under regular order since 2009. That is not the way the railroad is supposed to run around here. We need to show the American people that we can resolve our differences and come to a result, so we will do that. We will have a vote, and then we will finish the bill. I hope we can do it tomorrow. I look forward to continuing my discussions with the Senator from California and other interested Senators to get it resolved. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for his views and for his very instructive actions to move this bill to fruition. I know we both think it is an important bill. We know the subject that Senator Cotton has raised is also important. I think there has been a good discussion on it and understanding of the pros and cons, so I think now we can wait until Wednesday, an hour after we come in, for the vote, and we will see what the will of the Senate is. I want the chairman to know I am very grateful for the actions he has taken because this is enabling us to pass the bill and see it enacted into law, we hope. So thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2645-S2646] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL Mr. ALEXANDER.

what happens to india, which produces heavy water? what happens to argentina? what happens to the need of the united states for heavy water, since we don't produce it at all, yet we need it? iran produces it. we don't want them to have it. we don't produce it. we need it. we don't want north korea to have it. these are complex national security issues that ought not to be decided on an amendment to this bill. i will be voting no on the cotton amendment because of the fear that it might create the possibility that putting it on the international market would put this distilled water, which could be used peacefully, in the hands of those who might make a bomb with it, and because i think an appropriate way to handle it is to first allow the foreign relations committee or the armed services committee to deal with it. this is a sincere amendment. i have defended the right of the senator from arkansas to offer his amendment. my friends on the other side don't like the amendment. they see it as provocative. they see it as a poison pill. that is a difference we will just have to work out over time. this is the u.s. senate. the right way to work out differences we can't otherwise work out is simply to vote. the majority leader has made sure we will have a vote on the cotton amendment by wednesday. my hope is that as important as this energy and water appropriations bill is, that senator feinstein and i could work with the democratic leader and [[page s2646]] the republican leader and others to see if we might not agree tomorrow on a way to vote on the cotton amendment and finish the bill. as i have said earlier, 80 different senators have important provisions in the bill. i know that. i know they are important because many of my colleagues went home over the last week and took credit for passing them, even though we have a little more work to do. so while we have one difference of opinion left--and it is a big one--i think the majority leader has put us on a path to come to resolution by wednesday, and i hope by tomorrow. let me conclude by thanking senator feinstein. she feels as passionately about this as senator cotton does. maybe she feels more passionately about it. i respect and understand that, but i also respect the fact that she and i are bringing the first appropriations bill to the floor, and it is our basic constitutional duty to do so. we haven't had an energy and water appropriations bill make it all the way across the floor under regular order since 2009. that is not the way the railroad is supposed to run around here. we need to show the american people that we can resolve our differences and come to a result, so we will do that. we will have a vote, and then we will finish the bill. i hope we can do it tomorrow. i look forward to continuing my discussions with the senator from california and other interested senators to get it resolved. i thank the presiding officer, and i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from california. mrs. feinstein. mr. president, i rise to thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for his views and for his very instructive actions to move this bill to fruition. i know we both think it is an important bill. we know the subject that senator cotton has raised is also important. i think there has been a good discussion on it and understanding of the pros and cons, so i think now we can wait until wednesday, an hour after we come in, for the vote, and we will see what the will of the senate is. i want the chairman to know i am very grateful for the actions he has taken because this is enabling us to pass the bill and see it enacted into law, we hope. so thank you very much, mr. president. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from connecticut. ____________________",7139
CREC-2016-05-09-pt1-PgS2646,CREC-2016-05-09,114,GUN VIOLENCE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2646-S2648] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN VIOLENCE Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, during our break, last Thursday the New York Times ran a story that was as heartrending and gut-wrenching as I have read in a long time. The headline was: ``One Week in April, Four Toddlers Shot and Killed Themselves.'' I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the New York Times, May 5, 2016] One Week in April, Four Toddlers Shot and Killed Themselves (By Jack Healy, Julie Bosman, Alan Blinder, and Julie Turkewitz) Kansas City, Mo.--Sha'Quille Kornegay, 2 years old, was buried in a pink coffin, her favorite doll by her side and a tiara strategically placed to hide the self-inflicted gunshot wound to her forehead. She had been napping in bed with her father, Courtenay Block, late last month when she discovered the 9-millimeter handgun he often kept under his pillow in his Kansas City, Mo., home. It was equipped with a laser sight that lit up like the red lights on her cousins' sneakers. Mr. Block told the police he woke to see Sha'Quille by his bed, bleeding and crying, the gun at her feet. A bullet had pierced her skull. In a country with more than 30,000 annual gun deaths, the smallest fingers on the trigger belong to children like Sha'Quille. During a single week in April, four toddlers--Holston, Kiyan, Za'veon and Sha'Quille--shot and killed themselves, and a mother driving through Milwaukee was killed after her 2-year-old apparently picked up a gun that had slid out from under the driver's seat. It was a brutal stretch, even by the standards of researchers who track these shootings. These are shooters who need help tying their shoelaces, too young sometimes to even say the word ``gun,'' killed by their own curiosity. They accidentally fire a parent's pistol while playing cops and robbers, while riding in a shopping cart, after finding it in the pocket of the coat their father forgot to wear to work. The gun that killed Sha'Quille last Thursday was pointing up, as if being inspected, when it fired. They are the most maddening gun deaths in America. Last year, at least 30 people were killed in accidental shootings in which the shooter was 5 or younger, according to Everytown For Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group that tracks these shootings, largely through news reports. With shootings by preschoolers happening at a pace of about two per week, some of the victims were the youngsters' parents or siblings, but in many cases the children ended up taking their own lives. ``You can't call this a tragic accident,'' said Jean Peters Baker, the prosecutor of Jackson County, Mo., who is overseeing the criminal case in Sha'Quille's death. Her office charged Mr. Block, 24, with second-degree murder and child endangerment. ``These are really preventable, and we're not willing to prevent them.'' Gun control advocates say these deaths illustrate lethal gaps in gun safety laws. Some states require locked storage of guns or trigger locks to be sold with handguns. Others leave safety decisions largely to gun owners. Twenty-seven states have laws that hold adults responsible for letting children have unsupervised access to guns, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, though experts say such measures have, at best, a small effect on reducing gun deaths. Massachusetts is the only state that requires gun owners to store their guns in a locked place, though it has not stopped youngsters there from accidentally killing themselves or other children. Gun rights groups have long opposed these kinds of laws. They argue that trigger locks can fail, that mandatory storage can put a gun out of reach in an emergency, and that such measures infringe on Second Amendment rights. ``It's clearly a tragedy, but it's not something that's widespread,'' said Larry Pratt, a spokesman and former executive director of Gun Owners of America. ``To base public policy on occasional mishaps would be a grave mistake.'' In Kansas City, Sha'Quille's family is trying to come to grips with her death and the murder charge facing Mr. Block. In interviews, several relatives said they did not believe he deserved to be convicted of felony murder, but some questioned his judgment in leaving a loaded gun out while he slept as well as his actions after he discovered that his daughter was grievously wounded. According to court records, Mr. Block told the police that immediately after the shooting, he went to the bathroom, wrapped the gun in a shirt and put it into a vent in the floor. He then ran outside carrying his dying daughter and yelled for a neighbor to call for help. He was also charged with evidence tampering. Sha'Quille's mother, Montorre Kornegay, said that she had recently separated from Mr. Block after more than five years together, but that they remained close. She said he loved the girl, whose first word was ``Daddy.'' When he called Ms. Kornegay from jail, he told her he was sorry and talked about how much he missed Sha'Quille. The girl was just 2, but wanted to be older, telling people she was already 5. She would run through the house, playing her own private game of peekaboo, relatives said. In a cacophony of squeaky children at home, relatives could always distinguish Sha'Quille's low, raspier voice. One day, she'll be a singer, they told one another. ``What happened was wrong,'' Ms. Kornegay said. She said that she did not think Mr. Block deserved to face a murder charge, but that he had behaved irresponsibly. ``Why didn't you stay up and watch her?'' Parents, police officers and neighbors from Georgia to California are asking similar painful questions this week. Here are some of their stories. `Stay With Me' In 2015, there were at least 278 unintentional shootings at the hands of young children and teenagers, according to Everytown's database. During the week in April when Sha'Quille and the other children died, there were at least five other accidental shootings by children and teenagers. Alysee Defee, 13, was shot in the armpit with a 20-gauge shotgun she had used for turkey hunting in Floyd County, Ind. Zai Deshields, 4, pulled a handgun out of a backpack at her grandmother's home in Arlington, Tex., and shot her uncle in the leg. A child who accidentally pulls the trigger is most likely to be 3 years old, the statistics show. Holston Cole was 3, a boy crackling with energy who would wake before dawn, his pastor said. He loved singing ``Jesus Loves Me'' and bouncing inside the inflatable castle in his family's front yard in Dallas, Ga. About 7 a.m. on April 26, he found a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol in his father's backpack, according to investigators. The gun fired, and Holston's panicked father, David, called 911. Even before a dispatcher could speak, Mr. Cole wailed ``No, no!'' into the phone, according to a redacted recording. Mr. Cole pleaded for his 3-year-old son to hold on until the ambulance could arrive: ``Stay with me, Holston,'' he can be heard saying on a 911 tape, his voice full of desperation. ``Can you hear me? Daddy loves you. Holston. Holston, please. Please.'' [[Page S2647]] Holston was pronounced dead that morning. The local authorities have been weighing what can be a difficult decision for prosecutors and the police after these shootings: Whether to charge a stricken parent or family member with a crime. While laws vary among states, experts said decisions about prosecution hinge on the specific details and circumstances of each shooting. What may be criminal neglect in one child's death may be legally seen as a tragic mistake in another. Officials with the Paulding County Sheriff's Office have suggested that they expect Mr. Cole to face, at most, a charge of reckless conduct. ``Anything that we do, criminally speaking, is not going to hold a candle to the pain that this family feels,'' said Sgt. Ashley Henson, a spokesman for the sheriff's office. Sergeant Henson said investigators had sensed early on that the shooting was accidental. ``You want to be able to protect your family and take care of your family, but on the same hand, you've got to be safe with your weapons,'' he said. Some gun control groups have urged states and district attorneys to prosecute such cases more aggressively, saying that, grief aside, people need to be held responsible for what are easily preventable deaths. Brent Moxey, the pastor who officiated at Holston's funeral, said the boy's father was already haunted. ``I think he runs the scenario over and over and over in his mind.'' Mr. Moxey said the family--which did not respond to a message left at their home seeking comment--was still asking for privacy. About 1,000 mourners attended Holston's funeral on April 30, remembering a boy who loved superheroes and would sometimes wrestle cardboard boxes. The day he died, he spent time alongside his mother, Haley, as she read the Bible, playing with the highlighter pen she used to note passages, Mr. Moxey said. ``This little boy loved to tinker and to play, and he loved to get into things,'' Mr. Moxey said, describing the very impulse that probably led to Holston's death. ``He loved to figure out how stuff works.'' A Ringing Purse In Indianapolis, Kanisha Shelton would stay protectively near her 2-year-old son, Kiyan, watchful of the stray dogs known to roam through the neighborhood. But on the night of April 20, Ms. Shelton stepped away from the boy, leaving him in the kitchen while she was upstairs. She had placed her purse out of his reach on the kitchen counter, but when her phone started ringing, the boy apparently pushed a chair close to the counter, climbed onto it and reached for the purse, according to an account from a cousin, John Pearson. There was also a .380-caliber Bersa pistol in it. Just after 9 p.m., Ms. Shelton heard a loud bang and rushed downstairs. There, in the kitchen, she found Kiyan lying on the floor, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the chest. He was rushed to a local children's hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Ms. Shelton's mother, who answered her daughter's cellphone, said the family did not want to speak about the death. No criminal charges have been filed. The police in Indianapolis said such scenes were becoming more common. ``The mother was obviously very shaken up,'' Capt. Richard Riddle said. Indeed, on Sunday night, another child, 10 years old, died in what the police say appears to have been another accidental shooting. A 2013 investigation by The New York Times of children killed with firearms found that accidental shootings like these were being vastly undercounted by official tabulations, and were occurring about twice as often as records said. Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, an emergency physician and a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who studies the public health effects of gun violence, said that nearly everyone--from toddlers to adults--can fail to accurately distinguish toy guns from real guns, loaded guns from unloaded ones. ``That doesn't stop them from playing with it,'' he said. Mr. Pearson said he sympathized with Ms. Shelton and thought of Kiyan's death as a tragic accident. ``It was up on the counter, so I do think she thought she put the gun away, out of the baby's reach,'' Mr. Pearson said. ``She's going to be in a living hell.'' Essie Jones, who lives across the street, said Ms. Shelton had recently taught Kiyan to ride a small bicycle with training wheels, guiding him on the bike in the driveway. ``They'd be up in the yard playing,'' she said. ``He was very happy.'' In a condolence book online, Dianna Mitchell-Wright, who identified herself as ``Auntie,'' wrote of her anguish over losing the boy she had nicknamed ``My Main Man.'' ``All I have are memories,'' she said, ``and your pictures in my cellphone.'' Anguished Goodbyes The coffin that held Za'veon was no bigger than a piece of carry-on luggage, and it was so light that two pallbearers easily carried it through the packed St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church in Bermuda, La. His full name was Za'veon Amari Williams, but to his family in Natchitoches, the 3-year-old was known as Baby Zee. On April 22, he found a pistol and shot himself in the head, according to Detective John Greely of the Natchitoches Police Department. When paramedics arrived, they found the mother cradling the boy and crying that he was not breathing, according to KSLA News 12. The police arrested a companion of the mother, Alverious Demars, 22, on charges of negligent homicide and obstruction of justice. Detective Greely said that the police believed that the pistol belonged to Mr. Demars, and that he hid it after the toddler shot himself. The police have not found the weapon. ``As a responsible adult it's his obligation to secure that--to make sure a child does not get ahold of it,'' Detective Greely said, explaining why Mr. Demars had been arrested. The family declined to speak, but in a Facebook post, the boy's mother, Destiny Williams, wrote that she had not been able to sleep and was a ``useless sad waste.'' ``I can't take life,'' she wrote. ``Why is it so cruel and unrelenting and unforgiving.'' The funerals for these children were filled with a similar anguish. At the funeral for Baby Zee, the wails and screams grew so loud during a final moment of goodbye that ushers closed the church doors to give the family privacy. In Georgia, Holston's father tearfully read a letter that reflected on how the family used to sing ``Jesus Loves Me.'' At the Kansas City funeral for Sha'Quille, family members crumpled as they looked into the coffin, shaking with tears or kissing her. The day after Sha'Quille was buried, her maternal grandmother, Pamala Kornegay, reflected on the girl who was missing from the cluster of grandchildren who sat coloring on her living room floor. Ms. Kornegay said she was not angry with Sha'Quille's father. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, the article included harrowing stories like this one: Sha'Quille Kornegay, 2 years old, was buried in a pink coffin, her favorite doll by her side and a tiara strategically placed to hide the self-inflicted gunshot wound to her forehead. She had been napping in bed with her father late last month when she discovered the 9-millimeter handgun he often kept under his pillow in his Kansas City, Missouri home. It was equipped with a laser sight that lit up like the red lights on her cousins' sneakers. Her father told the police he woke to see Sha'Quille by his bed, bleeding and crying, the gun at her feet. A bullet had pierced her skull. On the night of April 20th, Kanisha Shelton had placed her purse out of her 2-year-old son Kiyan's reach on the kitchen counter, but when her phone started ringing, the boy apparently pushed a chair close to the counter, climbed onto it and reached for the purse. There was also a .380-caliber Beretta pistol in it. Just after 9 p.m., Ms. Shelton heard a loud bang and rushed downstairs. There, in the kitchen, she found Kiyan lying on the floor, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the chest. The police in Indianapolis said such scenes were becoming more common. As someone who has advocated for commonsense protections against gun violence for decades and now as a Senator from Connecticut, where we know all too well the horrors of gun violence and the deep wounds and death they can wreak on innocent children, and especially as a parent of four children who have been those ages, these stories, for me, are truly heartrending and gut-wrenching. My heart goes out to the families of these children and the families of countless other children who were lost as a result of these gun deaths--too many such families too often and so many of them preventable. Last year, there were 278 unintentional shootings by young children or teenagers, most of them having no idea what they were doing. In the week at the end of this April when four toddlers shot themselves, at least five other children and teenagers accidentally shot themselves or other people. Indepth investigations have strongly suggested that these shootings are significantly undercounted because of differing rules across the country and jurisdictions about how such deaths are to be reported. Some areas designate any death in which one person shoots another as a homicide, even if the shooter is 2 years old and has no intent to kill. The gun lobby relies on these misleading statistics to oppose laws that could reduce and prevent these kinds of heart-wrenching stories and deaths, such as safe storage laws or technology such as trigger locks. How could they be opposed? The gun lobby argues that these deaths are vanishingly rare, outpaced by other causes of child mortality. Of course, they perpetuate the misinformation by continuing to oppose any research, any fact-finding into gun violence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, continuing to even block our ability to better understand the problem, let alone address it. I continue to have great difficulty understanding the anti-safety advocacy of these groups. Time and again in American history we have recognized that products posing a risk to consumers--particularly to children--require regulation to make them as safe [[Page S2648]] as possible, no matter what the product, no matter what the industry. That has been the American way. We put seatbelts in cars and require drivers to learn what they are doing in obtaining a license. We put childproof caps on medicine bottles and dangerous household products, even if they have domestic uses. If we have taken concrete steps to ensure that children can't open a bottle of aspirin, I am baffled that we can't do more to prevent these violent deaths. Why aren't we doing everything we can to make sure that children can't kill themselves or others or injure themselves or others with firearms? There is no lack of ideas for how to remedy this situation. President Obama recently announced that as part of the White House's anti-gun violence initiative, he will move forward to promote the development of smart gun technology which is designed to ensure that no one except the owner can fire it. Even if the gun makes it into the hands of someone who should not have it, whether a child or a criminal, the gun will not be accessible. Like other steps the President has outlined in the absence of congressional action which remains sorely needed, this smart gun initiative utilizes existing laws and resources to challenge research, innovation, and enforcement toward more effectively cutting down on gun violence. Surely, we have a consensus among the American people, among gun owners, and among anybody belonging to groups that seemingly oppose these commonsense measures that we need to do more and do it better to prevent these child deaths. On smart guns in particular, the White House will provide guidance for enhancing safety technology and help to manufacture and test smart firearms and to facilitate their purchase by State and local governments. Working in partnership with private sector innovators and local jurisdictions, this initiative holds tremendous promise. Even while smart guns that depend on advanced technology are being developed, existing mechanisms provide remedies as well--low-tech remedies. Trigger locks and indicators of whether a gun is loaded are in widespread use today. Studies have suggested that a third of accidental deaths could be prevented by the use of childproof safety locks and loading indicators. Our laws should encourage and even require their adoption. States around the country have also developed a variety of safe storage bills that prohibit storing firearms in places that are accessible to children. Tragic experience has shown us that, as important as it is for families to discuss guns with their children, simply admonishing them to avoid going near guns won't work, particularly when the children are too young to understand what guns are and what they can do, and, most especially, when they are playing with other children in other families' homes, where those guns may be accessible and loaded. The answer is to insist that adults take responsibility. They need to be held responsible for keeping firearms off limits, which is really the only realistic option to cut down these tragic deaths of children. Laws requiring that kind of responsibility and accountability are supported by two-thirds of Americans. Unfortunately, the gun lobby has continually, constantly, insistently, and consistently opposed progress in these areas. Their steadfast opposition has also prevented the Consumer Product Safety Commission--which has a praiseworthy track record of success keeping children safe from hazards and ranging from lead in toys to dangerous cribs--from regulating firearms or even issuing guidance about how they could be designed more safely for children. I have been coming to the floor of the Senate for a number of years to speak about the need for legislation to address the gun violence epidemic in this country, clearly a public health crisis. If there were a flu epidemic or another kind of contagious disease causing 30,000 deaths a year, we would have urgent, drastic action. We need to do the right thing. There are stories reported such as those last week of the unspeakable horror of a child too young to understand what is happening who encounters a gun and uses it, such as Sha'Quille, Kiyan, and Holston Cole, a 3-year-old boy with crackling energy, who would wake right before dawn. His pastor said: He loved singing ``Jesus Loves Me.'' He put a gun to his head and, unknowingly, pulled the trigger. We can avoid that type of tragedy. We can do better, and we must act. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2646-S2648] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN VIOLENCE Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, during our break, last Thursday the New York Times ran a story that was as heartrending and gut-wrenching as I have read in a long time.

Zai Deshields, 4, pulled a handgun out of a backpack at her grandmother's home in Arlington, Tex., and shot her uncle in the leg. A child who accidentally pulls the trigger is most likely to be 3 years old, the statistics show. Holston Cole was 3, a boy crackling with energy who would wake before dawn, his pastor said. He loved singing ``Jesus Loves Me'' and bouncing inside the inflatable castle in his family's front yard in Dallas, Ga. About 7 a.m. on April 26, he found a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol in his father's backpack, according to investigators. The gun fired, and Holston's panicked father, David, called 911. Even before a dispatcher could speak, Mr. Cole wailed ``No, no!'' into the phone, according to a redacted recording. Mr. Cole pleaded for his 3-year-old son to hold on until the ambulance could arrive: ``Stay with me, Holston,'' he can be heard saying on a 911 tape, his voice full of desperation. ``Can you hear me? Daddy loves you. Holston. Holston, please. Please.'' [[Page S2647]] Holston was pronounced dead that morning. The local authorities have been weighing what can be a difficult decision for prosecutors and the police after these shootings: Whether to charge a stricken parent or family member with a crime. While laws vary among states, experts said decisions about prosecution hinge on the specific details and circumstances of each shooting. What may be criminal neglect in one child's death may be legally seen as a tragic mistake in another. Officials with the Paulding County Sheriff's Office have suggested that they expect Mr. Cole to face, at most, a charge of reckless conduct. ``Anything that we do, criminally speaking, is not going to hold a candle to the pain that this family feels,'' said Sgt. Ashley Henson, a spokesman for the sheriff's office. Sergeant Henson said investigators had sensed early on that the shooting was accidental. ``You want to be able to protect your family and take care of your family, but on the same hand, you've got to be safe with your weapons,'' he said. Some gun control groups have urged states and district attorneys to prosecute such cases more aggressively, saying that, grief aside, people need to be held responsible for what are easily preventable deaths. Brent Moxey, the pastor who officiated at Holston's funeral, said the boy's father was already haunted. ``I think he runs the scenario over and over and over in his mind.'' Mr. Moxey said the family--which did not respond to a message left at their home seeking comment--was still asking for privacy. About 1,000 mourners attended Holston's funeral on April 30, remembering a boy who loved superheroes and would sometimes wrestle cardboard boxes. The day he died, he spent time alongside his mother, Haley, as she read the Bible, playing with the highlighter pen she used to note passages, Mr. Moxey said. ``This little boy loved to tinker and to play, and he loved to get into things,'' Mr. Moxey said, describing the very impulse that probably led to Holston's death. ``He loved to figure out how stuff works.'' A Ringing Purse In Indianapolis, Kanisha Shelton would stay protectively near her 2-year-old son, Kiyan, watchful of the stray dogs known to roam through the neighborhood. But on the night of April 20, Ms. Shelton stepped away from the boy, leaving him in the kitchen while she was upstairs. She had placed her purse out of his reach on the kitchen counter, but when her phone started ringing, the boy apparently pushed a chair close to the counter, climbed onto it and reached for the purse, according to an account from a cousin, John Pearson. There was also a .380-caliber Bersa pistol in it. Just after 9 p.m., Ms. Shelton heard a loud bang and rushed downstairs. There, in the kitchen, she found Kiyan lying on the floor, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the chest. He was rushed to a local children's hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Ms. Shelton's mother, who answered her daughter's cellphone, said the family did not want to speak about the death. No criminal charges have been filed. The police in Indianapolis said such scenes were becoming more common. ``The mother was obviously very shaken up,'' Capt. Richard Riddle said. Indeed, on Sunday night, another child, 10 years old, died in what the police say appears to have been another accidental shooting. A 2013 investigation by The New York Times of children killed with firearms found that accidental shootings like these were being vastly undercounted by official tabulations, and were occurring about twice as often as records said. Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, an emergency physician and a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who studies the public health effects of gun violence, said that nearly everyone--from toddlers to adults--can fail to accurately distinguish toy guns from real guns, loaded guns from unloaded ones. ``That doesn't stop them from playing with it,'' he said. Mr. Pearson said he sympathized with Ms. Shelton and thought of Kiyan's death as a tragic accident. ``It was up on the counter, so I do think she thought she put the gun away, out of the baby's reach,'' Mr. Pearson said. ``She's going to be in a living hell.'' Essie Jones, who lives across the street, said Ms. Shelton had recently taught Kiyan to ride a small bicycle with training wheels, guiding him on the bike in the driveway. ``They'd be up in the yard playing,'' she said. ``He was very happy.'' In a condolence book online, Dianna Mitchell-Wright, who identified herself as ``Auntie,'' wrote of her anguish over losing the boy she had nicknamed ``My Main Man.'' ``All I have are memories,'' she said, ``and your pictures in my cellphone.'' Anguished Goodbyes The coffin that held Za'veon was no bigger than a piece of carry-on luggage, and it was so light that two pallbearers easily carried it through the packed St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church in Bermuda, La. His full name was Za'veon Amari Williams, but to his family in Natchitoches, the 3-year-old was known as Baby Zee. On April 22, he found a pistol and shot himself in the head, according to Detective John Greely of the Natchitoches Police Department. When paramedics arrived, they found the mother cradling the boy and crying that he was not breathing, according to KSLA News 12. The police arrested a companion of the mother, Alverious Demars, 22, on charges of negligent homicide and obstruction of justice. Detective Greely said that the police believed that the pistol belonged to Mr. Demars, and that he hid it after the toddler shot himself. The police have not found the weapon. ``As a responsible adult it's his obligation to secure that--to make sure a child does not get ahold of it,'' Detective Greely said, explaining why Mr. Demars had been arrested. The family declined to speak, but in a Facebook post, the boy's mother, Destiny Williams, wrote that she had not been able to sleep and was a ``useless sad waste.'' ``I can't take life,'' she wrote. ``Why is it so cruel and unrelenting and unforgiving.'' The funerals for these children were filled with a similar anguish. At the funeral for Baby Zee, the wails and screams grew so loud during a final moment of goodbye that ushers closed the church doors to give the family privacy. In Georgia, Holston's father tearfully read a letter that reflected on how the family used to sing ``Jesus Loves Me.'' At the Kansas City funeral for Sha'Quille, family members crumpled as they looked into the coffin, shaking with tears or kissing her. The day after Sha'Quille was buried, her maternal grandmother, Pamala Kornegay, reflected on the girl who was missing from the cluster of grandchildren who sat coloring on her living room floor. Ms. Kornegay said she was not angry with Sha'Quille's father. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, the article included harrowing stories like this one: Sha'Quille Kornegay, 2 years old, was buried in a pink coffin, her favorite doll by her side and a tiara strategically placed to hide the self-inflicted gunshot wound to her forehead. She had been napping in bed with her father late last month when she discovered the 9-millimeter handgun he often kept under his pillow in his Kansas City, Missouri home. It was equipped with a laser sight that lit up like the red lights on her cousins' sneakers. Her father told the police he woke to see Sha'Quille by his bed, bleeding and crying, the gun at her feet. A bullet had pierced her skull. On the night of April 20th, Kanisha Shelton had placed her purse out of her 2-year-old son Kiyan's reach on the kitchen counter, but when her phone started ringing, the boy apparently pushed a chair close to the counter, climbed onto it and reached for the purse. There was also a .380-caliber Beretta pistol in it. Just after 9 p.m., Ms. Shelton heard a loud bang and rushed downstairs. There, in the kitchen, she found Kiyan lying on the floor, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the chest. The police in Indianapolis said such scenes were becoming more common. As someone who has advocated for commonsense protections against gun violence for decades and now as a Senator from Connecticut, where we know all too well the horrors of gun violence and the deep wounds and death they can wreak on innocent children, and especially as a parent of four children who have been those ages, these stories, for me, are truly heartrending and gut-wrenching. My heart goes out to the families of these children and the families of countless other children who were lost as a result of these gun deaths--too many such families too often and so many of them preventable. Last year, there were 278 unintentional shootings by young children or teenagers, most of them having no idea what they were doing. In the week at the end of this April when four toddlers shot themselves, at least five other children and teenagers accidentally shot themselves or other people. Indepth investigations have strongly suggested that these shootings are significantly undercounted because of differing rules across the country and jurisdictions about how such deaths are to be reported. Some areas designate any death in which one person shoots another as a homicide, even if the shooter is 2 years old and has no intent to kill. The gun lobby relies on these misleading statistics to oppose laws that could reduce and prevent these kinds of heart-wrenching stories and deaths, such as safe storage laws or technology such as trigger locks. How could they be opposed? The gun lobby argues that these deaths are vanishingly rare, outpaced by other causes of child mortality. Of course, they perpetuate the misinformation by continuing to oppose any research, any fact-finding into gun violence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, continuing to even block our ability to better understand the problem, let alone address it. I continue to have great difficulty understanding the anti-safety advocacy of these groups. Time and again in American history we have recognized that products posing a risk to consumers--particularly to children--require regulation to make them as safe [[Page S2648]] as possible, no matter what the product, no matter what the industry. That has been the American way. We put seatbelts in cars and require drivers to learn what they are doing in obtaining a license. We put childproof caps on medicine bottles and dangerous household products, even if they have domestic uses. If we have taken concrete steps to ensure that children can't open a bottle of aspirin, I am baffled that we can't do more to prevent these violent deaths. Why aren't we doing everything we can to make sure that children can't kill themselves or others or injure themselves or others with firearms? There is no lack of ideas for how to remedy this situation. President Obama recently announced that as part of the White House's anti-gun violence initiative, he will move forward to promote the development of smart gun technology which is designed to ensure that no one except the owner can fire it. Even if the gun makes it into the hands of someone who should not have it, whether a child or a criminal, the gun will not be accessible. Like other steps the President has outlined in the absence of congressional action which remains sorely needed, this smart gun initiative utilizes existing laws and resources to challenge research, innovation, and enforcement toward more effectively cutting down on gun violence. Surely, we have a consensus among the American people, among gun owners, and among anybody belonging to groups that seemingly oppose these commonsense measures that we need to do more and do it better to prevent these child deaths. On smart guns in particular, the White House will provide guidance for enhancing safety technology and help to manufacture and test smart firearms and to facilitate their purchase by State and local governments. Working in partnership with private sector innovators and local jurisdictions, this initiative holds tremendous promise. Even while smart guns that depend on advanced technology are being developed, existing mechanisms provide remedies as well--low-tech remedies. Trigger locks and indicators of whether a gun is loaded are in widespread use today. Studies have suggested that a third of accidental deaths could be prevented by the use of childproof safety locks and loading indicators. Our laws should encourage and even require their adoption. States around the country have also developed a variety of safe storage bills that prohibit storing firearms in places that are accessible to children. Tragic experience has shown us that, as important as it is for families to discuss guns with their children, simply admonishing them to avoid going near guns won't work, particularly when the children are too young to understand what guns are and what they can do, and, most especially, when they are playing with other children in other families' homes, where those guns may be accessible and loaded. The answer is to insist that adults take responsibility. They need to be held responsible for keeping firearms off limits, which is really the only realistic option to cut down these tragic deaths of children. Laws requiring that kind of responsibility and accountability are supported by two-thirds of Americans. Unfortunately, the gun lobby has continually, constantly, insistently, and consistently opposed progress in these areas. Their steadfast opposition has also prevented the Consumer Product Safety Commission--which has a praiseworthy track record of success keeping children safe from hazards and ranging from lead in toys to dangerous cribs--from regulating firearms or even issuing guidance about how they could be designed more safely for children. I have been coming to the floor of the Senate for a number of years to speak about the need for legislation to address the gun violence epidemic in this country, clearly a public health crisis. If there were a flu epidemic or another kind of contagious disease causing 30,000 deaths a year, we would have urgent, drastic action. We need to do the right thing. There are stories reported such as those last week of the unspeakable horror of a child too young to understand what is happening who encounters a gun and uses it, such as Sha'Quille, Kiyan, and Holston Cole, a 3-year-old boy with crackling energy, who would wake right before dawn. His pastor said: He loved singing ``Jesus Loves Me.'' He put a gun to his head and, unknowingly, pulled the trigger. We can avoid that type of tragedy. We can do better, and we must act. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2646-S2648] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN VIOLENCE Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, during our break, last Thursday the New York Times ran a story that was as heartrending and gut-wrenching as I have read in a long time. The headline was: ``One Week in April, Four Toddlers Shot and Killed Themselves.'' I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the New York Times, May 5, 2016] One Week in April, Four Toddlers Shot and Killed Themselves (By Jack Healy, Julie Bosman, Alan Blinder, and Julie Turkewitz) Kansas City, Mo.--Sha'Quille Kornegay, 2 years old, was buried in a pink coffin, her favorite doll by her side and a tiara strategically placed to hide the self-inflicted gunshot wound to her forehead. She had been napping in bed with her father, Courtenay Block, late last month when she discovered the 9-millimeter handgun he often kept under his pillow in his Kansas City, Mo., home. It was equipped with a laser sight that lit up like the red lights on her cousins' sneakers. Mr. Block told the police he woke to see Sha'Quille by his bed, bleeding and crying, the gun at her feet. A bullet had pierced her skull. In a country with more than 30,000 annual gun deaths, the smallest fingers on the trigger belong to children like Sha'Quille. During a single week in April, four toddlers--Holston, Kiyan, Za'veon and Sha'Quille--shot and killed themselves, and a mother driving through Milwaukee was killed after her 2-year-old apparently picked up a gun that had slid out from under the driver's seat. It was a brutal stretch, even by the standards of researchers who track these shootings. These are shooters who need help tying their shoelaces, too young sometimes to even say the word ``gun,'' killed by their own curiosity. They accidentally fire a parent's pistol while playing cops and robbers, while riding in a shopping cart, after finding it in the pocket of the coat their father forgot to wear to work. The gun that killed Sha'Quille last Thursday was pointing up, as if being inspected, when it fired. They are the most maddening gun deaths in America. Last year, at least 30 people were killed in accidental shootings in which the shooter was 5 or younger, according to Everytown For Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group that tracks these shootings, largely through news reports. With shootings by preschoolers happening at a pace of about two per week, some of the victims were the youngsters' parents or siblings, but in many cases the children ended up taking their own lives. ``You can't call this a tragic accident,'' said Jean Peters Baker, the prosecutor of Jackson County, Mo., who is overseeing the criminal case in Sha'Quille's death. Her office charged Mr. Block, 24, with second-degree murder and child endangerment. ``These are really preventable, and we're not willing to prevent them.'' Gun control advocates say these deaths illustrate lethal gaps in gun safety laws. Some states require locked storage of guns or trigger locks to be sold with handguns. Others leave safety decisions largely to gun owners. Twenty-seven states have laws that hold adults responsible for letting children have unsupervised access to guns, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, though experts say such measures have, at best, a small effect on reducing gun deaths. Massachusetts is the only state that requires gun owners to store their guns in a locked place, though it has not stopped youngsters there from accidentally killing themselves or other children. Gun rights groups have long opposed these kinds of laws. They argue that trigger locks can fail, that mandatory storage can put a gun out of reach in an emergency, and that such measures infringe on Second Amendment rights. ``It's clearly a tragedy, but it's not something that's widespread,'' said Larry Pratt, a spokesman and former executive director of Gun Owners of America. ``To base public policy on occasional mishaps would be a grave mistake.'' In Kansas City, Sha'Quille's family is trying to come to grips with her death and the murder charge facing Mr. Block. In interviews, several relatives said they did not believe he deserved to be convicted of felony murder, but some questioned his judgment in leaving a loaded gun out while he slept as well as his actions after he discovered that his daughter was grievously wounded. According to court records, Mr. Block told the police that immediately after the shooting, he went to the bathroom, wrapped the gun in a shirt and put it into a vent in the floor. He then ran outside carrying his dying daughter and yelled for a neighbor to call for help. He was also charged with evidence tampering. Sha'Quille's mother, Montorre Kornegay, said that she had recently separated from Mr. Block after more than five years together, but that they remained close. She said he loved the girl, whose first word was ``Daddy.'' When he called Ms. Kornegay from jail, he told her he was sorry and talked about how much he missed Sha'Quille. The girl was just 2, but wanted to be older, telling people she was already 5. She would run through the house, playing her own private game of peekaboo, relatives said. In a cacophony of squeaky children at home, relatives could always distinguish Sha'Quille's low, raspier voice. One day, she'll be a singer, they told one another. ``What happened was wrong,'' Ms. Kornegay said. She said that she did not think Mr. Block deserved to face a murder charge, but that he had behaved irresponsibly. ``Why didn't you stay up and watch her?'' Parents, police officers and neighbors from Georgia to California are asking similar painful questions this week. Here are some of their stories. `Stay With Me' In 2015, there were at least 278 unintentional shootings at the hands of young children and teenagers, according to Everytown's database. During the week in April when Sha'Quille and the other children died, there were at least five other accidental shootings by children and teenagers. Alysee Defee, 13, was shot in the armpit with a 20-gauge shotgun she had used for turkey hunting in Floyd County, Ind. Zai Deshields, 4, pulled a handgun out of a backpack at her grandmother's home in Arlington, Tex., and shot her uncle in the leg. A child who accidentally pulls the trigger is most likely to be 3 years old, the statistics show. Holston Cole was 3, a boy crackling with energy who would wake before dawn, his pastor said. He loved singing ``Jesus Loves Me'' and bouncing inside the inflatable castle in his family's front yard in Dallas, Ga. About 7 a.m. on April 26, he found a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol in his father's backpack, according to investigators. The gun fired, and Holston's panicked father, David, called 911. Even before a dispatcher could speak, Mr. Cole wailed ``No, no!'' into the phone, according to a redacted recording. Mr. Cole pleaded for his 3-year-old son to hold on until the ambulance could arrive: ``Stay with me, Holston,'' he can be heard saying on a 911 tape, his voice full of desperation. ``Can you hear me? Daddy loves you. Holston. Holston, please. Please.'' [[Page S2647]] Holston was pronounced dead that morning. The local authorities have been weighing what can be a difficult decision for prosecutors and the police after these shootings: Whether to charge a stricken parent or family member with a crime. While laws vary among states, experts said decisions about prosecution hinge on the specific details and circumstances of each shooting. What may be criminal neglect in one child's death may be legally seen as a tragic mistake in another. Officials with the Paulding County Sheriff's Office have suggested that they expect Mr. Cole to face, at most, a charge of reckless conduct. ``Anything that we do, criminally speaking, is not going to hold a candle to the pain that this family feels,'' said Sgt.

Some gun control groups have urged states and district attorneys to prosecute such cases more aggressively, saying that, grief aside, people need to be held responsible for what are easily preventable deaths. Brent Moxey, the pastor who officiated at Holston's funeral, said the boy's father was already haunted. ``I think he runs the scenario over and over and over in his mind.'' Mr. Moxey said the family--which did not respond to a message left at their home seeking comment--was still asking for privacy. About 1,000 mourners attended Holston's funeral on April 30, remembering a boy who loved superheroes and would sometimes wrestle cardboard boxes. The day he died, he spent time alongside his mother, Haley, as she read the Bible, playing with the highlighter pen she used to note passages, Mr. Moxey said. ``This little boy loved to tinker and to play, and he loved to get into things,'' Mr. Moxey said, describing the very impulse that probably led to Holston's death. ``He loved to figure out how stuff works.'' A Ringing Purse In Indianapolis, Kanisha Shelton would stay protectively near her 2-year-old son, Kiyan, watchful of the stray dogs known to roam through the neighborhood. But on the night of April 20, Ms. Shelton stepped away from the boy, leaving him in the kitchen while she was upstairs. She had placed her purse out of his reach on the kitchen counter, but when her phone started ringing, the boy apparently pushed a chair close to the counter, climbed onto it and reached for the purse, according to an account from a cousin, John Pearson. There was also a .380-caliber Bersa pistol in it. Just after 9 p.m., Ms. Shelton heard a loud bang and rushed downstairs. There, in the kitchen, she found Kiyan lying on the floor, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the chest. He was rushed to a local children's hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Ms. Shelton's mother, who answered her daughter's cellphone, said the family did not want to speak about the death. No criminal charges have been filed. The police in Indianapolis said such scenes were becoming more common. ``The mother was obviously very shaken up,'' Capt. Richard Riddle said. Indeed, on Sunday night, another child, 10 years old, died in what the police say appears to have been another accidental shooting. A 2013 investigation by The New York Times of children killed with firearms found that accidental shootings like these were being vastly undercounted by official tabulations, and were occurring about twice as often as records said. Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, an emergency physician and a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who studies the public health effects of gun violence, said that nearly everyone--from toddlers to adults--can fail to accurately distinguish toy guns from real guns, loaded guns from unloaded ones. ``That doesn't stop them from playing with it,'' he said. Mr. Pearson said he sympathized with Ms. Shelton and thought of Kiyan's death as a tragic accident. ``It was up on the counter, so I do think she thought she put the gun away, out of the baby's reach,'' Mr. Pearson said. ``She's going to be in a living hell.'' Essie Jones, who lives across the street, said Ms. Shelton had recently taught Kiyan to ride a small bicycle with training wheels, guiding him on the bike in the driveway. ``They'd be up in the yard playing,'' she said. ``He was very happy.'' In a condolence book online, Dianna Mitchell-Wright, who identified herself as ``Auntie,'' wrote of her anguish over losing the boy she had nicknamed ``My Main Man.'' ``All I have are memories,'' she said, ``and your pictures in my cellphone.'' Anguished Goodbyes The coffin that held Za'veon was no bigger than a piece of carry-on luggage, and it was so light that two pallbearers easily carried it through the packed St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church in Bermuda, La. His full name was Za'veon Amari Williams, but to his family in Natchitoches, the 3-year-old was known as Baby Zee. On April 22, he found a pistol and shot himself in the head, according to Detective John Greely of the Natchitoches Police Department. When paramedics arrived, they found the mother cradling the boy and crying that he was not breathing, according to KSLA News 12. The police arrested a companion of the mother, Alverious Demars, 22, on charges of negligent homicide and obstruction of justice. Detective Greely said that the police believed that the pistol belonged to Mr. Demars, and that he hid it after the toddler shot himself. The police have not found the weapon. ``As a responsible adult it's his obligation to secure that--to make sure a child does not get ahold of it,'' Detective Greely said, explaining why Mr. Demars had been arrested. The family declined to speak, but in a Facebook post, the boy's mother, Destiny Williams, wrote that she had not been able to sleep and was a ``useless sad waste.'' ``I can't take life,'' she wrote. ``Why is it so cruel and unrelenting and unforgiving.'' The funerals for these children were filled with a similar anguish. At the funeral for Baby Zee, the wails and screams grew so loud during a final moment of goodbye that ushers closed the church doors to give the family privacy. In Georgia, Holston's father tearfully read a letter that reflected on how the family used to sing ``Jesus Loves Me.'' At the Kansas City funeral for Sha'Quille, family members crumpled as they looked into the coffin, shaking with tears or kissing her. The day after Sha'Quille was buried, her maternal grandmother, Pamala Kornegay, reflected on the girl who was missing from the cluster of grandchildren who sat coloring on her living room floor. Ms. Kornegay said she was not angry with Sha'Quille's father. Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

It was equipped with a laser sight that lit up like the red lights on her cousins' sneakers. Her father told the police he woke to see Sha'Quille by his bed, bleeding and crying, the gun at her feet.

Tragic experience has shown us that, as important as it is for families to discuss guns with their children, simply admonishing them to avoid going near guns won't work, particularly when the children are too young to understand what guns are and what they can do, and, most especially, when they are playing with other children in other families' homes, where those guns may be accessible and loaded. The answer is to insist that adults take responsibility. They need to be held responsible for keeping firearms off limits, which is really the only realistic option to cut down these tragic deaths of children. Laws requiring that kind of responsibility and accountability are supported by two-thirds of Americans. Unfortunately, the gun lobby has continually, constantly, insistently, and consistently opposed progress in these areas. Their steadfast opposition has also prevented the Consumer Product Safety Commission--which has a praiseworthy track record of success keeping children safe from hazards and ranging from lead in toys to dangerous cribs--from regulating firearms or even issuing guidance about how they could be designed more safely for children. I have been coming to the floor of the Senate for a number of years to speak about the need for legislation to address the gun violence epidemic in this country, clearly a public health crisis. If there were a flu epidemic or another kind of contagious disease causing 30,000 deaths a year, we would have urgent, drastic action. We need to do the right thing. There are stories reported such as those last week of the unspeakable horror of a child too young to understand what is happening who encounters a gun and uses it, such as Sha'Quille, Kiyan, and Holston Cole, a 3-year-old boy with crackling energy, who would wake right before dawn. His pastor said: He loved singing ``Jesus Loves Me.'' He put a gun to his head and, unknowingly, pulled the trigger. We can avoid that type of tragedy. We can do better, and we must act. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming. ____________________",package_114_174.csv,22056,22056,22120,"[congressional record volume 162, number 72 (monday, may 9, 2016)] [senate] [pages s2646-s2648] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] gun violence mr. blumenthal. mr. president, during our break, last thursday the new york times ran a story that was as heartrending and gut-wrenching as i have read in a long time. the headline was: ``one week in april, four toddlers shot and killed themselves.'' i ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the record. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: [from the new york times, may 5, 2016] one week in april, four toddlers shot and killed themselves (by jack healy, julie bosman, alan blinder, and julie turkewitz) kansas city, mo.--sha'quille kornegay, 2 years old, was buried in a pink coffin, her favorite doll by her side and a tiara strategically placed to hide the self-inflicted gunshot wound to her forehead. she had been napping in bed with her father, courtenay block, late last month when she discovered the 9-millimeter handgun he often kept under his pillow in his kansas city, mo., home. it was equipped with a laser sight that lit up like the red lights on her cousins' sneakers. mr. block told the police he woke to see sha'quille by his bed, bleeding and crying, the gun at her feet. a bullet had pierced her skull. in a country with more than 30,000 annual gun deaths, the smallest fingers on the trigger belong to children like sha'quille. during a single week in april, four toddlers--holston, kiyan, za'veon and sha'quille--shot and killed themselves, and a mother driving through milwaukee was killed after her 2-year-old apparently picked up a gun that had slid out from under the driver's seat. it was a brutal stretch, even by the standards of researchers who track these shootings. these are shooters who need help tying their shoelaces, too young sometimes to even say the word ``gun,'' killed by their own curiosity. they accidentally fire a parent's pistol while playing cops and robbers, while riding in a shopping cart, after finding it in the pocket of the coat their father forgot to wear to work. the gun that killed sha'quille last thursday was pointing up, as if being inspected, when it fired. they are the most maddening gun deaths in america. last year, at least 30 people were killed in accidental shootings in which the shooter was 5 or younger, according to everytown for gun safety, a gun control advocacy group that tracks these shootings, largely through news reports. with shootings by preschoolers happening at a pace of about two per week, some of the victims were the youngsters' parents or siblings, but in many cases the children ended up taking their own lives. ``you can't call this a tragic accident,'' said jean peters baker, the prosecutor of jackson county, mo., who is overseeing the criminal case in sha'quille's death. her office charged mr. block, 24, with second-degree murder and child endangerment. ``these are really preventable, and we're not willing to prevent them.'' gun control advocates say these deaths illustrate lethal gaps in gun safety laws. some states require locked storage of guns or trigger locks to be sold with handguns. others leave safety decisions largely to gun owners. twenty-seven states have laws that hold adults responsible for letting children have unsupervised access to guns, according to the law center to prevent gun violence, though experts say such measures have, at best, a small effect on reducing gun deaths. massachusetts is the only state that requires gun owners to store their guns in a locked place, though it has not stopped youngsters there from accidentally killing themselves or other children. gun rights groups have long opposed these kinds of laws. they argue that trigger locks can fail, that mandatory storage can put a gun out of reach in an emergency, and that such measures infringe on second amendment rights. ``it's clearly a tragedy, but it's not something that's widespread,'' said larry pratt, a spokesman and former executive director of gun owners of america. ``to base public policy on occasional mishaps would be a grave mistake.'' in kansas city, sha'quille's family is trying to come to grips with her death and the murder charge facing mr. block. in interviews, several relatives said they did not believe he deserved to be convicted of felony murder, but some questioned his judgment in leaving a loaded gun out while he slept as well as his actions after he discovered that his daughter was grievously wounded. according to court records, mr. block told the police that immediately after the shooting, he went to the bathroom, wrapped the gun in a shirt and put it into a vent in the floor. he then ran outside carrying his dying daughter and yelled for a neighbor to call for help. he was also charged with evidence tampering. sha'quille's mother, montorre kornegay, said that she had recently separated from mr. block after more than five years together, but that they remained close. she said he loved the girl, whose first word was ``daddy.'' when he called ms. kornegay from jail, he told her he was sorry and talked about how much he missed sha'quille. the girl was just 2, but wanted to be older, telling people she was already 5. she would run through the house, playing her own private game of peekaboo, relatives said. in a cacophony of squeaky children at home, relatives could always distinguish sha'quille's low, raspier voice. one day, she'll be a singer, they told one another. ``what happened was wrong,'' ms. kornegay said. she said that she did not think mr. block deserved to face a murder charge, but that he had behaved irresponsibly. ``why didn't you stay up and watch her?'' parents, police officers and neighbors from georgia to california are asking similar painful questions this week. here are some of their stories. `stay with me' in 2015, there were at least 278 unintentional shootings at the hands of young children and teenagers, according to everytown's database. during the week in april when sha'quille and the other children died, there were at least five other accidental shootings by children and teenagers. alysee defee, 13, was shot in the armpit with a 20-gauge shotgun she had used for turkey hunting in floyd county, ind. zai deshields, 4, pulled a handgun out of a backpack at her grandmother's home in arlington, tex., and shot her uncle in the leg. a child who accidentally pulls the trigger is most likely to be 3 years old, the statistics show. holston cole was 3, a boy crackling with energy who would wake before dawn, his pastor said. he loved singing ``jesus loves me'' and bouncing inside the inflatable castle in his family's front yard in dallas, ga. about 7 a.m. on april 26, he found a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol in his father's backpack, according to investigators. the gun fired, and holston's panicked father, david, called 911. even before a dispatcher could speak, mr. cole wailed ``no, no!'' into the phone, according to a redacted recording. mr. cole pleaded for his 3-year-old son to hold on until the ambulance could arrive: ``stay with me, holston,'' he can be heard saying on a 911 tape, his voice full of desperation. ``can you hear me? daddy loves you. holston. holston, please. please.'' [[page s2647]] holston was pronounced dead that morning. the local authorities have been weighing what can be a difficult decision for prosecutors and the police after these shootings: whether to charge a stricken parent or family member with a crime. while laws vary among states, experts said decisions about prosecution hinge on the specific details and circumstances of each shooting. what may be criminal neglect in one child's death may be legally seen as a tragic mistake in another. officials with the paulding county sheriff's office have suggested that they expect mr. cole to face, at most, a charge of reckless conduct. ``anything that we do, criminally speaking, is not going to hold a candle to the pain that this family feels,'' said sgt. ashley henson, a spokesman for the sheriff's office. sergeant henson said investigators had sensed early on that the shooting was accidental. ``you want to be able to protect your family and take care of your family, but on the same hand, you've got to be safe with your weapons,'' he said. some gun control groups have urged states and district attorneys to prosecute such cases more aggressively, saying that, grief aside, people need to be held responsible for what are easily preventable deaths. brent moxey, the pastor who officiated at holston's funeral, said the boy's father was already haunted. ``i think he runs the scenario over and over and over in his mind.'' mr. moxey said the family--which did not respond to a message left at their home seeking comment--was still asking for privacy. about 1,000 mourners attended holston's funeral on april 30, remembering a boy who loved superheroes and would sometimes wrestle cardboard boxes. the day he died, he spent time alongside his mother, haley, as she read the bible, playing with the highlighter pen she used to note passages, mr. moxey said. ``this little boy loved to tinker and to play, and he loved to get into things,'' mr. moxey said, describing the very impulse that probably led to holston's death. ``he loved to figure out how stuff works.'' a ringing purse in indianapolis, kanisha shelton would stay protectively near her 2-year-old son, kiyan, watchful of the stray dogs known to roam through the neighborhood. but on the night of april 20, ms. shelton stepped away from the boy, leaving him in the kitchen while she was upstairs. she had placed her purse out of his reach on the kitchen counter, but when her phone started ringing, the boy apparently pushed a chair close to the counter, climbed onto it and reached for the purse, according to an account from a cousin, john pearson. there was also a .380-caliber bersa pistol in it. just after 9 p.m., ms. shelton heard a loud bang and rushed downstairs. there, in the kitchen, she found kiyan lying on the floor, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the chest. he was rushed to a local children's hospital, where he was pronounced dead. ms. shelton's mother, who answered her daughter's cellphone, said the family did not want to speak about the death. no criminal charges have been filed. the police in indianapolis said such scenes were becoming more common. ``the mother was obviously very shaken up,'' capt. richard riddle said. indeed, on sunday night, another child, 10 years old, died in what the police say appears to have been another accidental shooting. a 2013 investigation by the new york times of children killed with firearms found that accidental shootings like these were being vastly undercounted by official tabulations, and were occurring about twice as often as records said. dr. garen j. wintemute, an emergency physician and a researcher at the university of california, davis, who studies the public health effects of gun violence, said that nearly everyone--from toddlers to adults--can fail to accurately distinguish toy guns from real guns, loaded guns from unloaded ones. ``that doesn't stop them from playing with it,'' he said. mr. pearson said he sympathized with ms. shelton and thought of kiyan's death as a tragic accident. ``it was up on the counter, so i do think she thought she put the gun away, out of the baby's reach,'' mr. pearson said. ``she's going to be in a living hell.'' essie jones, who lives across the street, said ms. shelton had recently taught kiyan to ride a small bicycle with training wheels, guiding him on the bike in the driveway. ``they'd be up in the yard playing,'' she said. ``he was very happy.'' in a condolence book online, dianna mitchell-wright, who identified herself as ``auntie,'' wrote of her anguish over losing the boy she had nicknamed ``my main man.'' ``all i have are memories,'' she said, ``and your pictures in my cellphone.'' anguished goodbyes the coffin that held za'veon was no bigger than a piece of carry-on luggage, and it was so light that two pallbearers easily carried it through the packed st. paul missionary baptist church in bermuda, la. his full name was za'veon amari williams, but to his family in natchitoches, the 3-year-old was known as baby zee. on april 22, he found a pistol and shot himself in the head, according to detective john greely of the natchitoches police department. when paramedics arrived, they found the mother cradling the boy and crying that he was not breathing, according to ksla news 12. the police arrested a companion of the mother, alverious demars, 22, on charges of negligent homicide and obstruction of justice. detective greely said that the police believed that the pistol belonged to mr. demars, and that he hid it after the toddler shot himself. the police have not found the weapon. ``as a responsible adult it's his obligation to secure that--to make sure a child does not get ahold of it,'' detective greely said, explaining why mr. demars had been arrested. the family declined to speak, but in a facebook post, the boy's mother, destiny williams, wrote that she had not been able to sleep and was a ``useless sad waste.'' ``i can't take life,'' she wrote. ``why is it so cruel and unrelenting and unforgiving.'' the funerals for these children were filled with a similar anguish. at the funeral for baby zee, the wails and screams grew so loud during a final moment of goodbye that ushers closed the church doors to give the family privacy. in georgia, holston's father tearfully read a letter that reflected on how the family used to sing ``jesus loves me.'' at the kansas city funeral for sha'quille, family members crumpled as they looked into the coffin, shaking with tears or kissing her. the day after sha'quille was buried, her maternal grandmother, pamala kornegay, reflected on the girl who was missing from the cluster of grandchildren who sat coloring on her living room floor. ms. kornegay said she was not angry with sha'quille's father. mr. blumenthal. mr. president, the article included harrowing stories like this one: sha'quille kornegay, 2 years old, was buried in a pink coffin, her favorite doll by her side and a tiara strategically placed to hide the self-inflicted gunshot wound to her forehead. she had been napping in bed with her father late last month when she discovered the 9-millimeter handgun he often kept under his pillow in his kansas city, missouri home. it was equipped with a laser sight that lit up like the red lights on her cousins' sneakers. her father told the police he woke to see sha'quille by his bed, bleeding and crying, the gun at her feet. a bullet had pierced her skull. on the night of april 20th, kanisha shelton had placed her purse out of her 2-year-old son kiyan's reach on the kitchen counter, but when her phone started ringing, the boy apparently pushed a chair close to the counter, climbed onto it and reached for the purse. there was also a .380-caliber beretta pistol in it. just after 9 p.m., ms. shelton heard a loud bang and rushed downstairs. there, in the kitchen, she found kiyan lying on the floor, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the chest. the police in indianapolis said such scenes were becoming more common. as someone who has advocated for commonsense protections against gun violence for decades and now as a senator from connecticut, where we know all too well the horrors of gun violence and the deep wounds and death they can wreak on innocent children, and especially as a parent of four children who have been those ages, these stories, for me, are truly heartrending and gut-wrenching. my heart goes out to the families of these children and the families of countless other children who were lost as a result of these gun deaths--too many such families too often and so many of them preventable. last year, there were 278 unintentional shootings by young children or teenagers, most of them having no idea what they were doing. in the week at the end of this april when four toddlers shot themselves, at least five other children and teenagers accidentally shot themselves or other people. indepth investigations have strongly suggested that these shootings are significantly undercounted because of differing rules across the country and jurisdictions about how such deaths are to be reported. some areas designate any death in which one person shoots another as a homicide, even if the shooter is 2 years old and has no intent to kill. the gun lobby relies on these misleading statistics to oppose laws that could reduce and prevent these kinds of heart-wrenching stories and deaths, such as safe storage laws or technology such as trigger locks. how could they be opposed? the gun lobby argues that these deaths are vanishingly rare, outpaced by other causes of child mortality. of course, they perpetuate the misinformation by continuing to oppose any research, any fact-finding into gun violence by the centers for disease control and prevention, continuing to even block our ability to better understand the problem, let alone address it. i continue to have great difficulty understanding the anti-safety advocacy of these groups. time and again in american history we have recognized that products posing a risk to consumers--particularly to children--require regulation to make them as safe [[page s2648]] as possible, no matter what the product, no matter what the industry. that has been the american way. we put seatbelts in cars and require drivers to learn what they are doing in obtaining a license. we put childproof caps on medicine bottles and dangerous household products, even if they have domestic uses. if we have taken concrete steps to ensure that children can't open a bottle of aspirin, i am baffled that we can't do more to prevent these violent deaths. why aren't we doing everything we can to make sure that children can't kill themselves or others or injure themselves or others with firearms? there is no lack of ideas for how to remedy this situation. president obama recently announced that as part of the white house's anti-gun violence initiative, he will move forward to promote the development of smart gun technology which is designed to ensure that no one except the owner can fire it. even if the gun makes it into the hands of someone who should not have it, whether a child or a criminal, the gun will not be accessible. like other steps the president has outlined in the absence of congressional action which remains sorely needed, this smart gun initiative utilizes existing laws and resources to challenge research, innovation, and enforcement toward more effectively cutting down on gun violence. surely, we have a consensus among the american people, among gun owners, and among anybody belonging to groups that seemingly oppose these commonsense measures that we need to do more and do it better to prevent these child deaths. on smart guns in particular, the white house will provide guidance for enhancing safety technology and help to manufacture and test smart firearms and to facilitate their purchase by state and local governments. working in partnership with private sector innovators and local jurisdictions, this initiative holds tremendous promise. even while smart guns that depend on advanced technology are being developed, existing mechanisms provide remedies as well--low-tech remedies. trigger locks and indicators of whether a gun is loaded are in widespread use today. studies have suggested that a third of accidental deaths could be prevented by the use of childproof safety locks and loading indicators. our laws should encourage and even require their adoption. states around the country have also developed a variety of safe storage bills that prohibit storing firearms in places that are accessible to children. tragic experience has shown us that, as important as it is for families to discuss guns with their children, simply admonishing them to avoid going near guns won't work, particularly when the children are too young to understand what guns are and what they can do, and, most especially, when they are playing with other children in other families' homes, where those guns may be accessible and loaded. the answer is to insist that adults take responsibility. they need to be held responsible for keeping firearms off limits, which is really the only realistic option to cut down these tragic deaths of children. laws requiring that kind of responsibility and accountability are supported by two-thirds of americans. unfortunately, the gun lobby has continually, constantly, insistently, and consistently opposed progress in these areas. their steadfast opposition has also prevented the consumer product safety commission--which has a praiseworthy track record of success keeping children safe from hazards and ranging from lead in toys to dangerous cribs--from regulating firearms or even issuing guidance about how they could be designed more safely for children. i have been coming to the floor of the senate for a number of years to speak about the need for legislation to address the gun violence epidemic in this country, clearly a public health crisis. if there were a flu epidemic or another kind of contagious disease causing 30,000 deaths a year, we would have urgent, drastic action. we need to do the right thing. there are stories reported such as those last week of the unspeakable horror of a child too young to understand what is

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 451, S. Res. 436. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 436) supporting the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations, without amendment and with an amendment to the preamble, as follows: (Strike the preamble and insert the part printed in italic.) S. Res. 436 Whereas April 25 of each year is recognized internationally as World Malaria Day; Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in many developing countries, despite being preventable and treatable; Whereas fighting malaria is in the national interest of the United States, as reducing the risk of malaria protects members of the Armed Forces and other people of the United States serving overseas in malaria-endemic regions, and reducing malaria deaths helps to lower risks of instability in less developed countries; Whereas the elimination of malaria remains a bipartisan priority of the United States Government; Whereas, on December 14, 2006, President George W. Bush stated at the White House Malaria Summit, ``So we are acting, and we're leading. And with partners across the world, we are helping the people of Africa turn the tide against malaria. The goal of defeating malaria is a challenging goal, yet it can be done. It's not going to require a miracle, it just requires a smart, sustained, focused effort.''; Whereas, on September 27, 2015, President Barack Obama stated at the United Nations General Assembly, ``Billions of our fellow human beings are at risk of dying from diseases that we know how to prevent. Many children are just one mosquito bite away from death. And that is a moral outrage. It is a profound injustice. It is literally a matter of life and death, and now the world must act.''; Whereas support for efforts to fight malaria is in the diplomatic and moral interest of the United States, as that support generates goodwill toward the United States and highlights the values of the people of the United States through the work of governmental, nongovernmental, and faith- based organizations of the United States; Whereas efforts to fight malaria are in the long-term economic interest of the United States because those efforts help developing countries-- (1) identify at-risk populations; (2) provide a framework for critical emergency disease treatment; (3) provide better health services; (4) increase local governance needed to address substandard and counterfeit medicines that exacerbate malaria resistance; (5) produce healthier and more productive workforces; (6) advance economic development; and (7) promote stronger trading partners; Whereas, in 2015, malaria transmission occurred in 95 countries and territories; Whereas an estimated 3,200,000,000 people are at risk for malaria, with 214,000,000 active cases, the vast majority of whom are in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 90 percent of malaria deaths in the world; Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to and disproportionately affected by malaria; Whereas malaria greatly affects the health of children, as children under the age of 5 account for an estimated 70 percent of malaria deaths each year; Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal and neonatal health, causing complications during delivery, anemia, and low birth weights; Whereas heightened national, regional, and international efforts to prevent and treat malaria during recent years have made significant progress and helped save hundreds of thousands of lives; Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 by the World Health Organization states that, in 2014, approximately 55 percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa slept under an insecticide- treated mosquito net, and household surveys indicated that 90 percent of people used an insecticide-treated mosquito net if such a net was available in the household; Whereas, in 2014, approximately 116,000,000 people were protected by indoor residual spraying; Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 further states that, between 2000 and 2015-- (1) malaria mortality rates decreased by 60 percent around the world; (2) in the African Region of the World Health Organization, malaria mortality rates decreased by 66 percent; and (3) an estimated 6,200,000 malaria deaths were averted globally, primarily as a result of increased interventions; Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 further states that, out of 95 countries and territories with ongoing transmission of malaria in 2015-- (1) 10 countries are classified as being in the pre- elimination phase; (2) 10 countries are classified as being in the elimination phase; and [[Page S2650]] (3) 9 countries are classified as being in the prevention of malaria reintroduction phase of malaria control; Whereas continued national, regional, and international investment in efforts to eliminate malaria, including prevention and treatment efforts, the development of a vaccine to immunize children from the malaria parasite, and advancements in insecticides, are critical in order to-- (1) continue to reduce malaria deaths; (2) prevent backsliding in areas where progress has been made; and (3) equip the United States and the global community with the tools necessary to fight malaria and other global health threats; Whereas the United States Government has played a leading role in the recent progress made toward reducing the global burden of malaria, particularly through the President's Malaria Initiative (referred to in this preamble as the ``PMI'') and the contribution of the United States to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; Whereas, in 2011, an independent, external evaluation, prepared by Boston University, examining 6 objectives of the PMI, found the PMI to be a successful, well-led program that has ``earned and deserves the task of sustaining and expanding the United States Government's response to global malaria control efforts''; Whereas the PMI Strategy 2015-2020 articulates the malaria goal of the United States Government of working with countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and substantially decrease malaria morbidity, towards the long- term goal of elimination; Whereas the United States Government is pursuing a comprehensive approach to ending malaria deaths through the PMI, which is led by the United States Agency for International Development and implemented with assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of State, the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and private sector entities; Whereas the PMI focuses on helping partner countries achieve major improvements in overall health outcomes through improved access to, and quality of, healthcare services in locations with limited resources; and Whereas the PMI, recognizing the burden of malaria on many partner countries, has set a target by 2020 of reducing malaria mortality by \1/3\ from 2015 levels in PMI-supported countries, achieving a greater than 80 percent reduction from original 2000 baseline levels set by the PMI, reducing malaria morbidity in PMI-supported countries by 40 percent from 2015 levels, and assisting not fewer than 5 PMI- supported countries to meet the criteria of the World Health Organization for national or sub-national pre-elimination: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day; (2) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa; (3) commends the recent progress made toward reducing global malaria morbidity, mortality, and prevalence, particularly through the efforts of the President's Malaria Initiative and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; (4) welcomes ongoing public-private partnerships to research and develop more effective and affordable tools for malaria diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination; (5) recognizes the goals, priorities, and authorities to combat malaria set forth in the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-293; 122 Stat. 2918); (6) supports continued leadership by the United States in bilateral, multilateral, and private sector efforts to combat malaria and to work with developing countries to create long- term strategies to increase ownership over malaria programs; and (7) encourages other members of the international community to sustain and increase their support for and financial contributions to efforts to combat malaria worldwide. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to; the committee-reported amendment to the preamble be agreed to; the preamble, as amended, be agreed to; and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.

(2) 10 countries are classified as being in the elimination phase; and [[Page S2650]] (3) 9 countries are classified as being in the prevention of malaria reintroduction phase of malaria control; Whereas continued national, regional, and international investment in efforts to eliminate malaria, including prevention and treatment efforts, the development of a vaccine to immunize children from the malaria parasite, and advancements in insecticides, are critical in order to-- (1) continue to reduce malaria deaths; (2) prevent backsliding in areas where progress has been made; and (3) equip the United States and the global community with the tools necessary to fight malaria and other global health threats; Whereas the United States Government has played a leading role in the recent progress made toward reducing the global burden of malaria, particularly through the President's Malaria Initiative (referred to in this preamble as the ``PMI'') and the contribution of the United States to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; Whereas, in 2011, an independent, external evaluation, prepared by Boston University, examining 6 objectives of the PMI, found the PMI to be a successful, well-led program that has ``earned and deserves the task of sustaining and expanding the United States Government's response to global malaria control efforts''; Whereas the PMI Strategy 2015-2020 articulates the malaria goal of the United States Government of working with countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and substantially decrease malaria morbidity, towards the long- term goal of elimination; Whereas the United States Government is pursuing a comprehensive approach to ending malaria deaths through the PMI, which is led by the United States Agency for International Development and implemented with assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of State, the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and private sector entities; Whereas the PMI focuses on helping partner countries achieve major improvements in overall health outcomes through improved access to, and quality of, healthcare services in locations with limited resources; and Whereas the PMI, recognizing the burden of malaria on many partner countries, has set a target by 2020 of reducing malaria mortality by \1/3\ from 2015 levels in PMI-supported countries, achieving a greater than 80 percent reduction from original 2000 baseline levels set by the PMI, reducing malaria morbidity in PMI-supported countries by 40 percent from 2015 levels, and assisting not fewer than 5 PMI- supported countries to meet the criteria of the World Health Organization for national or sub-national pre-elimination: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day; (2) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa; (3) commends the recent progress made toward reducing global malaria morbidity, mortality, and prevalence, particularly through the efforts of the President's Malaria Initiative and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; (4) welcomes ongoing public-private partnerships to research and develop more effective and affordable tools for malaria diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination; (5) recognizes the goals, priorities, and authorities to combat malaria set forth in the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-293; 122 Stat. 2918); (6) supports continued leadership by the United States in bilateral, multilateral, and private sector efforts to combat malaria and to work with developing countries to create long- term strategies to increase ownership over malaria programs; and (7) encourages other members of the international community to sustain and increase their support for and financial contributions to efforts to combat malaria worldwide.

whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in many developing countries, despite being preventable and treatable; whereas fighting malaria is in the national interest of the united states, as reducing the risk of malaria protects members of the armed forces and other people of the united states serving overseas in malaria-endemic regions, and reducing malaria deaths helps to lower risks of instability in less developed countries; whereas the elimination of malaria remains a bipartisan priority of the united states government; whereas, on december 14, 2006, president george w. bush stated at the white house malaria summit, ``so we are acting, and we're leading. and with partners across the world, we are helping the people of africa turn the tide against malaria. the goal of defeating malaria is a challenging goal, yet it can be done. it's not going to require a miracle, it just requires a smart, sustained, focused effort.'';

whereas support for efforts to fight malaria is in the diplomatic and moral interest of the united states, as that support generates goodwill toward the united states and highlights the values of the people of the united states through the work of governmental, nongovernmental, and faith- based organizations of the united states; whereas efforts to fight malaria are in the long-term economic interest of the united states because those efforts help developing countries-- (1) identify at-risk populations; (2) provide a framework for critical emergency disease treatment; (3) provide better health services; (4) increase local governance needed to address substandard and counterfeit medicines that exacerbate malaria resistance; (5) produce healthier and more productive workforces; (6) advance economic development; and (7) promote stronger trading partners; whereas, in 2015, malaria transmission occurred in 95 countries and territories; whereas an estimated 3,200,000,000 people are at risk for malaria, with 214,000,000 active cases, the vast majority of whom are in sub-saharan africa, which accounts for 90 percent of malaria deaths in the world;

CREC-2016-05-09-pt1-PgS2650,CREC-2016-05-09,114,THE PUBLIC TRUST,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2650-S2652] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE PUBLIC TRUST Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to read into the Record a portion of the New York Times Magazine profile yesterday of Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor to President Obama. Before reading the article, though, titled ``The Story-Teller and the President,'' I wish to explain briefly why I think this piece is so important for us to consider in this Chamber. We live in a time of precipitous change, both in American Government and in communications more broadly. We don't admit it enough in this body, but the Congress in the last decade-plus is extraordinarily weak by historical standards. At the same time, the media is rapidly fragmenting. These two vacuums are being filled by the executive branch in ways that are badly damaging, both to the separation of powers and to the idea of a meaningfully engaged citizenry. There can be little doubt that our Founders would be troubled by what is occurring in our time. Washington is in the process of replacing self-evident truths with self-serving spin, and this is dangerous, for no one is entitled to his or her own facts. I sit intentionally at the desk of Daniel Patrick Moynihan in this body precisely because he was committed to the idea of a shared set of facts before our debates began. Yet this story makes clear that the executive branch feels empowered to proclaim its own narratives. This is bigger than Republicans and Democrats. This is about the legislature's check on the Executive, and it is about all of our accountability in this city to the people. To my Democratic colleagues who supported the Iran deal, does it trouble you at all that the White House displays obvious contempt for you? For your voters and for my voters, will you stand for this kind of fundamentally dishonest spin from future Republican administrations--because I pledge to you that I will not from any administration of either party. Some will say this is just one story of one staffer who wanted to brag and got carried away--someone who wanted to boast about if the whole world could be his canvas, but we should be clear that it is ultimately elected officials who bear responsibility for the ongoing evaporation of public trust in our time. I want to underscore this point. These, my comments tonight, are not about whether you share the President's view that the Iranian nuclear deal was a prudent move or whether you share my view that it was a disaster. That is not the point at issue today. Obviously, foreign policy is critically important, but this story tonight is about whether we take truth seriously. It is about whether we care about the public trust. There is a widespread view around here that our chief job is ``to pass legislation.'' That is incorrect. Our main job, and indeed the oath we took, is to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, which is about limited government and about the separation of powers. Our job is to ensure that the Nation is well governed and that the public can believe that the public can have trust and confidence that the Nation is well governed. This necessarily means that oversight is at least as important as passing or repealing particular pieces of legislation. This horrific story should be a screaming siren to all of us of both parties. Newsrooms are obviously still struggling to understand what vigorous and independent reporting will look like in the digital age, but it remains true that freedom that ordered liberty will remain dependent on an informed citizenry, and that requires a serious and a free press. Good journalism, serious journalism, that takes actual facts seriously and then grapples with those facts honestly, is an important and a high calling. I plan to read about one-fourth of this New York Times piece into the Record, but please note that I will skip over many proper names for ease of audible understanding. Picking up then about 40 percent of the way into the profile, the story continues: The job he [Ben Rhodes] was hired to do, [was] namely to help the President of the United States communicate with the public, [and this job] was changing in equally significant ways, thanks to the impact of digital technologies that people in Washington [[Page S2651]] were just beginning to wrap their minds around. It is hard for many of us to absorb the true magnitude of the changes in the news business--40 percent of newspaper industry professionals have lost their jobs [inside] the last decade-- in part because readers can absorb all [forms of new] news they want from social media platforms like Facebook, which are valued in the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars and pay nothing for the [so-called] ``content'' they provide to their readers. You have to have skin in the game--[that is] to be in the news business, or depend in a life-or-death way on its products--to understand the radical and qualitative ways in which words appear in familiar typefaces [but have yet] been changed. Rhodes [was singling] out a key example to me one day, laced with the brutal contempt that is a hallmark of his private utterances. ``All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,'' he said. ``[But] now they don't. They call us to explain to them what's happening in Moscow [or in] Cairo. [And] most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is [just] 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around [a few] political campaigns. That's a sea change. They literally know nothing.'' In this environment, Rhodes has become adept at ventriloquizing many people at once. Ned Price, Rhodes's assistant, gave me a primer on the way it's done. The easiest way for the White House to shape the news, he explained, is [just] from the briefing podiums, each of which has its own dedicated press corps. ``But then there are [all of these force] multipliers,'' he said, adding, ``We have our compadres, [and I] reach out to a couple [of] people, and you know I wouldn't wanted to name them--'' [I interrupt him and I say] ``I can name them,'' [and I tick] off a few names of prominent Washington reporters and columnists who often tweet in sync with [the] White House['s] messaging [operation]. Price [laughs]. ``I'll say, `Hey, look, some people are spinning this narrative that this is a sign of . . . weakness,' '' he [continues]. [And I interrupt again] ``but--'' ``In fact, it's a sign of strength!'' I [say, chuckling with him]. ``And I'll give them some color,'' Price [continues] ``and the next thing I know, lots of these guys are in the dot-com publishing space, and [they] have [their] huge Twitter followings, and [then] they'll be putting this message [as their own].'' This is something different from old-fashioned spin, which tended to be an art best practiced in person. In a world where experienced reporters competed for scoops and where carrying water for the White House was a cause for shame, no matter which party was in power, it was much harder to sustain a ``narrative'' over any serious period of time. Now the most effectively weaponized 140-character idea or quote will almost always carry the day, and it [will be] very difficult for even good reporters to necessarily know where the spin is coming from or why. When I later visited Obama's former campaign mastermind David Axelrod in Chicago, I brought up the soft Orwellian vibe of an information space where old media structures and hierarchies have been erased by Silicon Valley billionaires who convinced the suckers that information was ``free'' and everyone with access to Google was now a reporter. Axelrod, a former newspaperman, sighed. ``It's not as easy as standing in front of a press conference and speaking to 70 million people like past presidents have been able to do,'' he said. The bully pulpit by and large doesn't exist anymore, he explained. ``So more and more, over the last couple of years, there's been an investment in alternative means of communication: using digital more effectively, going to nontraditional sources, understanding where on each issue your constituencies are going to be found,'' he said. ``I think they've approached these major foreign policy challenges as campaign challenges, and they've run campaigns, and [their] campaigns have been very sophisticated.'' Rhodes's innovative campaign to sell the Iran deal is likely to be a model for how future administrations explain foreign policy to the Congress-- Note that. The administration is going to have to campaign to the Congress-- and the public. The way in which most Americans have heard the story of the Iran deal presented--that the Obama administration began seriously engaging with the Iranian officials in 2013 in order to take advantage of a new political reality in Iran, which came about because of elections that brought [so-called] moderates to power in that country--[this story of 2013] was largely manufactured [``manufactured'' is their verb] for the purpose of selling the deal. Even where the particulars of that story are true, the implications that readers and viewers are encouraged to take away from those particulars are often misleading [and] false. Obama's closest advisers always understood him to be eager [for] a deal with Iran [back in 2012] and even since the beginning of his presidency. ``It's the center of the arc,'' Rhodes explained to me two days after the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was implemented. He then checked off the ways in which the administration's foreign policy aims and priorities converged [in] Iran. ``We don't have to be [in the kind of] cycles of conflict if we can find other ways to resolve these issues,'' he said. ``We can do things that challenge the conventional thinking that, you know, `AIPAC doesn't like this,' or `the Israeli government doesn't like this,' or `the gulf countries don't like it.' It's the possibility of improved relations with adversaries. It's nonproliferation. So all these threads that the president's been spinning--[and in this sense I don't mean it] in the press sense [of spinning, spinning] for almost a decade, they kind of all converged around Iran.'' In the narrative that Rhodes shaped, the ``story'' of the Iran deal began in 2013, when a ``moderate'' faction inside the Iranian regime led by Hassan Rouhani beat a regime of [so-called] ``hardliners'' in an election and then began to pursue a policy of ``openness,'' which included a newfound willingness to negotiate the dismantling of its [so-called] nuclear weapons program. The president set out the timeline himself in his speech announcing the nuclear deal on July 14, 2015, [President Obama]: ``Today, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not.'' While the president's statement was technically accurate--there had in fact been two years of formal negotiations leading up to the signing of the J.C.P.O.A.--it was also actively misleading, because the most meaningful part of the negotiations with Iran [were from mid- 2012] many months before Rouhani and the ``moderate'' camp were chosen in an election among candidates handpicked by Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah. . . . The idea that there was a new reality in Iran was politically useful to the Obama administration. By obtaining broad public currency for the thought that there was a significant split in the regime, and that the administration was reaching out to moderate- minded Iranians who wanted peaceful relations with their neighbors and with America, Obama was [therefore] able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that [the] administration was making. I want to repeat that sentence, by misleading the public on the date on which negotiations began and therefore seizing upon this election that happened a year later, ``Obama was able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that [the] administration was making.'' By eliminating the fuss about Iran's nuclear program, the administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey. With one bold move, the administration would effectively begin the process of a large-scale disengagement from the Middle East. The nerve center for the selling of the Iran deal to Congress, which took place in a concentrated three-month period between July and September of last year, was located inside the White House, and is referred to by its former denizens as ``the war room.'' The White House Office of Legislative Affairs helped run the team, which included three to six people from each of several agencies . . . which were the State Department, Treasury, the American delegation to the United Nations (i.e., Samantha Power), at times . . . the Department of Defense and also the Department of Energy and the National Security Council. Rhodes ``was kind of like the quarterback,'' running the daily video conferences and coming up with lines of attack and parry. ``He was extremely good about immediately getting to a phrase or a way of getting the message out that just made more sense,'' [staff members report]. Framing the deal as a choice between peace and war was Rhodes's go-to move--and proved to be a winning argument. And just to be clear, that wasn't the choice. The choice wasn't between war and peace, and they knew it. They were spinning the public, the press, and the Congress. The person [credited] with running the digital side of the campaign . . . the director of digital response for the White House Office of Digital Strategy, . . . became known in the war room and on Twitter as @TheIranDeal. That is the Twitter handle. Early on, Rhodes asked her to create a rapid-response account that fact-checked everything related to the Iran deal. ``So, we developed a plan that was like: The Iran deal is literally going to be the tip of everything we stand up online,'' [we were told]. ``And we're going to map it onto what we [already] know about the different audiences we're dealing with: the public, pundits, experts, the right wing, Congress.'' By applying 21st century data and networking tools to the white glove world of foreign affairs, the White House was [[Page S2652]] able to track what United States senators and the people who worked for them, and influenced them, were seeing [at different moments] online--and make sure that no potential negative comment passed without a tweet. As she explained how the process worked, I was struck by how naive the assumption of a ``state of nature'' must seem in an information environment that is mediated less and less by experienced editors and reporters with any real prior knowledge of the subjects they write about. ``People construct their own sense of source and credibility now,'' [the staffer told me]. ``They elect whoever they're going to believe.'' For those in need of more traditional-seeming forms of validation, handpicked Beltway insiders like Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor helped retail the administration's narrative. ``Laura Rozen was my RSS feed,'' [the staffer said]. ``She would just find everything and retweet it.'' Rhodes's messaging campaign was so effective not simply because it was a perfectly planned and executed example of digital strategy, but also because he was personally involved in guiding the deal itself. In the interest of time, I am going to skip over a few paragraphs that tell how Jake Sullivan and other administration players traveled to Oman to secretly meet with the Iranians in the summer of 2012. The White House point person during the later stage of the negotiations was Rob Malley, a favored troubleshooter who is currently running negotiations that could keep the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in power. During the course of the Iran talks, Malley told me, he always kept in close contact with Rhodes. ``I would often just call him and say, `Give me a reality check,' '' Malley explained. ``He could say, `Here is where I think the president is, and here is where he will be.' '' He continued, ``Ben would try to anticipate: Does it make sense policywise? But then he would also ask himself: How do we sell it Congress? How do we sell it to the public? What is it going to do to our narrative?'' Malley is a particularly keen observer of the changing art of political communication; his father . . . who was born in Cairo, edited [a] politics magazine . . . and proudly provided a platform for Fidel Castro and Yasir Arafat, in the days when the leaders' words might take [several] weeks to travel from Cuba or Cairo to Paris. ``The Iran experience was the place where I saw firsthand how policy, politics and messaging all had to be brought together, and I think that Ben is really at the intersection of all three. He reflects and he shapes [all three] at the same time.'' As Malley and representatives of the State Department, including Wendy Sherman and Secretary of State John Kerry, engaged in formal negotiations with the Iranians, to ratify details of a framework that had already been agreed upon, Rhodes's war room did its work on Capitol Hill and with reporters. In the spring of last year, legions of arms- control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often- clueless reporters. ``We created an echo chamber,'' he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts [who were] cheerleading for the deal. [He continued:] ``They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.'' When I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America's future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. ``In the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,'' he said. ``We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else [they needed to use]. So we knew the tactics that worked'' [he said]. He is [very] proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. ``We drove them crazy,'' he said of the deal's opponents. Yet Rhodes bridled at the suggestion that there has been anything deceptive about the way the agreement itself was sold. ``Look,'' [he said] ``with Iran, in a weird way, these are state-to-state issues. They're agreements between governments. Yes, I would prefer that it turns out that Rouhani and Zarif . . . are real reformers who are going to be steering this country into the direction I believe it can go in, because their public is educated and, in some respects, pro-American. But we are not betting on [any of] that.'' Do you all remember what we heard last summer when they were testifying before us? We never heard this. We never heard this was the spin, but they didn't actually believe it. But now here, when the guy's thinking about his next step in life, we hear the real story. I will continue. In fact, Rhodes's passion seems to derive not from any investment in the technical specifics of sanctions or centrifuge arrays, or any particular optimism about the future course of Iranian politics and society. Those are matters for the negotiators and area specialists. Rather, it derived from his own sense of urgency of radically reorienting American policy in the Middle East in order to make the prospect of American involvement in the region's future wars a lot less likely. When I asked him whether the prospect of this same kind of far-reaching spin campaign being run by a different administration is something that scares him, he admitted that it does. ``I mean, I'd prefer a sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote. . . . But that's impossible'' [he concluded]. Mr. President, truth is bigger than talking points, and self- government deserves more than spin. Does President Obama think there is such a thing as domestic propaganda? Does he think it is OK? Do we in this Chamber think it is OK? I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 72 (Monday, May 9, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2650-S2652] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE PUBLIC TRUST Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to read into the Record a portion of the New York Times Magazine profile yesterday of Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor to President Obama. Before reading the article, though, titled ``The Story-Teller and the President,'' I wish to explain briefly why I think this piece is so important for us to consider in this Chamber. We live in a time of precipitous change, both in American Government and in communications more broadly. We don't admit it enough in this body, but the Congress in the last decade-plus is extraordinarily weak by historical standards. At the same time, the media is rapidly fragmenting. These two vacuums are being filled by the executive branch in ways that are badly damaging, both to the separation of powers and to the idea of a meaningfully engaged citizenry. There can be little doubt that our Founders would be troubled by what is occurring in our time. Washington is in the process of replacing self-evident truths with self-serving spin, and this is dangerous, for no one is entitled to his or her own facts. I sit intentionally at the desk of Daniel Patrick Moynihan in this body precisely because he was committed to the idea of a shared set of facts before our debates began. Yet this story makes clear that the executive branch feels empowered to proclaim its own narratives. This is bigger than Republicans and Democrats. This is about the legislature's check on the Executive, and it is about all of our accountability in this city to the people. To my Democratic colleagues who supported the Iran deal, does it trouble you at all that the White House displays obvious contempt for you? For your voters and for my voters, will you stand for this kind of fundamentally dishonest spin from future Republican administrations--because I pledge to you that I will not from any administration of either party. Some will say this is just one story of one staffer who wanted to brag and got carried away--someone who wanted to boast about if the whole world could be his canvas, but we should be clear that it is ultimately elected officials who bear responsibility for the ongoing evaporation of public trust in our time. I want to underscore this point. These, my comments tonight, are not about whether you share the President's view that the Iranian nuclear deal was a prudent move or whether you share my view that it was a disaster. That is not the point at issue today. Obviously, foreign policy is critically important, but this story tonight is about whether we take truth seriously. It is about whether we care about the public trust. There is a widespread view around here that our chief job is ``to pass legislation.'' That is incorrect. Our main job, and indeed the oath we took, is to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, which is about limited government and about the separation of powers. Our job is to ensure that the Nation is well governed and that the public can believe that the public can have trust and confidence that the Nation is well governed. This necessarily means that oversight is at least as important as passing or repealing particular pieces of legislation. This horrific story should be a screaming siren to all of us of both parties. Newsrooms are obviously still struggling to understand what vigorous and independent reporting will look like in the digital age, but it remains true that freedom that ordered liberty will remain dependent on an informed citizenry, and that requires a serious and a free press. Good journalism, serious journalism, that takes actual facts seriously and then grapples with those facts honestly, is an important and a high calling. I plan to read about one-fourth of this New York Times piece into the Record, but please note that I will skip over many proper names for ease of audible understanding. Picking up then about 40 percent of the way into the profile, the story continues: The job he [Ben Rhodes] was hired to do, [was] namely to help the President of the United States communicate with the public, [and this job] was changing in equally significant ways, thanks to the impact of digital technologies that people in Washington [[Page S2651]] were just beginning to wrap their minds around. It is hard for many of us to absorb the true magnitude of the changes in the news business--40 percent of newspaper industry professionals have lost their jobs [inside] the last decade-- in part because readers can absorb all [forms of new] news they want from social media platforms like Facebook, which are valued in the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars and pay nothing for the [so-called] ``content'' they provide to their readers. You have to have skin in the game--[that is] to be in the news business, or depend in a life-or-death way on its products--to understand the radical and qualitative ways in which words appear in familiar typefaces [but have yet] been changed. Rhodes [was singling] out a key example to me one day, laced with the brutal contempt that is a hallmark of his private utterances. ``All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,'' he said. ``[But] now they don't. They call us to explain to them what's happening in Moscow [or in] Cairo. [And] most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is [just] 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around [a few] political campaigns. That's a sea change. They literally know nothing.'' In this environment, Rhodes has become adept at ventriloquizing many people at once. Ned Price, Rhodes's assistant, gave me a primer on the way it's done. The easiest way for the White House to shape the news, he explained, is [just] from the briefing podiums, each of which has its own dedicated press corps. ``But then there are [all of these force] multipliers,'' he said, adding, ``We have our compadres, [and I] reach out to a couple [of] people, and you know I wouldn't wanted to name them--'' [I interrupt him and I say] ``I can name them,'' [and I tick] off a few names of prominent Washington reporters and columnists who often tweet in sync with [the] White House['s] messaging [operation]. Price [laughs]. ``I'll say, `Hey, look, some people are spinning this narrative that this is a sign of . . . weakness,' '' he [continues]. [And I interrupt again] ``but--'' ``In fact, it's a sign of strength!'' I [say, chuckling with him]. ``And I'll give them some color,'' Price [continues] ``and the next thing I know, lots of these guys are in the dot-com publishing space, and [they] have [their] huge Twitter followings, and [then] they'll be putting this message [as their own].'' This is something different from old-fashioned spin, which tended to be an art best practiced in person. In a world where experienced reporters competed for scoops and where carrying water for the White House was a cause for shame, no matter which party was in power, it was much harder to sustain a ``narrative'' over any serious period of time. Now the most effectively weaponized 140-character idea or quote will almost always carry the day, and it [will be] very difficult for even good reporters to necessarily know where the spin is coming from or why. When I later visited Obama's former campaign mastermind David Axelrod in Chicago, I brought up the soft Orwellian vibe of an information space where old media structures and hierarchies have been erased by Silicon Valley billionaires who convinced the suckers that information was ``free'' and everyone with access to Google was now a reporter. Axelrod, a former newspaperman, sighed. ``It's not as easy as standing in front of a press conference and speaking to 70 million people like past presidents have been able to do,'' he said. The bully pulpit by and large doesn't exist anymore, he explained. ``So more and more, over the last couple of years, there's been an investment in alternative means of communication: using digital more effectively, going to nontraditional sources, understanding where on each issue your constituencies are going to be found,'' he said. ``I think they've approached these major foreign policy challenges as campaign challenges, and they've run campaigns, and [their] campaigns have been very sophisticated.'' Rhodes's innovative campaign to sell the Iran deal is likely to be a model for how future administrations explain foreign policy to the Congress-- Note that. The administration is going to have to campaign to the Congress-- and the public. The way in which most Americans have heard the story of the Iran deal presented--that the Obama administration began seriously engaging with the Iranian officials in 2013 in order to take advantage of a new political reality in Iran, which came about because of elections that brought [so-called] moderates to power in that country--[this story of 2013] was largely manufactured [``manufactured'' is their verb] for the purpose of selling the deal. Even where the particulars of that story are true, the implications that readers and viewers are encouraged to take away from those particulars are often misleading [and] false. Obama's closest advisers always understood him to be eager [for] a deal with Iran [back in 2012] and even since the beginning of his presidency. ``It's the center of the arc,'' Rhodes explained to me two days after the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was implemented. He then checked off the ways in which the administration's foreign policy aims and priorities converged [in] Iran. ``We don't have to be [in the kind of] cycles of conflict if we can find other ways to resolve these issues,'' he said. ``We can do things that challenge the conventional thinking that, you know, `AIPAC doesn't like this,' or `the Israeli government doesn't like this,' or `the gulf countries don't like it.' It's the possibility of improved relations with adversaries. It's nonproliferation. So all these threads that the president's been spinning--[and in this sense I don't mean it] in the press sense [of spinning, spinning] for almost a decade, they kind of all converged around Iran.'' In the narrative that Rhodes shaped, the ``story'' of the Iran deal began in 2013, when a ``moderate'' faction inside the Iranian regime led by Hassan Rouhani beat a regime of [so-called] ``hardliners'' in an election and then began to pursue a policy of ``openness,'' which included a newfound willingness to negotiate the dismantling of its [so-called] nuclear weapons program. The president set out the timeline himself in his speech announcing the nuclear deal on July 14, 2015, [President Obama]: ``Today, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not.'' While the president's statement was technically accurate--there had in fact been two years of formal negotiations leading up to the signing of the J.C.P.O.A.--it was also actively misleading, because the most meaningful part of the negotiations with Iran [were from mid- 2012] many months before Rouhani and the ``moderate'' camp were chosen in an election among candidates handpicked by Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah. . . . The idea that there was a new reality in Iran was politically useful to the Obama administration. By obtaining broad public currency for the thought that there was a significant split in the regime, and that the administration was reaching out to moderate- minded Iranians who wanted peaceful relations with their neighbors and with America, Obama was [therefore] able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that [the] administration was making. I want to repeat that sentence, by misleading the public on the date on which negotiations began and therefore seizing upon this election that happened a year later, ``Obama was able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that [the] administration was making.'' By eliminating the fuss about Iran's nuclear program, the administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey. With one bold move, the administration would effectively begin the process of a large-scale disengagement from the Middle East. The nerve center for the selling of the Iran deal to Congress, which took place in a concentrated three-month period between July and September of last year, was located inside the White House, and is referred to by its former denizens as ``the war room.'' The White House Office of Legislative Affairs helped run the team, which included three to six people from each of several agencies . . . which were the State Department, Treasury, the American delegation to the United Nations (i.e., Samantha Power), at times . . . the Department of Defense and also the Department of Energy and the National Security Council. Rhodes ``was kind of like the quarterback,'' running the daily video conferences and coming up with lines of attack and parry. ``He was extremely good about immediately getting to a phrase or a way of getting the message out that just made more sense,'' [staff members report]. Framing the deal as a choice between peace and war was Rhodes's go-to move--and proved to be a winning argument. And just to be clear, that wasn't the choice. The choice wasn't between war and peace, and they knew it. They were spinning the public, the press, and the Congress. The person [credited] with running the digital side of the campaign . . . the director of digital response for the White House Office of Digital Strategy, . . . became known in the war room and on Twitter as @TheIranDeal. That is the Twitter handle. Early on, Rhodes asked her to create a rapid-response account that fact-checked everything related to the Iran deal. ``So, we developed a plan that was like: The Iran deal is literally going to be the tip of everything we stand up online,'' [we were told]. ``And we're going to map it onto what we [already] know about the different audiences we're dealing with: the public, pundits, experts, the right wing, Congress.'' By applying 21st century data and networking tools to the white glove world of foreign affairs, the White House was [[Page S2652]] able to track what United States senators and the people who worked for them, and influenced them, were seeing [at different moments] online--and make sure that no potential negative comment passed without a tweet. As she explained how the process worked, I was struck by how naive the assumption of a ``state of nature'' must seem in an information environment that is mediated less and less by experienced editors and reporters with any real prior knowledge of the subjects they write about. ``People construct their own sense of source and credibility now,'' [the staffer told me]. ``They elect whoever they're going to believe.'' For those in need of more traditional-seeming forms of validation, handpicked Beltway insiders like Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor helped retail the administration's narrative. ``Laura Rozen was my RSS feed,'' [the staffer said]. ``She would just find everything and retweet it.'' Rhodes's messaging campaign was so effective not simply because it was a perfectly planned and executed example of digital strategy, but also because he was personally involved in guiding the deal itself. In the interest of time, I am going to skip over a few paragraphs that tell how Jake Sullivan and other administration players traveled to Oman to secretly meet with the Iranians in the summer of 2012. The White House point person during the later stage of the negotiations was Rob Malley, a favored troubleshooter who is currently running negotiations that could keep the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in power. During the course of the Iran talks, Malley told me, he always kept in close contact with Rhodes. ``I would often just call him and say, `Give me a reality check,' '' Malley explained. ``He could say, `Here is where I think the president is, and here is where he will be.' '' He continued, ``Ben would try to anticipate: Does it make sense policywise? But then he would also ask himself: How do we sell it Congress? How do we sell it to the public? What is it going to do to our narrative?'' Malley is a particularly keen observer of the changing art of political communication; his father . . . who was born in Cairo, edited [a] politics magazine . . . and proudly provided a platform for Fidel Castro and Yasir Arafat, in the days when the leaders' words might take [several] weeks to travel from Cuba or Cairo to Paris. ``The Iran experience was the place where I saw firsthand how policy, politics and messaging all had to be brought together, and I think that Ben is really at the intersection of all three. He reflects and he shapes [all three] at the same time.'' As Malley and representatives of the State Department, including Wendy Sherman and Secretary of State John Kerry, engaged in formal negotiations with the Iranians, to ratify details of a framework that had already been agreed upon, Rhodes's war room did its work on Capitol Hill and with reporters. In the spring of last year, legions of arms- control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often- clueless reporters. ``We created an echo chamber,'' he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts [who were] cheerleading for the deal. [He continued:] ``They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.'' When I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America's future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. ``In the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,'' he said. ``We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else [they needed to use]. So we knew the tactics that worked'' [he said]. He is [very] proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. ``We drove them crazy,'' he said of the deal's opponents. Yet Rhodes bridled at the suggestion that there has been anything deceptive about the way the agreement itself was sold. ``Look,'' [he said] ``with Iran, in a weird way, these are state-to-state issues.

The nerve center for the selling of the Iran deal to Congress, which took place in a concentrated three-month period between July and September of last year, was located inside the White House, and is referred to by its former denizens as ``the war room.'' The White House Office of Legislative Affairs helped run the team, which included three to six people from each of several agencies . . . which were the State Department, Treasury, the American delegation to the United Nations (i.e., Samantha Power), at times . . . the Department of Defense and also the Department of Energy and the National Security Council. Rhodes ``was kind of like the quarterback,'' running the daily video conferences and coming up with lines of attack and parry. ``He was extremely good about immediately getting to a phrase or a way of getting the message out that just made more sense,'' [staff members report]. Framing the deal as a choice between peace and war was Rhodes's go-to move--and proved to be a winning argument. And just to be clear, that wasn't the choice. The choice wasn't between war and peace, and they knew it. They were spinning the public, the press, and the Congress. The person [credited] with running the digital side of the campaign . . . the director of digital response for the White House Office of Digital Strategy, . . . became known in the war room and on Twitter as @TheIranDeal. That is the Twitter handle. Early on, Rhodes asked her to create a rapid-response account that fact-checked everything related to the Iran deal. ``So, we developed a plan that was like: The Iran deal is literally going to be the tip of everything we stand up online,'' [we were told]. ``And we're going to map it onto what we [already] know about the different audiences we're dealing with: the public, pundits, experts, the right wing, Congress.'' By applying 21st century data and networking tools to the white glove world of foreign affairs, the White House was [[Page S2652]] able to track what United States senators and the people who worked for them, and influenced them, were seeing [at different moments] online--and make sure that no potential negative comment passed without a tweet. As she explained how the process worked, I was struck by how naive the assumption of a ``state of nature'' must seem in an information environment that is mediated less and less by experienced editors and reporters with any real prior knowledge of the subjects they write about. ``People construct their own sense of source and credibility now,'' [the staffer told me]. ``They elect whoever they're going to believe.'' For those in need of more traditional-seeming forms of validation, handpicked Beltway insiders like Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor helped retail the administration's narrative. ``Laura Rozen was my RSS feed,'' [the staffer said]. ``She would just find everything and retweet it.'' Rhodes's messaging campaign was so effective not simply because it was a perfectly planned and executed example of digital strategy, but also because he was personally involved in guiding the deal itself. In the interest of time, I am going to skip over a few paragraphs that tell how Jake Sullivan and other administration players traveled to Oman to secretly meet with the Iranians in the summer of 2012. The White House point person during the later stage of the negotiations was Rob Malley, a favored troubleshooter who is currently running negotiations that could keep the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in power. During the course of the Iran talks, Malley told me, he always kept in close contact with Rhodes. ``I would often just call him and say, `Give me a reality check,' '' Malley explained. ``He could say, `Here is where I think the president is, and here is where he will be.' '' He continued, ``Ben would try to anticipate: Does it make sense policywise? But then he would also ask himself: How do we sell it Congress? How do we sell it to the public? What is it going to do to our narrative?'' Malley is a particularly keen observer of the changing art of political communication; his father . . . who was born in Cairo, edited [a] politics magazine . . . and proudly provided a platform for Fidel Castro and Yasir Arafat, in the days when the leaders' words might take [several] weeks to travel from Cuba or Cairo to Paris. ``The Iran experience was the place where I saw firsthand how policy, politics and messaging all had to be brought together, and I think that Ben is really at the intersection of all three. He reflects and he shapes [all three] at the same time.'' As Malley and representatives of the State Department, including Wendy Sherman and Secretary of State John Kerry, engaged in formal negotiations with the Iranians, to ratify details of a framework that had already been agreed upon, Rhodes's war room did its work on Capitol Hill and with reporters. In the spring of last year, legions of arms- control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often- clueless reporters. ``We created an echo chamber,'' he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts [who were] cheerleading for the deal. [He continued:] ``They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.'' When I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America's future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. ``In the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,'' he said. ``We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else [they needed to use]. So we knew the tactics that worked'' [he said]. He is [very] proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. ``We drove them crazy,'' he said of the deal's opponents. Yet Rhodes bridled at the suggestion that there has been anything deceptive about the way the agreement itself was sold. ``Look,'' [he said] ``with Iran, in a weird way, these are state-to-state issues. They're agreements between governments. Yes, I would prefer that it turns out that Rouhani and Zarif . . . are real reformers who are going to be steering this country into the direction I believe it can go in, because their public is educated and, in some respects, pro-American. But we are not betting on [any of] that.'' Do you all remember what we heard last summer when they were testifying before us? We never heard this. We never heard this was the spin, but they didn't actually believe it. But now here, when the guy's thinking about his next step in life, we hear the real story. I will continue. In fact, Rhodes's passion seems to derive not from any investment in the technical specifics of sanctions or centrifuge arrays, or any particular optimism about the future course of Iranian politics and society. Those are matters for the negotiators and area specialists. Rather, it derived from his own sense of urgency of radically reorienting American policy in the Middle East in order to make the prospect of American involvement in the region's future wars a lot less likely. When I asked him whether the prospect of this same kind of far-reaching spin campaign being run by a different administration is something that scares him, he admitted that it does. ``I mean, I'd prefer a sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote. . . . But that's impossible'' [he concluded]. Mr. President, truth is bigger than talking points, and self- government deserves more than spin. Does President Obama think there is such a thing as domestic propaganda? Does he think it is OK? Do we in this Chamber think it is OK? I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. ____________________",package_114_174.csv,20648,20648,20712,"[congressional record volume 162, number 72 (monday, may 9, 2016)] [senate] [pages s2650-s2652] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] the public trust mr. sasse. mr. president, i rise this evening to read into the record a portion of the new york times magazine profile yesterday of ben rhodes, deputy national security advisor to president obama. before reading the article, though, titled ``the story-teller and the president,'' i wish to explain briefly why i think this piece is so important for us to consider in this chamber. we live in a time of precipitous change, both in american government and in communications more broadly. we don't admit it enough in this body, but the congress in the last decade-plus is extraordinarily weak by historical standards. at the same time, the media is rapidly fragmenting. these two vacuums are being filled by the executive branch in ways that are badly damaging, both to the separation of powers and to the idea of a meaningfully engaged citizenry. there can be little doubt that our founders would be troubled by what is occurring in our time. washington is in the process of replacing self-evident truths with self-serving spin, and this is dangerous, for no one is entitled to his or her own facts. i sit intentionally at the desk of daniel patrick moynihan in this body precisely because he was committed to the idea of a shared set of facts before our debates began. yet this story makes clear that the executive branch feels empowered to proclaim its own narratives. this is bigger than republicans and democrats. this is about the legislature's check on the executive, and it is about all of our accountability in this city to the people. to my democratic colleagues who supported the iran deal, does it trouble you at all that the white house displays obvious contempt for you? for your voters and for my voters, will you stand for this kind of fundamentally dishonest spin from future republican administrations--because i pledge to you that i will not from any administration of either party. some will say this is just one story of one staffer who wanted to brag and got carried away--someone who wanted to boast about if the whole world could be his canvas, but we should be clear that it is ultimately elected officials who bear responsibility for the ongoing evaporation of public trust in our time. i want to underscore this point. these, my comments tonight, are not about whether you share the president's view that the iranian nuclear deal was a prudent move or whether you share my view that it was a disaster. that is not the point at issue today. obviously, foreign policy is critically important, but this story tonight is about whether we take truth seriously. it is about whether we care about the public trust. there is a widespread view around here that our chief job is ``to pass legislation.'' that is incorrect. our main job, and indeed the oath we took, is to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution, which is about limited government and about the separation of powers. our job is to ensure that the nation is well governed and that the public can believe that the public can have trust and confidence that the nation is well governed. this necessarily means that oversight is at least as important as passing or repealing particular pieces of legislation. this horrific story should be a screaming siren to all of us of both parties. newsrooms are obviously still struggling to understand what vigorous and independent reporting will look like in the digital age, but it remains true that freedom that ordered liberty will remain dependent on an informed citizenry, and that requires a serious and a free press. good journalism, serious journalism, that takes actual facts seriously and then grapples with those facts honestly, is an important and a high calling. i plan to read about one-fourth of this new york times piece into the record, but please note that i will skip over many proper names for ease of audible understanding. picking up then about 40 percent of the way into the profile, the story continues: the job he [ben rhodes] was hired to do, [was] namely to help the president of the united states communicate with the public, [and this job] was changing in equally significant ways, thanks to the impact of digital technologies that people in washington [[page s2651]] were just beginning to wrap their minds around. it is hard for many of us to absorb the true magnitude of the changes in the news business--40 percent of newspaper industry professionals have lost their jobs [inside] the last decade-- in part because readers can absorb all [forms of new] news they want from social media platforms like facebook, which are valued in the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars and pay nothing for the [so-called] ``content'' they provide to their readers. you have to have skin in the game--[that is] to be in the news business, or depend in a life-or-death way on its products--to understand the radical and qualitative ways in which words appear in familiar typefaces [but have yet] been changed. rhodes [was singling] out a key example to me one day, laced with the brutal contempt that is a hallmark of his private utterances. ``all these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,'' he said. ``[but] now they don't. they call us to explain to them what's happening in moscow [or in] cairo. [and] most of the outlets are reporting on world events from washington. the average reporter we talk to is [just] 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around [a few] political campaigns. that's a sea change. they literally know nothing.'' in this environment, rhodes has become adept at ventriloquizing many people at once. ned price, rhodes's assistant, gave me a primer on the way it's done. the easiest way for the white house to shape the news, he explained, is [just] from the briefing podiums, each of which has its own dedicated press corps. ``but then there are [all of these force] multipliers,'' he said, adding, ``we have our compadres, [and i] reach out to a couple [of] people, and you know i wouldn't wanted to name them--'' [i interrupt him and i say] ``i can name them,'' [and i tick] off a few names of prominent washington reporters and columnists who often tweet in sync with [the] white house['s] messaging [operation]. price [laughs]. ``i'll say, `hey, look, some people are spinning this narrative that this is a sign of . . . weakness,' '' he [continues]. [and i interrupt again] ``but--'' ``in fact, it's a sign of strength!'' i [say, chuckling with him]. ``and i'll give them some color,'' price [continues] ``and the next thing i know, lots of these guys are in the dot-com publishing space, and [they] have [their] huge twitter followings, and [then] they'll be putting this message [as their own].'' this is something different from old-fashioned spin, which tended to be an art best practiced in person. in a world where experienced reporters competed for scoops and where carrying water for the white house was a cause for shame, no matter which party was in power, it was much harder to sustain a ``narrative'' over any serious period of time. now the most effectively weaponized 140-character idea or quote will almost always carry the day, and it [will be] very difficult for even good reporters to necessarily know where the spin is coming from or why. when i later visited obama's former campaign mastermind david axelrod in chicago, i brought up the soft orwellian vibe of an information space where old media structures and hierarchies have been erased by silicon valley billionaires who convinced the suckers that information was ``free'' and everyone with access to google was now a reporter. axelrod, a former newspaperman, sighed. ``it's not as easy as standing in front of a press conference and speaking to 70 million people like past presidents have been able to do,'' he said. the bully pulpit by and large doesn't exist anymore, he explained. ``so more and more, over the last couple of years, there's been an investment in alternative means of communication: using digital more effectively, going to nontraditional sources, understanding where on each issue your constituencies are going to be found,'' he said. ``i think they've approached these major foreign policy challenges as campaign challenges, and they've run campaigns, and [their] campaigns have been very sophisticated.'' rhodes's innovative campaign to sell the iran deal is likely to be a model for how future administrations explain foreign policy to the congress-- note that. the administration is going to have to campaign to the congress-- and the public. the way in which most americans have heard the story of the iran deal presented--that the obama administration began seriously engaging with the iranian officials in 2013 in order to take advantage of a new political reality in iran, which came about because of elections that brought [so-called] moderates to power in that country--[this story of 2013] was largely manufactured [``manufactured'' is their verb] for the purpose of selling the deal. even where the particulars of that story are true, the implications that readers and viewers are encouraged to take away from those particulars are often misleading [and] false. obama's closest advisers always understood him to be eager [for] a deal with iran [back in 2012] and even since the beginning of his presidency. ``it's the center of the arc,'' rhodes explained to me two days after the deal, officially known as the joint comprehensive plan of action, was implemented. he then checked off the ways in which the administration's foreign policy aims and priorities converged [in] iran. ``we don't have to be [in the kind of] cycles of conflict if we can find other ways to resolve these issues,'' he said. ``we can do things that challenge the conventional thinking that, you know, `aipac doesn't like this,' or `the israeli government doesn't like this,' or `the gulf countries don't like it.' it's the possibility of improved relations with adversaries. it's nonproliferation. so all these threads that the president's been spinning--[and in this sense i don't mean it] in the press sense [of spinning, spinning] for almost a decade, they kind of all converged around iran.'' in the narrative that rhodes shaped, the ``story'' of the iran deal began in 2013, when a ``moderate'' faction inside the iranian regime led by hassan rouhani beat a regime of [so-called] ``hardliners'' in an election and then began to pursue a policy of ``openness,'' which included a newfound willingness to negotiate the dismantling of its [so-called] nuclear weapons program. the president set out the timeline himself in his speech announcing the nuclear deal on july 14, 2015, [president obama]: ``today, after two years of negotiations, the united states, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not.'' while the president's statement was technically accurate--there had in fact been two years of formal negotiations leading up to the signing of the j.c.p.o.a.--it was also actively misleading, because the most meaningful part of the negotiations with iran [were from mid- 2012] many months before rouhani and the ``moderate'' camp were chosen in an election among candidates handpicked by iran's supreme leader, the ayatollah. . . . the idea that there was a new reality in iran was politically useful to the obama administration. by obtaining broad public currency for the thought that there was a significant split in the regime, and that the administration was reaching out to moderate- minded iranians who wanted peaceful relations with their neighbors and with america, obama was [therefore] able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that [the] administration was making. i want to repeat that sentence, by misleading the public on the date on which negotiations began and therefore seizing upon this election that happened a year later, ``obama was able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that [the] administration was making.'' by eliminating the fuss about iran's nuclear program, the administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for america to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like saudi arabia, egypt, israel and turkey. with one bold move, the administration would

lines of attack and parry. ``he was extremely good about immediately getting to a phrase or a way of getting the message out that just made more sense,'' [staff members report]. framing the deal as a choice between peace and war was rhodes's go-to move--and proved to be a winning argument. and just to be clear, that wasn't the choice. the choice wasn't between war and peace, and they knew it. they
