CREC-2016-05-16-pt1-PgH2389-4,CREC-2016-05-16,114,END HUNGER NOW,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2389-H2390] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] END HUNGER NOW The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, thousands of people will gather in Washington, D.C., this weekend for Feeding the 5000, an event designed to bring awareness to the issue of food waste. Participants will be served a communal meal made entirely out of food that would otherwise have been discarded--in other words, wasted. Since 2009, Feedback, a global environmental organization working to end food waste, has hosted dozens of Feeding the 5000 events in cities across the globe. I am pleased to see so many local partners--including government agencies, charitable organizations, NGOs, industry, and chefs--joining together to call attention to food waste, because the truth of the matter is we will need all of these partners working together to solve the issue of food waste. Last year, the USDA announced their first ever food waste reduction goal, calling for a 50 percent reduction in food waste by 2030. USDA is working with charitable organizations, faith-based groups, and the private sector, and I believe this goal is 100 percent achievable. American consumers, businesses, and farms spend an estimated $218 billion per year growing, processing, transporting, and disposing of food that is never eaten. Up to 40 percent of all food grown is never eaten; 40 to 50 million tons of food is sent to landfills each year, plus another 10 million tons is left unharvested on farms. This food waste translates into approximately 387 billion calories of food that went unconsumed. With 50 million Americans--including 16 million children--struggling with hunger every year, these are startling figures. We know food waste occurs throughout the supply chain, from harvesting to manufacturing, to retail operations and consumer habits. But we must do more to reduce food waste at every stage, recover food that would otherwise have been wasted, and recycle unavoidable waste as animal feed, compost, or energy. Thankfully, there is already a lot of great work being doing to raise awareness about the problem of food waste. Just last week, I attended a screening of the documentary film called ``Just Eat It'' at Amherst Cinema, organized by The Food Bank of Western Massachusetts. ``Just Eat It'' follows a couple, Jen and Grant, as they stop going to the grocery store and live solely off of foods that would have been thrown away. Jen and Grant were able to find an abundance of perfectly safe and healthy food available for consumption that would have been thrown away. It is exciting to see new partnerships forming to study food waste and find ways to use this perfectly good food to reduce hunger in our communities. One such private-public collaboration, ReFED, has brought together over 30 business, government, and NGO leaders committed to wide-scale solutions to U.S. food waste. In March 2016, ReFED released a Roadmap that charts the course for a 20 percent reduction of food waste within a decade. The Roadmap calls for farmers to reduce unharvested food and create secondary markets for imperfect produce. It calls on manufacturers to reduce inefficiencies, make packaging adjustments, and standardize date labeling. It calls on food service companies to further implement waste tracking and incorporate imperfect produce and smaller plates into restaurants. It urges the Federal Government to strengthen tax incentives for food donations and consider standardized date labeling legislation. The good news is that many in the industry are already taking steps to dramatically cut down on wasted food by implementing robust donation programs. For example, Starbucks recently announced it will soon scale up its successful food donation pilot program nationwide. In partnership with the Food Donation Connection and Feeding America, Starbucks will donate unsold food from more than 7,000 company-operated stores--salads, sandwiches, and other refrigerated items--to the Feeding America food bank network. By 2021, that amounts to almost 50 million meals. Our college campuses are also stepping up. Both the Campus Kitchens [[Page H2390]] Project and the Food Recovery Network will work with college dining facilities and students to provide hunger relief in their local communities. In my congressional district, Becker College, Holy Cross College, Smith College, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute all have campus food recovery initiatives. Over the past 35 years, Feeding America has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to ensuring food that would otherwise have been wasted makes its way to food banks across the country and into the homes of families in need. There are dozens of other industry leaders also taking steps to reduce food waste by implementing manufacturing upgrades, maximizing harvests, and utilizing recycling initiatives. I appreciate the efforts of the Food Waste Reduction Alliance in bringing together industry partners to reduce food waste, shrink the environmental footprint, and alleviate hunger in our communities. Reducing food waste is one step we can take toward our goal of ending hunger in the United States and throughout the world. I am pleased to see so many partners at every level of the food supply chain taking action to reduce food waste, but there is still more that needs to be done. Let's solve the problem of food waste, and let's end hunger now. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2389-H2390] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] END HUNGER NOW The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Ramsey Fire Chief Dean Kapler, who recently announced his upcoming retirement. Since 1993, Dean Kapler has been responsible for every aspect of the Ramsey Fire Department, a responsibility that he handles with determination and enthusiasm. Over the past 23 years, Dean has recruited and trained 55 firefighters and maintained three fire stations. Additionally, he has worked tirelessly to provide better coverage and expand fire service for the Ramsey area. The dedication that Dean Kapler has displayed to his home city of 37 years is further proven by the retirement date he has chosen. His retirement will be determined by the completion of the new fire department, a project that he has supervised and insists on seeing through to completion. I want to thank Dean for all the work that he has done for the city of Ramsey, and I wish him happiness in his well-earned retirement. Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant is ``Above and Beyond'' Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Xcel Energy's Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant for receiving the Above and Beyond Award from the U.S. Department of Defense. This award recognizes employers who have gone above and beyond the legal requirements of supporting Guard and Reserve employees, often by giving nonrequired benefits. The role of a Reserve member is critically important to national security, but it is a job with an uncertain future. Thankfully, the Monticello plant fully welcomes the work ethic, leadership, and applied knowledge veterans can bring to a position. Those who serve and sacrifice to keep our Nation safe not only deserve our respect, but also our help when they come home. That is why Xcel's commitment to hire our veterans is so important. I commend the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant for hiring our veterans and for assisting employees who are serving in the Guard or Reserves. Congratulations and thank you to Xcel Energy for your well- deserved award. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Page H2390] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A FIRE CHIEF SAYS GOOD-BYE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Thankfully, the Monticello plant fully welcomes the work ethic, leadership, and applied knowledge veterans can bring to a position. Those who serve and sacrifice to keep our Nation safe not only deserve our respect, but also our help when they come home. That is why Xcel's commitment to hire our veterans is so important. I commend the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant for hiring our veterans and for assisting employees who are serving in the Guard or Reserves. Congratulations and thank you to Xcel Energy for your well- deserved award. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Page H2390] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A FIRE CHIEF SAYS GOOD-BYE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Ramsey Fire Chief Dean Kapler, who recently announced his upcoming retirement. Since 1993, Dean Kapler has been responsible for every aspect of the Ramsey Fire Department, a responsibility that he handles with determination and enthusiasm. Over the past 23 years, Dean has recruited and trained 55 firefighters and maintained three fire stations. Additionally, he has worked tirelessly to provide better coverage and expand fire service for the Ramsey area. The dedication that Dean Kapler has displayed to his home city of 37 years is further proven by the retirement date he has chosen. His retirement will be determined by the completion of the new fire department, a project that he has supervised and insists on seeing through to completion. I want to thank Dean for all the work that he has done for the city of Ramsey, and I wish him happiness in his well-earned retirement. Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant is ``Above and Beyond'' Mr. EMMER of Minnesota.

Lancaster General was the only Pennsylvania health system to be recognized for this honor. Lancaster General was singled out for its work on community programs for the chronically ill, the Amish community, and those dealing with tobacco and obesity issues. Recently, the health system launched a community-led effort called Lighten Up Lancaster that works to increase obesity awareness and weight loss. For the Amish, Lancaster General offered a special free immunization program for children in the rural areas. The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania said Lancaster General Health/Penn Medicine has fully recognized that a relationship with the community is invaluable and key to improving health and wellness.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1492) to direct the Administrator of General Services, on behalf of the Archivist of the United States, to convey certain Federal property located in the State of Alaska to the Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 1492 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. REAL PROPERTY CONVEYANCE. (a) Definitions.--In this section: (1) Archivist.--The term ``Archivist'' means the Archivist of the United States. (2) City.--The term ``City'' means the Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska. (b) Conveyance.-- (1) In general.--As soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this Act and after completion of the survey and appraisal described in this section, the Administrator of General Services, on behalf of the Archivist, shall offer to convey to the City by quitclaim deed for the consideration and under the conditions described in subsection (d), all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to a parcel of real property described in subsection (c). (2) Costs of conveyance.--The City shall be responsible for paying-- (A) the costs of an appraisal conducted pursuant to subsection (d)(1)(B); and (B) any other costs relating to the conveyance of the Federal property under this Act. (c) Legal Description of Property.-- (1) In general.--The parcel to be conveyed under subsection (b) consists of approximately 9 acres and improvements located at 400 East Fortieth Avenue in the City that is administered by the National Archives and Records Administration. (2) Survey required.--As soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this Act, the exact acreage and legal description of the real property to be conveyed under subsection (b) shall be determined by a survey, paid for by the City, that is satisfactory to the Archivist. (d) Terms and Conditions.-- (1) Consideration.-- (A) In general.--As consideration for the conveyance of the property under subsection (b), the City shall pay to the Archivist an amount not less than the fair market value of the conveyed property, to be determined as provided in subparagraph (B). (B) Appraisal.--The fair market value of the property to be conveyed under subsection (b) shall be determined based on an appraisal that-- (i) is conducted by a licensed, independent appraiser that is approved by the Archivist and the City; (ii) is based on the highest and best use of the property; (iii) is approved by the Archivist; and (iv) is paid for by the City. (2) Preconveyance entry.--The Archivist, on terms and conditions the Archivist determines to be appropriate, may authorize the City to enter the property at no charge for preconstruction and construction activities. (3) Additional terms and conditions.--The Archivist may require additional terms and conditions in connection with the conveyance under subsection (b) as the Archivist considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United States. (e) Proceeds.--Any net proceeds received by the Archivist as a result of the conveyance under this Act shall be deposited in the Treasury and used for deficit reduction, in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury considers appropriate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska. General Leave Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on S. 1492. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alaska? There was no objection. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. For the record, this is the same bill that has passed this House twice unanimously. It was over in the Senate, and they sent it back to us. It is a very simple bill that would direct the General Services Administration, on behalf of the National Archives, to convey property to Alaska, to the city of Anchorage. I am pleased that the sponsor of the House companion bill, as I mentioned before, has been passed by the House twice and has now been sent back to my senator, Senator Dan Sullivan. The National Archives has determined that it no longer needs the property and wants to sell it as part of its efforts to shrink its real estate footprint and reduce the costs to the taxpayer. The bill will require fair market value for the property based on an independent appraisal. The proceeds will be deposited into the Treasury and will be used for deficit reduction. This bill is in line with what we have been urging all Federal agencies to do--consolidate and reduce their space and sell unneeded properties. The municipality of Anchorage requested this land be made available, and the city council passed a resolution that thanks the delegation for supporting this legislation. I am very excited to get this land into the hands of the municipality of Anchorage for development purposes. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I support S. 1492, which directs the GSA, on behalf of the Archivist of the United States, to convey 9 acres of property in Anchorage, Alaska, to the local municipality in exchange for its fair market value. The GSA and the Archivist of the United States have come to the conclusion that this property is underutilized and is no longer needed by the Federal Government. A House version of this bill was reported out of committee by a voice vote and was subsequently passed by the House. Selling this property to the city of Anchorage, Alaska, at its fair market value protects the interests of taxpayers who acquired the property. It also allows the Federal Government to shed the costs of maintaining and securing an unneeded property. Finally, I encourage the GSA to continue using its existing authority and expertise to identify and dispose of other pieces of underutilized Federal real estate as appropriate. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I urge its passage. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1492. [[Page H2392]] The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

(e) proceeds.--any net proceeds received by the archivist as a result of the conveyance under this act shall be deposited in the treasury and used for deficit reduction, in such manner as the secretary of the treasury considers appropriate. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from alaska (mr. young) and the gentleman from indiana (mr. carson) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from alaska. general leave mr. young of alaska. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on s. 1492. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from alaska? there was no objection. mr. young of alaska. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. for the record, this is the same bill that has passed this house twice unanimously. it was over in the senate, and they sent it back to us. it is a very simple bill that would direct the general services administration, on behalf of the national archives, to convey property to alaska, to the city of anchorage. i am pleased that the sponsor of the house companion bill, as i mentioned before, has been passed by the house twice and has now been sent back to my senator, senator dan sullivan. the national archives has determined that it no longer needs the property and wants to sell it as part of its efforts to shrink its real estate footprint and reduce the costs to the taxpayer. the bill will require fair market value for the property based on an independent appraisal. the proceeds will be deposited into the treasury and will be used for deficit reduction. this bill is in line with what we have been urging all federal agencies to do--consolidate and reduce their space and sell unneeded properties. the municipality of anchorage requested this land be made available, and the city council passed a resolution that thanks the delegation for supporting this legislation. i am very excited to get this land into the hands of the municipality of anchorage for development purposes. i urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. carson of indiana. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i support s. 1492, which directs the gsa, on behalf of the archivist of the united states, to convey 9 acres of property in anchorage, alaska, to the local municipality in exchange for its fair market value. the gsa and the archivist of the united states have come to the conclusion that this property is underutilized and is no longer needed by the federal government. a house version of this bill was reported out of committee by a voice vote and was subsequently passed by the house. selling this property to the city of anchorage, alaska, at its fair market value protects the interests of taxpayers who acquired the property. it also allows the federal government to shed the costs of maintaining and securing an unneeded property. finally, i encourage the gsa to continue using its existing authority and expertise to identify and dispose of other pieces of underutilized federal real estate as appropriate. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. young of alaska. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and i urge its passage. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from alaska (mr. young) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, s. 1492. [[page h2392]] the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",7210

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within [[Page H2393]] which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 3832, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise to urge approval of H.R. 3832, the Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act of 2016. I introduced this bipartisan legislation with my friend and colleague, Mr. Lewis, to combat tax-related identity theft. On a personal note, it has been an honor to work with Mr. Lewis. He paid me a great compliment when he said I ``rained passion and truth'' on the important issue of identity theft. Truthfully, since Congressman Lewis was first elected, he has been a legislator who has brought great passion and truth to every endeavor of his storied career. I truly thank him for working with me on this legislation. Tax-related identity theft is an evolving criminal activity that targets innocent taxpayers nationwide and robs the Treasury of billions of dollars each year. I was grateful for the opportunity last month to testify before the Committee on Ways and Means about my experience with tax-related ID theft. Last year, my personal information was stolen, and someone used that information to electronically file a fraudulent tax return for my wife and me. That return, which included a fraudulent W-2 from the House of Representatives, claimed a significant refund, with the proceeds directed to a bank account outside the U.S. So when it comes to ID theft, I truly understand the impact that it has on taxpayers in northeast Ohio and across the country. I am committed to cracking down on the growing threat, and this bipartisan bill is an important first step forward. I was pleased that two core components from this bill were included in the PATH Act that passed last December. The remaining components of this bill will help further shield taxpayer dollars from thieves and reduce the hardships that are caused by this criminal activity. They include establishing a centralized point of contact at the IRS for ID theft victims. This will make it easier for victims to resolve their ID theft tax cases and ensure a unit at the IRS is held accountable for handling a taxpayer's case from start to finish. Another one would improve the taxpayer notification of suspected ID theft. When the IRS determines there has been the unauthorized use of a taxpayer's identity, the IRS would be required--as soon as practicable and without jeopardizing an investigation--to notify the taxpayer and give instructions to the taxpayer about filing a police report. The last one I will mention would require the IRS to submit a study on the feasibility of establishing a program for ID theft victims to be able to opt out of electronic filing. This provision would require the IRS to report back to Congress within 180 days on this issue. I also thank my friend, Mr. Pascrell, for his work on this issue and for his amendments that were incorporated into the bill during this markup last month. Mr. Speaker, tax-related identity theft is one of the most pressing challenges that we face in the world of tax administration. This complex and evolving threat requires cooperation from Congress, the IRS, State revenue agencies, and industry stakeholders. While I am aware that not every tax-related ID theft problem is best served with a congressional solution, this legislation is an important first step in fighting ID theft and in better protecting victims. I urge all Members to support this bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC, May 13, 2016. Hon. Kevin Brady, Chairman, Committee on Ways & Means, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Brady: I am writing with respect to H.R. 3832, the ``Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act,'' which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary. As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 3832 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to discharge our committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 3832 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 3832, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 3832. Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC, May 16, 2016. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 3832, the ``Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act of 2016.'' As you noted, the Committee on the Judiciary was granted an additional referral of the bill. I am most appreciative of your decision to waive formal consideration of H.R. 3832 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that although you waived formal consideration of the bill, the Committee on the Judiciary is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill that fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate conference involving this legislation. I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional Record during consideration of this legislation on the House floor. Sincerely, Kevin Brady, Chairman. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I commend my friend from Ohio (Mr. Renacci) for his work on this bill. As he knows, I have been interested in this issue of tax fraud and identity theft for some time. I am pleased that the bill we are marking up today, H.R. 3832, includes many provisions included in the bill that I put forth, H.R. 3981, the Identity Theft and Tax Fraud Prevention Act. These provisions include having a central point of contact for a victim of identity theft and taxpayer notification of suspected identity theft. In addition, two of my amendments were included in the bill. The first would create a local law enforcement liaison within the Criminal Investigation Division of the IRS. Our police and law enforcement officers are out every day, keeping our communities safe and tracking down criminals. Too often, coordinating their efforts with the IRS when it comes to identity theft is not as easy as it should be. My amendment helps law enforcement officers do their jobs by creating a local law enforcement liaison at the IRS. This position will be tasked with sharing information and responding to local law enforcement when they have information or inquiries about identity theft cases. It is common sense, and it will make it easier for police officers to go to a single place at the IRS when they want to work a case. The second amendment included in this bill deals with the IRS phone scam, and this is growing by the day. Imagine sitting at home when you receive a call from a threatening voice on the other end of the line that claims to be the IRS. For too many Americans, this experience is all too familiar. These criminals may ask unsuspecting citizens for their personal information, for their Social Security numbers, or even for bank account information--that has been done; it is very common-- and will threaten them with arrest or other penalties if the listeners don't comply. These phone scams have become increasingly aggressive and harmful to taxpayers. My amendment addresses this problem in practical ways. First, it requires the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration to issue a report that identifies potential technological solutions to the phone scam. [[Page H2394]] Second, it would have the IRS provide information to callers who may be put on hold, when calling in, regarding common identity theft tax scams and how to avoid them. We need to do all we can to make sure taxpayers are informed and armed against these scams. Identity theft and tax fraud is a growing problem in the United States of America. As technology changes and as criminal syndicates target American citizens' tax returns, we have an obligation to address the issue. This bill does not go quite as far as I would have liked, and I urge my colleagues to take a look at H.R. 3981. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of Congressman John Lewis' bill, the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2016, which takes additional steps to increase funding for taxpayer services and to end the use of private debt collectors. This bill is a step in the right direction. I congratulate its sponsor as it is a good example of how we can work together across the aisle and find commonsense solutions for the American people. I hope this is a harbinger of things to come. Who knows? I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 3832. Mr. Renacci and I are very good friends, as I am with Mr. Lewis, and it is good to see Mr. Pascrell here today. The gentleman is right in that it is nice to see us working together to do something about people. This is about people. This is policy that concerns people, and it works in the right direction. I don't think there is anything quite as unnerving as finding out that somebody has stolen your identity. I think Shakespeare sums it up right in Othello by putting it really succinctly when he says: ``But he that filches from me my good name, robs me of that which not enriches him, and makes me poor indeed.'' {time} 1615 Now, Pennsylvania is sixth in population but second when it comes to fraud, tax fraud. This is incredible that this could happen. As we sit here today--and as Mr. Pascrell so clearly pointed out, and Mr. Renacci--this is about protecting people from people who wish to do them harm. They not only wish to take their tax returns, but it robs them of their identity. There is nothing that could be more chilling than losing your identity. As we look at how this goes forward--and I think that this phone fraud is the one that is particularly interesting. When the IRS calls on you, it is not on the phone. It is in writing. And I tell constituents all the time, I also have received those calls saying that: Hey, you know what? You need to get in touch with us right now. We can handle this over the phone with you. I said: Fine. You know what? Leave your name and number, and I will get back to you because I am really busy right now. That is followed by a very quick click. There is so much going on in our world today. We are so vulnerable at every single turn. We put so much information out there on ourselves. This is a piece of legislation that protects people. It protects not only their returns, but protects their identity. So I am glad that Mr. Renacci has done this with Mr. Lewis and my good friend Mr. Pascrell. We stand here today with the same purpose, and that is to protect the people who sent us here to represent them. It is the least we can do. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to quickly say that what is really happening out there is that many seniors are being preyed upon. When you get a threatening phone call, you don't know what to think. And when you are up there in age, as some of us are, Mr. Kelly, you don't know what to expect, and you don't know who to turn to. So this is very important, what Mr. Renacci is putting forth right now. I just want everyone to understand that. It has good bipartisan support, and I hope that we can move this very, very quickly. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reed). Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--Mr. Pascrell, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Renacci, and Mr. Kelly--in a common refrain. What Mr. Renacci, Mr. Lewis, and Mr. Pascrell have identified here is something we have been working on in the committee for quite some time, and that is to make sure that we have a tax administration and a Tax Code that respects the privacy of individuals. When that privacy is violated--I cannot speak like my colleague from Pennsylvania and quote Shakespeare, as I am a simple country lawyer from western New York--simply, what we need to do is to stand on the side of our taxpayers. When tax fraud occurs, real people suffer as a result of it. What Mr. Renacci and all of us have come together here to support are simple, commonsense reforms that are going to help people out like Terry. Terry is from Hornell in my district. He reached out to us, Mr. Speaker, about 1\1/2\ years to 2 years ago. He, too, was the victim of identity fraud and identity theft. When he went to file his return, he found out that he would not be getting that refund because someone had already stolen that money from the U.S. Government. Terry relied on that money, Mr. Speaker. He needed that money. After many phone calls, after many efforts from our office, we were able to work it out and get that taken care of for Terry. Terry is representative of millions of Americans who have found themselves in this situation, just like Mr. Renacci did. So I applaud Mr. Renacci for developing these commonsense reforms that are going to give a point of contact at the IRS, that are going to make sure when people engage in identity theft in the tax arena that there are real penalties and consequences to that behavior. I strongly support this legislation, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my colleagues, just as has been demonstrated here today, to come together as we care deeply about the American taxpayer and stand for them as the victims of this crime. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I again want to thank my colleague, Mr. Lewis, for his work with me and this legislation. I also truly want to thank Mr. Pascrell. As he said, I hope it is a sign of things to come, where we can work together on important issues that face the American people. I urge all Members to support H.R. 3832, the Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act of 2016. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3832, the Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act of 2016, as amended. While I support the legislation's underlying goal of deterring and preventing tax-related identity theft and tax fraud, I strongly oppose the bill's expansion of mandatory minimum sentencing. Section 5 of the bill would expand the mandatory minimums found in Title 18 Section 1028A of the United States Code. This section of Title 18 imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of two years for ``aggravated identity theft.'' Under section 5 of this bill, a violation of section 7206(b) of the Internal Revenue Code would require a judge to impose a two year mandatory minimum regardless of the circumstances of the case. While a two year sentence may be appropriate for most individuals convicted under this bill, it should be left to the discretion of the sentencing judge to determine the exact sentence based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. Research and evidence in the past few decades has demonstrated that mandatory minimums are ineffective deterrents, waste the taxpayers' money, force judges to impose irrational sentences, and discriminate against minorities, particularly with regards to drug offenses. Unfortunately, there are too many mandatory minimums in the federal code. Mr. Speaker, if we expect to do anything about that problem, the first step has to be to stop passing new ones. The mandatory minimums in the code today did not get there all at once--they got there one at a time, each one part of a larger bill, which on balance might have been a good idea. Therefore, the only way to stop passing new mandatory minimums is to stop passing bills that contain mandatory minimums. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote No on H.R. 3832. [[Page H2395]] The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3832, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2392-H2395] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STOLEN IDENTITY REFUND FRAUD PREVENTION ACT OF 2016 Mr. RENACCI.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within [[Page H2393]] which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 3832, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise to urge approval of H.R. 3832, the Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act of 2016. I introduced this bipartisan legislation with my friend and colleague, Mr. Lewis, to combat tax-related identity theft. On a personal note, it has been an honor to work with Mr. Lewis. He paid me a great compliment when he said I ``rained passion and truth'' on the important issue of identity theft. Truthfully, since Congressman Lewis was first elected, he has been a legislator who has brought great passion and truth to every endeavor of his storied career. I truly thank him for working with me on this legislation. Tax-related identity theft is an evolving criminal activity that targets innocent taxpayers nationwide and robs the Treasury of billions of dollars each year. I was grateful for the opportunity last month to testify before the Committee on Ways and Means about my experience with tax-related ID theft. Last year, my personal information was stolen, and someone used that information to electronically file a fraudulent tax return for my wife and me. That return, which included a fraudulent W-2 from the House of Representatives, claimed a significant refund, with the proceeds directed to a bank account outside the U.S. So when it comes to ID theft, I truly understand the impact that it has on taxpayers in northeast Ohio and across the country. I am committed to cracking down on the growing threat, and this bipartisan bill is an important first step forward. I was pleased that two core components from this bill were included in the PATH Act that passed last December. The remaining components of this bill will help further shield taxpayer dollars from thieves and reduce the hardships that are caused by this criminal activity. They include establishing a centralized point of contact at the IRS for ID theft victims. This will make it easier for victims to resolve their ID theft tax cases and ensure a unit at the IRS is held accountable for handling a taxpayer's case from start to finish. Another one would improve the taxpayer notification of suspected ID theft. When the IRS determines there has been the unauthorized use of a taxpayer's identity, the IRS would be required--as soon as practicable and without jeopardizing an investigation--to notify the taxpayer and give instructions to the taxpayer about filing a police report. The last one I will mention would require the IRS to submit a study on the feasibility of establishing a program for ID theft victims to be able to opt out of electronic filing. This provision would require the IRS to report back to Congress within 180 days on this issue. I also thank my friend, Mr. Pascrell, for his work on this issue and for his amendments that were incorporated into the bill during this markup last month. Mr. Speaker, tax-related identity theft is one of the most pressing challenges that we face in the world of tax administration. This complex and evolving threat requires cooperation from Congress, the IRS, State revenue agencies, and industry stakeholders. While I am aware that not every tax-related ID theft problem is best served with a congressional solution, this legislation is an important first step in fighting ID theft and in better protecting victims. I urge all Members to support this bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC, May 13, 2016. Hon. Kevin Brady, Chairman, Committee on Ways & Means, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Brady: I am writing with respect to H.R. 3832, the ``Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act,'' which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary. As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 3832 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to discharge our committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 3832 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 3832, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 3832. Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC, May 16, 2016. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 3832, the ``Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act of 2016.'' As you noted, the Committee on the Judiciary was granted an additional referral of the bill. I am most appreciative of your decision to waive formal consideration of H.R. 3832 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that although you waived formal consideration of the bill, the Committee on the Judiciary is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill that fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate conference involving this legislation. I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional Record during consideration of this legislation on the House floor. Sincerely, Kevin Brady, Chairman. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I commend my friend from Ohio (Mr. Renacci) for his work on this bill. As he knows, I have been interested in this issue of tax fraud and identity theft for some time. I am pleased that the bill we are marking up today, H.R. 3832, includes many provisions included in the bill that I put forth, H.R. 3981, the Identity Theft and Tax Fraud Prevention Act. These provisions include having a central point of contact for a victim of identity theft and taxpayer notification of suspected identity theft. In addition, two of my amendments were included in the bill. The first would create a local law enforcement liaison within the Criminal Investigation Division of the IRS. Our police and law enforcement officers are out every day, keeping our communities safe and tracking down criminals. Too often, coordinating their efforts with the IRS when it comes to identity theft is not as easy as it should be. My amendment helps law enforcement officers do their jobs by creating a local law enforcement liaison at the IRS. This position will be tasked with sharing information and responding to local law enforcement when they have information or inquiries about identity theft cases. It is common sense, and it will make it easier for police officers to go to a single place at the IRS when they want to work a case. The second amendment included in this bill deals with the IRS phone scam, and this is growing by the day. Imagine sitting at home when you receive a call from a threatening voice on the other end of the line that claims to be the IRS. For too many Americans, this experience is all too familiar. These criminals may ask unsuspecting citizens for their personal information, for their Social Security numbers, or even for bank account information--that has been done; it is very common-- and will threaten them with arrest or other penalties if the listeners don't comply. These phone scams have become increasingly aggressive and harmful to taxpayers. My amendment addresses this problem in practical ways. First, it requires the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration to issue a report that identifies potential technological solutions to the phone scam. [[Page H2394]] Second, it would have the IRS provide information to callers who may be put on hold, when calling in, regarding common identity theft tax scams and how to avoid them. We need to do all we can to make sure taxpayers are informed and armed against these scams. Identity theft and tax fraud is a growing problem in the United States of America. As technology changes and as criminal syndicates target American citizens' tax returns, we have an obligation to address the issue. This bill does not go quite as far as I would have liked, and I urge my colleagues to take a look at H.R. 3981. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of Congressman John Lewis' bill, the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2016, which takes additional steps to increase funding for taxpayer services and to end the use of private debt collectors. This bill is a step in the right direction. I congratulate its sponsor as it is a good example of how we can work together across the aisle and find commonsense solutions for the American people. I hope this is a harbinger of things to come. Who knows? I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 3832. Mr. Renacci and I are very good friends, as I am with Mr. Lewis, and it is good to see Mr. Pascrell here today. The gentleman is right in that it is nice to see us working together to do something about people. This is about people. This is policy that concerns people, and it works in the right direction. I don't think there is anything quite as unnerving as finding out that somebody has stolen your identity. I think Shakespeare sums it up right in Othello by putting it really succinctly when he says: ``But he that filches from me my good name, robs me of that which not enriches him, and makes me poor indeed.'' {time} 1615 Now, Pennsylvania is sixth in population but second when it comes to fraud, tax fraud. This is incredible that this could happen. As we sit here today--and as Mr. Pascrell so clearly pointed out, and Mr. Renacci--this is about protecting people from people who wish to do them harm. They not only wish to take their tax returns, but it robs them of their identity. There is nothing that could be more chilling than losing your identity. As we look at how this goes forward--and I think that this phone fraud is the one that is particularly interesting. When the IRS calls on you, it is not on the phone. It is in writing. And I tell constituents all the time, I also have received those calls saying that: Hey, you know what? You need to get in touch with us right now. We can handle this over the phone with you. I said: Fine. You know what? Leave your name and number, and I will get back to you because I am really busy right now. That is followed by a very quick click. There is so much going on in our world today. We are so vulnerable at every single turn. We put so much information out there on ourselves. This is a piece of legislation that protects people. It protects not only their returns, but protects their identity. So I am glad that Mr. Renacci has done this with Mr. Lewis and my good friend Mr. Pascrell. We stand here today with the same purpose, and that is to protect the people who sent us here to represent them. It is the least we can do. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to quickly say that what is really happening out there is that many seniors are being preyed upon. When you get a threatening phone call, you don't know what to think. And when you are up there in age, as some of us are, Mr. Kelly, you don't know what to expect, and you don't know who to turn to. So this is very important, what Mr. Renacci is putting forth right now. I just want everyone to understand that. It has good bipartisan support, and I hope that we can move this very, very quickly. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reed). Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--Mr. Pascrell, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Renacci, and Mr. Kelly--in a common refrain. What Mr. Renacci, Mr. Lewis, and Mr. Pascrell have identified here is something we have been working on in the committee for quite some time, and that is to make sure that we have a tax administration and a Tax Code that respects the privacy of individuals. When that privacy is violated--I cannot speak like my colleague from Pennsylvania and quote Shakespeare, as I am a simple country lawyer from western New York--simply, what we need to do is to stand on the side of our taxpayers. When tax fraud occurs, real people suffer as a result of it. What Mr. Renacci and all of us have come together here to support are simple, commonsense reforms that are going to help people out like Terry. Terry is from Hornell in my district. He reached out to us, Mr. Speaker, about 1\1/2\ years to 2 years ago. He, too, was the victim of identity fraud and identity theft. When he went to file his return, he found out that he would not be getting that refund because someone had already stolen that money from the U.S. Government. Terry relied on that money, Mr. Speaker. He needed that money. After many phone calls, after many efforts from our office, we were able to work it out and get that taken care of for Terry. Terry is representative of millions of Americans who have found themselves in this situation, just like Mr. Renacci did. So I applaud Mr. Renacci for developing these commonsense reforms that are going to give a point of contact at the IRS, that are going to make sure when people engage in identity theft in the tax arena that there are real penalties and consequences to that behavior. I strongly support this legislation, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my colleagues, just as has been demonstrated here today, to come together as we care deeply about the American taxpayer and stand for them as the victims of this crime. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I again want to thank my colleague, Mr. Lewis, for his work with me and this legislation. I also truly want to thank Mr. Pascrell. As he said, I hope it is a sign of things to come, where we can work together on important issues that face the American people. I urge all Members to support H.R. 3832, the Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act of 2016. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3832, the Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act of 2016, as amended. While I support the legislation's underlying goal of deterring and preventing tax-related identity theft and tax fraud, I strongly oppose the bill's expansion of mandatory minimum sentencing. Section 5 of the bill would expand the mandatory minimums found in Title 18 Section 1028A of the United States Code. This section of Title 18 imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of two years for ``aggravated identity theft.'' Under section 5 of this bill, a violation of section 7206(b) of the Internal Revenue Code would require a judge to impose a two year mandatory minimum regardless of the circumstances of the case. While a two year sentence may be appropriate for most individuals convicted under this bill, it should be left to the discretion of the sentencing judge to determine the exact sentence based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. Research and evidence in the past few decades has demonstrated that mandatory minimums are ineffective deterrents, waste the taxpayers' money, force judges to impose irrational sentences, and discriminate against minorities, particularly with regards to drug offenses. Unfortunately, there are too many mandatory minimums in the federal code. Mr. Speaker, if we expect to do anything about that problem, the first step has to be to stop passing new ones. The mandatory minimums in the code today did not get there all at once--they got there one at a time, each one part of a larger bill, which on balance might have been a good idea. Therefore, the only way to stop passing new mandatory minimums is to stop passing bills that contain mandatory minimums. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote No on H.R. 3832. [[Page H2395]] The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3832, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2392-H2395] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STOLEN IDENTITY REFUND FRAUD PREVENTION ACT OF 2016 Mr. RENACCI.

I acknowledge that although you waived formal consideration of the bill, the Committee on the Judiciary is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill that fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate conference involving this legislation. I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional Record during consideration of this legislation on the House floor. Sincerely, Kevin Brady, Chairman. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I commend my friend from Ohio (Mr. Renacci) for his work on this bill. As he knows, I have been interested in this issue of tax fraud and identity theft for some time. I am pleased that the bill we are marking up today, H.R. 3832, includes many provisions included in the bill that I put forth, H.R. 3981, the Identity Theft and Tax Fraud Prevention Act. These provisions include having a central point of contact for a victim of identity theft and taxpayer notification of suspected identity theft. In addition, two of my amendments were included in the bill. The first would create a local law enforcement liaison within the Criminal Investigation Division of the IRS. Our police and law enforcement officers are out every day, keeping our communities safe and tracking down criminals. Too often, coordinating their efforts with the IRS when it comes to identity theft is not as easy as it should be. My amendment helps law enforcement officers do their jobs by creating a local law enforcement liaison at the IRS. This position will be tasked with sharing information and responding to local law enforcement when they have information or inquiries about identity theft cases. It is common sense, and it will make it easier for police officers to go to a single place at the IRS when they want to work a case. The second amendment included in this bill deals with the IRS phone scam, and this is growing by the day. Imagine sitting at home when you receive a call from a threatening voice on the other end of the line that claims to be the IRS. For too many Americans, this experience is all too familiar. These criminals may ask unsuspecting citizens for their personal information, for their Social Security numbers, or even for bank account information--that has been done; it is very common-- and will threaten them with arrest or other penalties if the listeners don't comply. These phone scams have become increasingly aggressive and harmful to taxpayers. My amendment addresses this problem in practical ways. First, it requires the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration to issue a report that identifies potential technological solutions to the phone scam. [[Page H2394]] Second, it would have the IRS provide information to callers who may be put on hold, when calling in, regarding common identity theft tax scams and how to avoid them. We need to do all we can to make sure taxpayers are informed and armed against these scams. Identity theft and tax fraud is a growing problem in the United States of America. As technology changes and as criminal syndicates target American citizens' tax returns, we have an obligation to address the issue. This bill does not go quite as far as I would have liked, and I urge my colleagues to take a look at H.R. 3981. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of Congressman John Lewis' bill, the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2016, which takes additional steps to increase funding for taxpayer services and to end the use of private debt collectors. This bill is a step in the right direction. I congratulate its sponsor as it is a good example of how we can work together across the aisle and find commonsense solutions for the American people. I hope this is a harbinger of things to come. Who knows? I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 3832. Mr. Renacci and I are very good friends, as I am with Mr. Lewis, and it is good to see Mr. Pascrell here today. The gentleman is right in that it is nice to see us working together to do something about people. This is about people. This is policy that concerns people, and it works in the right direction. I don't think there is anything quite as unnerving as finding out that somebody has stolen your identity. I think Shakespeare sums it up right in Othello by putting it really succinctly when he says: ``But he that filches from me my good name, robs me of that which not enriches him, and makes me poor indeed.'' {time} 1615 Now, Pennsylvania is sixth in population but second when it comes to fraud, tax fraud. This is incredible that this could happen. As we sit here today--and as Mr. Pascrell so clearly pointed out, and Mr. Renacci--this is about protecting people from people who wish to do them harm. They not only wish to take their tax returns, but it robs them of their identity. There is nothing that could be more chilling than losing your identity. As we look at how this goes forward--and I think that this phone fraud is the one that is particularly interesting. When the IRS calls on you, it is not on the phone. It is in writing. And I tell constituents all the time, I also have received those calls saying that: Hey, you know what? You need to get in touch with us right now. We can handle this over the phone with you. I said: Fine. You know what? Leave your name and number, and I will get back to you because I am really busy right now. That is followed by a very quick click. There is so much going on in our world today. We are so vulnerable at every single turn. We put so much information out there on ourselves. This is a piece of legislation that protects people. It protects not only their returns, but protects their identity. So I am glad that Mr. Renacci has done this with Mr. Lewis and my good friend Mr. Pascrell. We stand here today with the same purpose, and that is to protect the people who sent us here to represent them. It is the least we can do. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to quickly say that what is really happening out there is that many seniors are being preyed upon. When you get a threatening phone call, you don't know what to think. And when you are up there in age, as some of us are, Mr. Kelly, you don't know what to expect, and you don't know who to turn to. So this is very important, what Mr. Renacci is putting forth right now. I just want everyone to understand that. It has good bipartisan support, and I hope that we can move this very, very quickly. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reed). Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--Mr. Pascrell, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Renacci, and Mr. Kelly--in a common refrain. What Mr. Renacci, Mr. Lewis, and Mr. Pascrell have identified here is something we have been working on in the committee for quite some time, and that is to make sure that we have a tax administration and a Tax Code that respects the privacy of individuals. When that privacy is violated--I cannot speak like my colleague from Pennsylvania and quote Shakespeare, as I am a simple country lawyer from western New York--simply, what we need to do is to stand on the side of our taxpayers. When tax fraud occurs, real people suffer as a result of it. What Mr. Renacci and all of us have come together here to support are simple, commonsense reforms that are going to help people out like Terry. Terry is from Hornell in my district. He reached out to us, Mr. Speaker, about 1\1/2\ years to 2 years ago. He, too, was the victim of identity fraud and identity theft. When he went to file his return, he found out that he would not be getting that refund because someone had already stolen that money from the U.S. Government. Terry relied on that money, Mr. Speaker. He needed that money. After many phone calls, after many efforts from our office, we were able to work it out and get that taken care of for Terry. Terry is representative of millions of Americans who have found themselves in this situation, just like Mr. Renacci did. So I applaud Mr. Renacci for developing these commonsense reforms that are going to give a point of contact at the IRS, that are going to make sure when people engage in identity theft in the tax arena that there are real penalties and consequences to that behavior. I strongly support this legislation, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my colleagues, just as has been demonstrated here today, to come together as we care deeply about the American taxpayer and stand for them as the victims of this crime. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I again want to thank my colleague, Mr. Lewis, for his work with me and this legislation. I also truly want to thank Mr. Pascrell. As he said, I hope it is a sign of things to come, where we can work together on important issues that face the American people. I urge all Members to support H.R. 3832, the Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act of 2016. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3832, the Stolen Identity Refund Fraud Prevention Act of 2016, as amended. While I support the legislation's underlying goal of deterring and preventing tax-related identity theft and tax fraud, I strongly oppose the bill's expansion of mandatory minimum sentencing. Section 5 of the bill would expand the mandatory minimums found in Title 18 Section 1028A of the United States Code. This section of Title 18 imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of two years for ``aggravated identity theft.'' Under section 5 of this bill, a violation of section 7206(b) of the Internal Revenue Code would require a judge to impose a two year mandatory minimum regardless of the circumstances of the case. While a two year sentence may be appropriate for most individuals convicted under this bill, it should be left to the discretion of the sentencing judge to determine the exact sentence based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. Research and evidence in the past few decades has demonstrated that mandatory minimums are ineffective deterrents, waste the taxpayers' money, force judges to impose irrational sentences, and discriminate against minorities, particularly with regards to drug offenses. Unfortunately, there are too many mandatory minimums in the federal code. Mr. Speaker, if we expect to do anything about that problem, the first step has to be to stop passing new ones. The mandatory minimums in the code today did not get there all at once--they got there one at a time, each one part of a larger bill, which on balance might have been a good idea. Therefore, the only way to stop passing new mandatory minimums is to stop passing bills that contain mandatory minimums. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote No on H.R. 3832. [[Page H2395]] The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3832, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_176.csv,26791,26791,26856,"[congressional record volume 162, number 77 (monday, may 16, 2016)] [house] [pages h2392-h2395] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] stolen identity refund fraud prevention act of 2016 mr. renacci. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 3832) to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to prevent tax-related identity theft and tax fraud, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 3832 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``stolen identity refund fraud prevention act of 2016''. sec. 2. centralized point of contact for identity theft victims. the secretary of the treasury, or the secretary's delegate, shall establish and maintain an office at the internal revenue service and procedures to ensure that any taxpayer whose return has been delayed or otherwise adversely affected due to the theft of the taxpayer's identity has a centralized point of contact throughout the processing of his or her case. the office shall coordinate with other offices within the internal revenue service to resolve the taxpayer's case as quickly as possible. sec. 3. taxpayer notification of suspected identity theft.

new jersey (mr. pascrell) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from ohio. general leave mr. renacci. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within [[page h2393]] which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on h.r. 3832, currently under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from ohio? there was no objection. mr. renacci. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise to urge approval of h.r. 3832, the stolen identity refund fraud prevention act of 2016. i introduced this bipartisan legislation with my friend and colleague, mr. lewis, to combat tax-related identity theft. on a personal note, it has been an honor to work with mr. lewis. he paid me a great compliment when he said i ``rained passion and truth'' on the important issue of identity theft. truthfully, since congressman lewis was first elected, he has been a legislator who has brought great passion and truth to every endeavor of his storied career. i truly thank him for working with me on this legislation. tax-related identity theft is an evolving criminal activity that targets innocent taxpayers nationwide and robs the treasury of billions of dollars each year. i was grateful for the opportunity last month to testify before the committee on ways and means about my experience with tax-related id theft. last year, my personal information was stolen, and someone used that information to electronically file a fraudulent tax return for my wife and me. that return, which included a fraudulent w-2 from the house of representatives, claimed a significant refund, with the proceeds directed to a bank account outside the u.s. so when it comes to id theft, i truly understand the impact that it has on taxpayers in northeast ohio and across the country. i am committed to cracking down on the growing threat, and this bipartisan bill is an important first step forward. i was pleased that two core components from this bill were included in the path act that passed last december. the remaining components of this bill will help further shield taxpayer dollars from thieves and reduce the hardships that are caused by this criminal activity. they include establishing a centralized point of contact at the irs for id theft victims. this will make it easier for victims to resolve their id theft tax cases and ensure a unit at the irs is held accountable for handling a taxpayer's case from start to finish. another one would improve the taxpayer notification of suspected id theft. when the irs determines there has been the unauthorized use of a taxpayer's identity, the irs would be required--as soon as practicable and without jeopardizing an investigation--to notify the taxpayer and give instructions to the taxpayer about filing a police report. the last one i will mention would require the irs to submit a study on the feasibility of establishing a program for id theft victims to be able to opt out of electronic filing. this provision would require the irs to report back to congress within 180 days on this issue. i also thank my friend, mr. pascrell, for his work on this issue and for his amendments that were incorporated into the bill during this markup last month. mr. speaker, tax-related identity theft is one of the most pressing challenges that we face in the world of tax administration. this complex and evolving threat requires cooperation from congress, the irs, state revenue agencies, and industry stakeholders. while i am aware that not every tax-related id theft problem is best served with a congressional solution, this legislation is an important first step in fighting id theft and in better protecting victims. i urge all members to support this bipartisan legislation. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. house of representatives, committee on the judiciary, washington, dc, may 13, 2016. hon. kevin brady, chairman, committee on ways & means, washington, dc. dear chairman brady: i am writing with respect to h.r. 3832, the ``stolen identity refund fraud prevention act,'' which was referred to the committee on ways and means and in addition to the committee on the judiciary. as a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in h.r. 3832 that fall within the rule x jurisdiction of the committee on the judiciary, i agree to discharge our committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the house floor for consideration. the judiciary committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of h.r. 3832 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any house-senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks that you support any such request. i would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to h.r. 3832, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the congressional record during floor consideration of h.r. 3832. sincerely, bob goodlatte, chairman. ____ house of representatives, committee on ways

3832, the stolen identity refund fraud prevention act of 2016. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. scott of virginia. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to h.r. 3832, the stolen identity refund fraud prevention act of 2016, as amended. while i support the legislation's underlying goal of deterring and preventing tax-related identity theft and tax fraud, i strongly oppose the bill's expansion of mandatory minimum sentencing. section 5 of the bill would expand the mandatory minimums found in title 18 section 1028a of the united states code. this section of title 18 imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of two years for ``aggravated identity theft.'' under section 5 of this bill, a violation of section 7206(b) of the internal revenue code would require a judge to impose a two year mandatory minimum regardless of the circumstances of the case. while a two year sentence may be appropriate for most individuals convicted under this bill, it should be left to the discretion of the sentencing judge to determine the exact sentence based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. research and evidence in the past few decades has demonstrated that mandatory minimums are ineffective deterrents, waste the taxpayers' money, force judges to impose irrational sentences, and discriminate against minorities, particularly with regards to drug offenses. unfortunately, there are too many mandatory minimums in the federal code. mr. speaker, if we expect to do anything about that problem, the first step has to be to stop passing new ones. the mandatory minimums in the code today did not get there all at once--they got there one at a time, each one part of a larger bill, which on balance might have been a good idea. therefore, the only way to stop passing new mandatory minimums is to stop passing bills that contain mandatory minimums. therefore, i urge my colleagues to vote no on h.r. 3832. [[page h2395]] the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from ohio (mr. renacci) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3832, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",26791
CREC-2016-05-16-pt1-PgH2397,CREC-2016-05-16,114,PROVIDING AUTHORITY TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE A TOLL BRIDGE ACROSS THE RIO GRANDE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2397-H2399] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROVIDING AUTHORITY TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE A TOLL BRIDGE ACROSS THE RIO GRANDE Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2143) to provide for the authority for the successors and assigns of the Starr-Camargo Bridge Company to maintain and operate a toll bridge across the Rio Grande near Rio Grande City, Texas, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 2143 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. STARR-CAMARGO BRIDGE. Public Law 87-532 (76 Stat. 153) is amended-- (1) in the first section, in subsection (a)(2)-- [[Page H2398]] (A) by inserting ``, and its successors and assigns,'' after ``State of Texas''; (B) by inserting ``consisting of not more than 14 lanes'' after ``approaches thereto''; and (C) by striking ``and for a period of sixty-six years from the date of completion of such bridge,''; (2) in section 2, by inserting ``and its successors and assigns,'' after ``companies''; (3) by redesignating sections 3, 4, and 5 as sections 4, 5, and 6, respectively; (4) by inserting after section 2 the following: ``SEC. 3. RIGHTS OF STARR-CAMARGO BRIDGE COMPANY AND SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. ``(a) In General.--The Starr-Camargo Bridge Company and its successors and assigns shall have the rights and privileges granted to the B and P Bridge Company and its successors and assigns under section 2 of the Act of May 1, 1928 (45 Stat. 471, chapter 466). ``(b) Requirement.--In exercising the rights and privileges granted under subsection (a), the Starr-Camargo Bridge Company and its successors and assigns shall act in accordance with-- ``(1) just compensation requirements; ``(2) public proceeding requirements; and ``(3) any other requirements applicable to the exercise of the rights referred to in subsection (a) under the laws of the State of Texas.''; and (5) in section 4 (as redesignated by paragraph (3))-- (A) by inserting ``and its successors and assigns,'' after ``such company''; (B) by striking ``or'' after ``public agency,''; (C) by inserting ``or to a corporation,'' after ``international bridge authority or commission,''; and (D) by striking ``authority, or commission'' each place it appears and inserting ``authority, commission, or corporation''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and to extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2143, the Starr-Camargo Bridge act, introduced by Senator Cornyn and by Representative Cuellar of Texas. With today's passage, this bill goes to the President's desk for signature. The Starr-Camargo Bridge act grants permanent authority to continue operating and maintaining the international bridge that connects Rio Grande City, Texas, with Mexican cities such as Monterrey and Mexico City. This bridge is one of 28 vehicle border crossings on the Texas- Mexico border and one of two privately owned crossing facilities. The Starr-Camargo Bridge has had continued growth in commercial traffic since 2009, and it plays an important role in facilitating legitimate trade and travel in the region. This bill, S. 2143, would permanently extend the authority for the Starr-Camargo Bridge Company to operate the bridge. It would grant the bridge company the same rights and privileges already granted to this body to the B and P Bridge Company in Progreso, Texas. By granting this authority, we would be incentivizing the Starr-Camargo Bridge Company to continue maintaining and expanding the bridge's capacity to keep up with growing trade and commerce along the Texas border with Mexico. This legislation received the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs when it was marked up last month. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me once again thank our chairman, Ed Royce, for bringing forward this bipartisan measure and for his continued good leadership on the committee. I also want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), my good friend, who introduced the House version of this legislation which has already passed the Senate. When it comes to our southern neighbor, Mexico, lately we have been hearing far too much about building walls. Mexico is a critically important partner to the United States. Our people share long, close ties, so we should be talking about building bridges, Mr. Speaker, not building walls. A few weeks ago, the Senate helped build a bridge by confirming a new Ambassador to Mexico, Roberta Jacobson. This was long overdue. She is excellent, and we are glad to have her on her way to Mexico City now. Today, with this bill, we are talking about, quite literally, strengthening a bridge between the United States and Mexico in the years ahead. The Starr-Camargo Bridge connects Rio Grande, Texas, with Monterrey and Ciudad Camargo in Mexico. The legal authority to operate this bridge will expire in 16 years. That may seem like a long way off, but as a result of that end date, we have already started to see a constraint in long-term investments. This bill would eliminate that expiration date. We have done the same thing before. The Weslaco-Progreso International Bridge once had a sunsetting authorization, and Congress acted to lift that deadline. This bill doesn't cost the U.S. taxpayers a penny, but it does clear the way for this bridge to remain an important conduit between our countries for years to come. It also sends an important message from those of us actually responsible for making laws and advancing American foreign policy. Mexico is an extremely important partner to the United States, and bridges--not barriers--will help that friendship to thrive. I support this measure. I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1645 Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. CUELLAR. I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Chairman Ed Royce for his leadership and for the help of his staff on this particular bill. Also, I thank my friend, the ranking member, Mr. Eliot Engel, and his staff also for supporting and helping us on this particular bill. As the lead sponsor of this bill, I rise in support of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, this bill will provide equity in the law and removes a level of uncertainty. In 1962, Congress authorized the Starr-Camargo International Bridge Company to construct, operate, and maintain the private toll bridge between the United States and Mexico near Rio Grande City, which is a city in my district. Congress, in drafting this original authorization, included a sunset clause of 66 years. In doing so, Congress left a level of uncertainty in the law, as it did not state what should happen to the bridge once the 66 years went by. Congress has authorized private toll bridges or other bridges along the U.S.-Mexico border before, yet previously had not included this sunset on the authorization. This sunset clause, while still a number of years away, has already begun to create issues for the owner and operator of the Starr-Camargo Bridge bill. Due to this uncertainty around what should happen to this bridge should the authorization lapse, they are unable to get much-needed long-term financing to make improvements and finance the long-term maintenance and operations of the bridge. This bill will give the Starr-Camargo Bridge permanent status. The Starr-Camargo Bridge plays an important role in our Nation's commerce and the economy of south Texas. The bridge supports 200 to 300 commercial trucks per day, consisting of construction materials as well as fresh fruits and vegetables coming north and machinery, oil, and recyclable products going south. The bridge further supports the crossing of around 4,000 cars a day. Today the United States trades an estimated $531 billion in goods and services with Mexico, our Nation's third largest trading partner, and this trade is only expected to grow in the future. In order for our Nation to take [[Page H2399]] full advantage of this trade, we must be clear in these sorts of uncertainties in the law. This bill, by ending the authorization's sunset, will afford the bridge greater opportunities to pursue and finance projects that will enhance and expand the capacity of the bridge and supporting facilities and further improve trade between the United States and Mexico. I would like to thank Senator Cornyn for working with me on this legislation and for taking that lead and, as I said a few minutes ago, Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their support as well as their staffs. I also would like to thank local leaders, Starr County Judge Eloy Vera and State Representative Ryan Guillen, for their support of this legislation. I ask my colleagues to support this important bill. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, in closing, again I want to emphasize that Mexico is a vital partner to the United States in terms of trade, security, and a wide range of regional concerns. We need to keep all the channels between our countries flowing, and that includes the physical connections between the U.S. and Mexico. This bill would help strengthen an important bridge between our countries and, at the same time, signal just how important we consider this friendship. I support this measure. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to thank Representative Cuellar for his steadfast leadership to ensure the House's consideration of this legislation and that we move forward on this. I thought I would also point out that this bill comes at no cost to the taxpayer. What it does instead is incentivizes the private sector to invest and maintain this important commercial border crossing. That is the point here. While the actual end date for the bridge's authority is still some years away, the lack of that permanent authority has already begun to constrain the financing of long-term improvements that will help make the crossing more efficient and secure. So I thank Mr. Cuellar again and, also, Mr. Castro and Mr. Poe, both members of the committee who have also been strong supporters. I thank Mr. Engel for helping to ensure that our border infrastructure is maintained and modernized to keep pace with the growing legitimate commercial activity across our southern border. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2143. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2397-H2399] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROVIDING AUTHORITY TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE A TOLL BRIDGE ACROSS THE RIO GRANDE Mr. ROYCE.

The bridge supports 200 to 300 commercial trucks per day, consisting of construction materials as well as fresh fruits and vegetables coming north and machinery, oil, and recyclable products going south. The bridge further supports the crossing of around 4,000 cars a day. Today the United States trades an estimated $531 billion in goods and services with Mexico, our Nation's third largest trading partner, and this trade is only expected to grow in the future. In order for our Nation to take [[Page H2399]] full advantage of this trade, we must be clear in these sorts of uncertainties in the law. This bill, by ending the authorization's sunset, will afford the bridge greater opportunities to pursue and finance projects that will enhance and expand the capacity of the bridge and supporting facilities and further improve trade between the United States and Mexico. I would like to thank Senator Cornyn for working with me on this legislation and for taking that lead and, as I said a few minutes ago, Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their support as well as their staffs. I also would like to thank local leaders, Starr County Judge Eloy Vera and State Representative Ryan Guillen, for their support of this legislation. I ask my colleagues to support this important bill. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, in closing, again I want to emphasize that Mexico is a vital partner to the United States in terms of trade, security, and a wide range of regional concerns. We need to keep all the channels between our countries flowing, and that includes the physical connections between the U.S. and Mexico. This bill would help strengthen an important bridge between our countries and, at the same time, signal just how important we consider this friendship. I support this measure. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to thank Representative Cuellar for his steadfast leadership to ensure the House's consideration of this legislation and that we move forward on this. I thought I would also point out that this bill comes at no cost to the taxpayer. What it does instead is incentivizes the private sector to invest and maintain this important commercial border crossing. That is the point here. While the actual end date for the bridge's authority is still some years away, the lack of that permanent authority has already begun to constrain the financing of long-term improvements that will help make the crossing more efficient and secure. So I thank Mr. Cuellar again and, also, Mr. Castro and Mr. Poe, both members of the committee who have also been strong supporters. I thank Mr. Engel for helping to ensure that our border infrastructure is maintained and modernized to keep pace with the growing legitimate commercial activity across our southern border. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2143. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_176.csv,11775,11775,11840,"[congressional record volume 162, number 77 (monday, may 16, 2016)] [house] [pages

have 5 legislative days to revise and to extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the record. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of s. 2143, the starr-camargo bridge act, introduced by senator cornyn and by representative cuellar of texas. with today's passage, this bill goes to the president's desk for signature. the starr-camargo bridge act grants permanent authority to continue operating and maintaining the international bridge that connects rio grande city, texas, with mexican cities such as monterrey and mexico city. this bridge is one of 28 vehicle border crossings on the texas- mexico border and one of two privately owned crossing facilities. the starr-camargo bridge has had continued growth in commercial traffic since 2009, and it plays an important role in facilitating legitimate trade and travel in the region. this bill, s. 2143, would permanently extend the authority for the starr-camargo bridge company to operate the bridge. it would grant the bridge company the same rights and privileges already granted to this body to the b and p bridge company in progreso, texas. by granting this authority, we would be incentivizing the starr-camargo bridge company to continue maintaining and expanding the bridge's capacity to keep up with growing trade and commerce along the texas border with mexico. this legislation received the full support of the committee on foreign affairs when it was marked up last month. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of this measure, and i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, let me once again thank our chairman, ed royce, for bringing forward this bipartisan measure and for his continued good leadership on the committee. i also want to thank the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar), my good friend, who introduced the house version of this legislation which has already passed the senate. when it comes to our southern neighbor, mexico, lately we have been hearing far too much about building walls. mexico is a critically important partner to the united states. our people share long, close ties, so we should be talking about building bridges, mr. speaker, not building walls. a few weeks ago, the senate helped build a bridge by confirming a new ambassador to mexico, roberta jacobson. this was long overdue. she is excellent, and we are glad to have her on her way to mexico city now. today, with this bill, we are talking about, quite literally, strengthening a bridge between the united states and mexico in the years ahead. the starr-camargo bridge connects rio grande, texas, with monterrey and ciudad camargo in mexico. the legal authority to operate this bridge will expire in 16 years. that may seem like a long way off, but as a result of that end date, we have already started to see a constraint in long-term investments. this bill would eliminate that expiration date. we have done the same thing before. the weslaco-progreso international bridge once had a sunsetting authorization, and congress acted to lift that deadline. this bill doesn't cost the u.s. taxpayers a penny, but it does clear the way for this bridge to remain an important conduit between our countries for years to come. it also sends an important message from those of us actually responsible for making laws and advancing american foreign policy. mexico is an extremely important partner to the united states, and bridges--not barriers--will help that friendship to thrive. i support this measure. i reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1645 mr. royce. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar). mr. cuellar. i thank my friend for yielding. mr. speaker, first of all, i want to thank chairman ed royce for his leadership and for the help of his staff on this particular bill. also, i thank my friend, the ranking member, mr. eliot engel, and his staff also for supporting and helping us on this particular bill. as the lead sponsor of this bill, i rise in support of this legislation. mr. speaker, this bill will provide equity in the law and removes a level of uncertainty. in 1962, congress authorized the starr-camargo international bridge company to construct, operate, and maintain the private toll bridge between the united states and mexico near rio grande city, which is a city in my district. congress, in drafting this original authorization, included a sunset clause of 66 years. in doing so, congress left a level of uncertainty in the law, as it did not state what should happen to the bridge once the 66 years went by. congress has authorized private toll bridges or other bridges along the u.s.-mexico border before, yet previously had not included this sunset on the authorization. this sunset clause, while still a number of years away, has already begun to create issues for the owner and operator of the starr-camargo bridge bill. due to this uncertainty around what should happen to this bridge should the authorization lapse, they are unable to get much-needed long-term financing to make improvements and finance the long-term maintenance and operations of the bridge. this bill will give the starr-camargo bridge permanent status. the starr-camargo bridge plays an important role in our nation's commerce and the economy of south texas. the bridge supports 200 to 300 commercial trucks per day, consisting of construction materials as well as fresh fruits and vegetables coming north and

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1887) to amend certain appropriation Acts to repeal the requirement directing the Administrator of General Services to sell Federal property and assets that support the operations of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Plum Island, New York, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1887 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) The Federal Government has owned Plum Island, New York, since 1899. (2) Since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center has conducted unrivaled scientific research on a variety of infectious animal-borne diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, resulting, most recently, in the development of a new cell line that rapidly and reliably detects this highly debilitating disease of livestock. (3) Over 62 years, the Center has had a strong, proven record of safety. (4) $23,200,000 in Federal dollars have been spent on upgrades to, and the maintenance of, the Center since January 2012. (5) In addition to the Center, Plum Island contains cultural, historical, ecological, and natural resources of regional and national significance. (6) Plum Island is situated where the Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay meet, both of which are estuaries that are part of the National Estuary Program and are environmentally and economically significant to the region. (7) The Federal Government has invested hundreds of millions of Federal dollars over the last two decades to make long-term improvements with respect to the conservation and management needs of Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay. [[Page H2407]] (8) The Department of Homeland Security has undertaken a study to consider alternatives for the final disposition of Plum Island, including an analysis of-- (A) conservation of the island's resources; (B) any remediation responsibilities; (C) the need for any legislative changes; (D) cost; and (E) any revenues from the alternatives. SEC. 2. REPORT REQUIRED ON STUDY BY DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ON CLEAN UP AND ALTERNATIVE USES OF PLUM ISLAND. (a) Assessment by Comptroller General.-- (1) Assessment required.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct an assessment of the study by the Department of Homeland Security on the options for the disposition of Plum Island referred to in section 1(8). Such assessment shall include a determination of whether the methodologies used by the Department in conducting such study adequately support the Department's findings with respect to the following: (A) The possible alternative uses for Plum Island, including the transfer of ownership to another Federal agency, a State or local government, a nonprofit organization, or a combination thereof for the purpose of education, research, or conservation. (B) The possible issues and implications, if any, of pursuing such alternative uses for Plum Island. (C) The potential cost to be incurred for expenses related to the transition, cleanup, and hazard mitigation of Plum Island by a recipient of such property. (2) Report required.--Not later than 180 days after the date on which the Department of Homeland Security completes the study referred to in section 1(8), the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a report containing the following: (A) The results of the assessment described under paragraph (1). (B) A description of the Secretary of Homeland Security's coordination with the Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in conducting the Department of Homeland Security study referred to in section 1(8). (b) Study by Comptroller General.-- (1) Study required.--If the Comptroller General of the United States determines that the methodologies referred to in subsection (a)(1) do not adequately support the Department of Homeland Security's findings related to an issue described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of such subsection, the Comptroller General shall conduct a study on any such issue. (2) Report required.--If the Comptroller General of the United States conducts a study under paragraph (1), not later than one year after the date on which the Department of Homeland Security completes the study referred to in section 1(8), the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1). SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF ACTION. No action may be taken to carry out section 538 of title V of division D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public Law 112-74; 125 Stat. 976) until at least 180 days after the reports required by subsection (a)(2) of section 2 and, if applicable, subsection (b)(2) of such section have been submitted to Congress. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, after my remarks, I will include an exchange of letters between the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Homeland Security regarding H.R. 1887. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1887, which suspends an appropriations provision in order to ensure that all necessary information is accessible before deciding how to move forward with Plum Island Animal Disease Center. Since 1954, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate's Plum Island Animal Disease Center has served the Nation in defending against accidental or intentional introduction of foreign animal diseases. In 2005, DHS announced that Plum Island would be moved to a new Federal facility in Kansas. While DHS will eventually move the research conducted, Plum Island will continue to operate until the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility is fully operational and a complete transition has been made in 2022 or 2023. The gentleman from New York, Representative Zeldin, my friend, introduced H.R. 1887 with strong bipartisan support from the entire Long Island and Connecticut delegations in both the House and the Senate to stop the sale of Plum Island. DHS recently undertook a study on alternatives for the disposition of Plum Island. As amended, H.R. 1887 suspends the sale of Plum Island until a thorough review of the analysis of alternatives is conducted by DHS and GAO. The bill before us today requires GAO to review the DHS study and report to Congress on whether the methodologies DHS uses adequately support the Department's findings. If those methodologies are found lacking, GAO must study possible alternative uses for Plum Island and possible costs associated for the transition and cleanup of the island. H.R. 1887 delays the sale of Plum Island until GAO reports its findings to Congress, allowing for a complete understanding of possible options for Plum Island once the Animal Disease Center functions are transitioned. This bill ensures consideration of all options for the disposition of the island. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, May, 12, 2016. Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 1887, a bill to amend certain appropriation Acts to repeal the requirement directing the Administrator of General Services to sell federal property and assets that support the operations of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Plum Island, New York.'' This legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In order to expedite Floor consideration of H.R. 1887, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members of the Committee to any conference committee named to consider such provisions. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the bill. I look forward to working with the Committee on Homeland Security as the bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Bill Shuster, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, May 16, 2016. Hon. Bill Shuster, Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1887. I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will not seek a sequential referral on the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this bill at this time, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1887 and yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York's Long Island Sound has served as the primary laboratory in the United States responsible for research on foreign animal diseases of livestock, such [[Page H2408]] as foot-and-mouth disease and other animal diseases that could be accidentally or deliberately introduced into the United States. At Plum Island, the Department of Homeland Security works with the Agricultural Research Service and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research and develop new vaccines and diagnostic tests to respond to animal disease outbreaks. On September 11, 2005, DHS announced plans to develop the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, or NBAF, as a state-of-the-art biocontainment laboratory to replace the Plum Island facility, an aging facility nearing the end of its lifecycle. After undertaking a multiyear site selection process, DHS selected a site in Manhattan, Kansas, for the NBAF. It is slated to begin operations in 2022. This brings us to H.R. 1887. The focus of this bill is to deal with the question of what to do with Plum Island once DHS no longer needs it. DHS is currently studying the range of options for disposition of the property, including transferring it to another Federal agency, a State or local government, or a nonprofit organization for the purposes of education, research, or conservation. In doing so, DHS is expected to assess the full implications of each option, including cost, cleanup, and hazard mitigation. H.R. 1887 requires the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, to assess whether DHS' forthcoming study is adequate to support its findings. In the event that the study is lacking in a key area, GAO would be required to conduct its own study on that issue or issues. Importantly, H.R. 1887 prohibits the sale of Plum Island operations until at least 180 days after the required reports in the bill have been submitted to Congress. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), my distinguished colleague. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and Mr. Thompson as well for both speaking in favor of this legislation, H.R. 1887. Plum Island is not for sale. The whole purpose of this legislation is to prevent the sale of Plum Island by the Federal Government to the highest bidder. Situated at the gateway of the Long Island Sound, Plum Island is treasured by my local community. As a critical resource for research, approximately 90 percent of the land on Plum Island has been sheltered from development, offering Long Island a diverse wildlife and ecosystem and a critical habitat for migratory birds, marine mammals, and rare plants. With recorded history dating back to the 1700s, Plum Island is also an essential cultural and historical resource as well. Since World War II, Plum Island has been utilized as a research laboratory. The facility, which has been under Federal jurisdiction since 1899, has since grown to become what is known today as the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. In 2005, the Department of Homeland Security, which currently has jurisdiction over the island, announced that the Animal Disease Center research would be moved to a new Federal facility: the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Kansas. To offset the cost of the relocation, a law was enacted that called for the private sale of Plum Island to the highest bidder. However, due to costs associated with the cleanup and closure of Plum Island and because of local zoning restrictions, the Federal Government would receive little compensation for the sale of Plum Island. Allowing for continued research, public access, and permanent preservation of the island, H.R. 1887 will reverse a 2008 law that mandated the sale of Plum Island. The bill, as amended, will commission the Government Accountability Office, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, which currently owns the island, to formulate a comprehensive plan for the future of the island. This plan will include possible alternative uses, which can include transfer of ownership to another Federal agency, the State or local government, nonprofit, or combination thereof, for the purpose of education, research, and conservation. Just less than 3 weeks ago, on April 28, 2016, H.R. 1887 was marked up with an amendment and passed out of the House Homeland Security Committee with unanimous bipartisan support. Currently, 24 Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber have signed on as cosponsors of this bill. I see the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) is here. He has long been championing this issue since before I got here. I would especially like to thank House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul for both taking such a direct, personal interest in helping with this effort in the House. Their leadership is very much appreciated. I would also like to thank all the locally elected officials, groups, and concerned residents on Long Island and elsewhere who have moved heaven and Earth to raise awareness of this cause and help recruit cosponsors. I encourage all my colleagues to vote in support of this critical bill. Hopefully, the Senate also passes this long-awaited legislation in earnest so that the President can sign this proposal into law this year. I have had the opportunity to visit Plum Island. It is a place where you feel as if you are thousands of miles away from Long Island. You have the history of Fort Terry, the coastline, the dunes, the waterways, the water hitting the rocks, and the seals. You literally feel as if you are nowhere near the Northeastern United States. It is a treasure, and it is one that should be protected. Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful for this Chamber's considering this legislation and hopefully passing it unanimously. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney). Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to, first of all, thank Mr. Thompson of Mississippi for his interest and support in this measure, even though he hails from a part of the country which is far away from the Long Island Sound. But, again, going back to his days on the Agriculture Committee, he clearly knows the forensics of this legislation, and, again, his interest and support is much appreciated. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) for bringing this bill up today. Again, Long Island Sound, maybe, is not right on your radar screen, but as Congressman Zeldin said, it is an incredibly special place, a tidal estuary which separates Connecticut from New York, and it is within the New York territory. Frankly, it is a very small, densely populated area, and the interest level on both sides of the Long Island Sound in terms of passage of this legislation is off the charts. I again want to thank Mr. Zeldin for his efforts. Again, this measure started in 2013 in response to the GAO report that basically signaled that the sale of this island was on the fast track, and it really took persistence up until today's vote on the floor to make sure that we stop that process, as Mr. Zeldin indicated, and send the message that Plum Island is not for sale. Again, because of its unique history, the activity that took place there with the Animal Disease Center made it unsuitable for residential development and commercial development, but sort of the outcome of that is that this incredibly rich diversity of biology has sprung up there. Like the gentleman from Long Island, I have had the opportunity to visit there, and it is as if you were in a different world. That is something that we can never take for granted, particularly in a part of the country where, again, there are tremendous amounts of sea traffic, maritime activity, and economic activity. To try and, again, basically preserve this 840-acre parcel with its incredible richness is something that really will live on for generations and, really, I think, will make the 114th Congress memorable, certainly in terms of that region, for many years to come. Again, like the gentleman from New York, I want to say that the external pressure which was brought to bear by municipal officials and by folks from [[Page H2409]] Save the Sound--that is an umbrella group on both sides of the Long Island Sound--and the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, again, is what really kept the interest level and the pressure on both delegations to make sure that this didn't get lost in the process and allow that mandated sale to move forward. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage of this bill, and, again, with the gentleman from New York, am determined to make sure that this moves as quickly as possible through the Upper Chamber and is signed into law by President Obama, sending a message to all the individuals and groups that are so interested in preserving Plum Island that, in fact, we, again, have taken it off this sort of conveyor belt and we are going to make sure that it gets the careful treatment that it deserves. At the end of the day, it is going to basically preserve this for generations to come. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1887 has broad bipartisan support. It will ensure that, before DHS disposes of Plum Island, there is a thorough vetting of all the options. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1730 Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support Mr. Zeldin's bill, H.R. 1887. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1887, repeals the requirement directing the Administrator of General Services to sell Federal property and assets that support the operations of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Plum Island, New York, and for other purposes. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security I support this bill because the safety record of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center is unparalleled. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center is a United States federal research facility dedicated to the study of animal diseases. It is part of the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology. Since 1954, the center has had the goal of protecting America's livestock from animal diseases Throughout the history of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, there have been no accidental releases of infected animals to the mainland. The Animal Disease Center on Plum Island has conducted first rate scientific research on a variety of infectious animal-borne diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, resulting most recently, in the development of a new cell line that rapidly and reliably detects this highly debilitating disease of livestock Mr. Speaker, in addition to the Animal Disease Center Plum Island contains cultural, historical, ecological, and natural resources of regional and national significance. Importantly, the Federal Government has invested hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars over the last two decades to make long-term improvements with respect to the conservation and management needs of Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay. Mr. Speaker, preserving historical and geographical entities play a pivotal role in maintaining homeland security and the sustainability of our ecosystem and health of our community. I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 1887. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1887, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to authorize the Comptroller General of the United States to assess a study on the alternatives for the disposition of Plum Island Animal Disease Center, and for other purposes.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2406-H2409] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1715 REQUIRING COMPTROLLER GENERAL TO ASSESS OPTIONS FOR DISPOSITION OF PLUM ISLAND ANIMAL DISEASE CENTER IN PLUM ISLAND, NEW YORK Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1887) to amend certain appropriation Acts to repeal the requirement directing the Administrator of General Services to sell Federal property and assets that support the operations of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Plum Island, New York, and for other purposes, as amended.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, after my remarks, I will include an exchange of letters between the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Homeland Security regarding H.R. 1887. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1887, which suspends an appropriations provision in order to ensure that all necessary information is accessible before deciding how to move forward with Plum Island Animal Disease Center. Since 1954, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate's Plum Island Animal Disease Center has served the Nation in defending against accidental or intentional introduction of foreign animal diseases. In 2005, DHS announced that Plum Island would be moved to a new Federal facility in Kansas. While DHS will eventually move the research conducted, Plum Island will continue to operate until the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility is fully operational and a complete transition has been made in 2022 or 2023. The gentleman from New York, Representative Zeldin, my friend, introduced H.R. 1887 with strong bipartisan support from the entire Long Island and Connecticut delegations in both the House and the Senate to stop the sale of Plum Island. DHS recently undertook a study on alternatives for the disposition of Plum Island. As amended, H.R. 1887 suspends the sale of Plum Island until a thorough review of the analysis of alternatives is conducted by DHS and GAO. The bill before us today requires GAO to review the DHS study and report to Congress on whether the methodologies DHS uses adequately support the Department's findings. If those methodologies are found lacking, GAO must study possible alternative uses for Plum Island and possible costs associated for the transition and cleanup of the island. H.R. 1887 delays the sale of Plum Island until GAO reports its findings to Congress, allowing for a complete understanding of possible options for Plum Island once the Animal Disease Center functions are transitioned. This bill ensures consideration of all options for the disposition of the island. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, May, 12, 2016. Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 1887, a bill to amend certain appropriation Acts to repeal the requirement directing the Administrator of General Services to sell federal property and assets that support the operations of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Plum Island, New York.'' This legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In order to expedite Floor consideration of H.R. 1887, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members of the Committee to any conference committee named to consider such provisions. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the bill. I look forward to working with the Committee on Homeland Security as the bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Bill Shuster, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, May 16, 2016. Hon. Bill Shuster, Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1887. I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will not seek a sequential referral on the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this bill at this time, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1887 and yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York's Long Island Sound has served as the primary laboratory in the United States responsible for research on foreign animal diseases of livestock, such [[Page H2408]] as foot-and-mouth disease and other animal diseases that could be accidentally or deliberately introduced into the United States. At Plum Island, the Department of Homeland Security works with the Agricultural Research Service and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research and develop new vaccines and diagnostic tests to respond to animal disease outbreaks. On September 11, 2005, DHS announced plans to develop the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, or NBAF, as a state-of-the-art biocontainment laboratory to replace the Plum Island facility, an aging facility nearing the end of its lifecycle. After undertaking a multiyear site selection process, DHS selected a site in Manhattan, Kansas, for the NBAF. It is slated to begin operations in 2022. This brings us to H.R. 1887. The focus of this bill is to deal with the question of what to do with Plum Island once DHS no longer needs it. DHS is currently studying the range of options for disposition of the property, including transferring it to another Federal agency, a State or local government, or a nonprofit organization for the purposes of education, research, or conservation. In doing so, DHS is expected to assess the full implications of each option, including cost, cleanup, and hazard mitigation. H.R. 1887 requires the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, to assess whether DHS' forthcoming study is adequate to support its findings. In the event that the study is lacking in a key area, GAO would be required to conduct its own study on that issue or issues. Importantly, H.R. 1887 prohibits the sale of Plum Island operations until at least 180 days after the required reports in the bill have been submitted to Congress. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), my distinguished colleague. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and Mr. Thompson as well for both speaking in favor of this legislation, H.R. 1887. Plum Island is not for sale. The whole purpose of this legislation is to prevent the sale of Plum Island by the Federal Government to the highest bidder. Situated at the gateway of the Long Island Sound, Plum Island is treasured by my local community. As a critical resource for research, approximately 90 percent of the land on Plum Island has been sheltered from development, offering Long Island a diverse wildlife and ecosystem and a critical habitat for migratory birds, marine mammals, and rare plants. With recorded history dating back to the 1700s, Plum Island is also an essential cultural and historical resource as well. Since World War II, Plum Island has been utilized as a research laboratory. The facility, which has been under Federal jurisdiction since 1899, has since grown to become what is known today as the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. In 2005, the Department of Homeland Security, which currently has jurisdiction over the island, announced that the Animal Disease Center research would be moved to a new Federal facility: the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Kansas. To offset the cost of the relocation, a law was enacted that called for the private sale of Plum Island to the highest bidder. However, due to costs associated with the cleanup and closure of Plum Island and because of local zoning restrictions, the Federal Government would receive little compensation for the sale of Plum Island. Allowing for continued research, public access, and permanent preservation of the island, H.R. 1887 will reverse a 2008 law that mandated the sale of Plum Island. The bill, as amended, will commission the Government Accountability Office, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, which currently owns the island, to formulate a comprehensive plan for the future of the island. This plan will include possible alternative uses, which can include transfer of ownership to another Federal agency, the State or local government, nonprofit, or combination thereof, for the purpose of education, research, and conservation. Just less than 3 weeks ago, on April 28, 2016, H.R. 1887 was marked up with an amendment and passed out of the House Homeland Security Committee with unanimous bipartisan support. Currently, 24 Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber have signed on as cosponsors of this bill. I see the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) is here. He has long been championing this issue since before I got here. I would especially like to thank House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul for both taking such a direct, personal interest in helping with this effort in the House. Their leadership is very much appreciated. I would also like to thank all the locally elected officials, groups, and concerned residents on Long Island and elsewhere who have moved heaven and Earth to raise awareness of this cause and help recruit cosponsors. I encourage all my colleagues to vote in support of this critical bill. Hopefully, the Senate also passes this long-awaited legislation in earnest so that the President can sign this proposal into law this year. I have had the opportunity to visit Plum Island. It is a place where you feel as if you are thousands of miles away from Long Island. You have the history of Fort Terry, the coastline, the dunes, the waterways, the water hitting the rocks, and the seals. You literally feel as if you are nowhere near the Northeastern United States. It is a treasure, and it is one that should be protected. Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful for this Chamber's considering this legislation and hopefully passing it unanimously. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney). Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to, first of all, thank Mr. Thompson of Mississippi for his interest and support in this measure, even though he hails from a part of the country which is far away from the Long Island Sound. But, again, going back to his days on the Agriculture Committee, he clearly knows the forensics of this legislation, and, again, his interest and support is much appreciated. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) for bringing this bill up today. Again, Long Island Sound, maybe, is not right on your radar screen, but as Congressman Zeldin said, it is an incredibly special place, a tidal estuary which separates Connecticut from New York, and it is within the New York territory. Frankly, it is a very small, densely populated area, and the interest level on both sides of the Long Island Sound in terms of passage of this legislation is off the charts. I again want to thank Mr. Zeldin for his efforts. Again, this measure started in 2013 in response to the GAO report that basically signaled that the sale of this island was on the fast track, and it really took persistence up until today's vote on the floor to make sure that we stop that process, as Mr. Zeldin indicated, and send the message that Plum Island is not for sale. Again, because of its unique history, the activity that took place there with the Animal Disease Center made it unsuitable for residential development and commercial development, but sort of the outcome of that is that this incredibly rich diversity of biology has sprung up there. Like the gentleman from Long Island, I have had the opportunity to visit there, and it is as if you were in a different world. That is something that we can never take for granted, particularly in a part of the country where, again, there are tremendous amounts of sea traffic, maritime activity, and economic activity. To try and, again, basically preserve this 840-acre parcel with its incredible richness is something that really will live on for generations and, really, I think, will make the 114th Congress memorable, certainly in terms of that region, for many years to come. Again, like the gentleman from New York, I want to say that the external pressure which was brought to bear by municipal officials and by folks from [[Page H2409]] Save the Sound--that is an umbrella group on both sides of the Long Island Sound--and the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, again, is what really kept the interest level and the pressure on both delegations to make sure that this didn't get lost in the process and allow that mandated sale to move forward. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage of this bill, and, again, with the gentleman from New York, am determined to make sure that this moves as quickly as possible through the Upper Chamber and is signed into law by President Obama, sending a message to all the individuals and groups that are so interested in preserving Plum Island that, in fact, we, again, have taken it off this sort of conveyor belt and we are going to make sure that it gets the careful treatment that it deserves. At the end of the day, it is going to basically preserve this for generations to come. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1887 has broad bipartisan support. It will ensure that, before DHS disposes of Plum Island, there is a thorough vetting of all the options. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1730 Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support Mr. Zeldin's bill, H.R. 1887. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, after my remarks, I will include an exchange of letters between the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Homeland Security regarding H.R. 1887. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1887, which suspends an appropriations provision in order to ensure that all necessary information is accessible before deciding how to move forward with Plum Island Animal Disease Center. Since 1954, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate's Plum Island Animal Disease Center has served the Nation in defending against accidental or intentional introduction of foreign animal diseases. In 2005, DHS announced that Plum Island would be moved to a new Federal facility in Kansas. While DHS will eventually move the research conducted, Plum Island will continue to operate until the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility is fully operational and a complete transition has been made in 2022 or 2023. The gentleman from New York, Representative Zeldin, my friend, introduced H.R. 1887 with strong bipartisan support from the entire Long Island and Connecticut delegations in both the House and the Senate to stop the sale of Plum Island. DHS recently undertook a study on alternatives for the disposition of Plum Island. As amended, H.R. 1887 suspends the sale of Plum Island until a thorough review of the analysis of alternatives is conducted by DHS and GAO. The bill before us today requires GAO to review the DHS study and report to Congress on whether the methodologies DHS uses adequately support the Department's findings. If those methodologies are found lacking, GAO must study possible alternative uses for Plum Island and possible costs associated for the transition and cleanup of the island. H.R. 1887 delays the sale of Plum Island until GAO reports its findings to Congress, allowing for a complete understanding of possible options for Plum Island once the Animal Disease Center functions are transitioned. This bill ensures consideration of all options for the disposition of the island. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, May, 12, 2016. Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC.

Mr. Speaker, since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York's Long Island Sound has served as the primary laboratory in the United States responsible for research on foreign animal diseases of livestock, such [[Page H2408]] as foot-and-mouth disease and other animal diseases that could be accidentally or deliberately introduced into the United States. At Plum Island, the Department of Homeland Security works with the Agricultural Research Service and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research and develop new vaccines and diagnostic tests to respond to animal disease outbreaks. On September 11, 2005, DHS announced plans to develop the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, or NBAF, as a state-of-the-art biocontainment laboratory to replace the Plum Island facility, an aging facility nearing the end of its lifecycle. After undertaking a multiyear site selection process, DHS selected a site in Manhattan, Kansas, for the NBAF. It is slated to begin operations in 2022. This brings us to H.R. 1887. The focus of this bill is to deal with the question of what to do with Plum Island once DHS no longer needs it. DHS is currently studying the range of options for disposition of the property, including transferring it to another Federal agency, a State or local government, or a nonprofit organization for the purposes of education, research, or conservation. In doing so, DHS is expected to assess the full implications of each option, including cost, cleanup, and hazard mitigation. H.R. 1887 requires the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, to assess whether DHS' forthcoming study is adequate to support its findings. In the event that the study is lacking in a key area, GAO would be required to conduct its own study on that issue or issues. Importantly, H.R. 1887 prohibits the sale of Plum Island operations until at least 180 days after the required reports in the bill have been submitted to Congress. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), my distinguished colleague. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and Mr. Thompson as well for both speaking in favor of this legislation, H.R. 1887. Plum Island is not for sale. The whole purpose of this legislation is to prevent the sale of Plum Island by the Federal Government to the highest bidder. Situated at the gateway of the Long Island Sound, Plum Island is treasured by my local community. As a critical resource for research, approximately 90 percent of the land on Plum Island has been sheltered from development, offering Long Island a diverse wildlife and ecosystem and a critical habitat for migratory birds, marine mammals, and rare plants. With recorded history dating back to the 1700s, Plum Island is also an essential cultural and historical resource as well. Since World War II, Plum Island has been utilized as a research laboratory. The facility, which has been under Federal jurisdiction since 1899, has since grown to become what is known today as the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. In 2005, the Department of Homeland Security, which currently has jurisdiction over the island, announced that the Animal Disease Center research would be moved to a new Federal facility: the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Kansas. To offset the cost of the relocation, a law was enacted that called for the private sale of Plum Island to the highest bidder. However, due to costs associated with the cleanup and closure of Plum Island and because of local zoning restrictions, the Federal Government would receive little compensation for the sale of Plum Island. Allowing for continued research, public access, and permanent preservation of the island, H.R. 1887 will reverse a 2008 law that mandated the sale of Plum Island. The bill, as amended, will commission the Government Accountability Office, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, which currently owns the island, to formulate a comprehensive plan for the future of the island. This plan will include possible alternative uses, which can include transfer of ownership to another Federal agency, the State or local government, nonprofit, or combination thereof, for the purpose of education, research, and conservation. Just less than 3 weeks ago, on April 28, 2016, H.R. 1887 was marked up with an amendment and passed out of the House Homeland Security Committee with unanimous bipartisan support. Currently, 24 Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber have signed on as cosponsors of this bill. I see the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) is here. He has long been championing this issue since before I got here. I would especially like to thank House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul for both taking such a direct, personal interest in helping with this effort in the House. Their leadership is very much appreciated. I would also like to thank all the locally elected officials, groups, and concerned residents on Long Island and elsewhere who have moved heaven and Earth to raise awareness of this cause and help recruit cosponsors. I encourage all my colleagues to vote in support of this critical bill. Hopefully, the Senate also passes this long-awaited legislation in earnest so that the President can sign this proposal into law this year. I have had the opportunity to visit Plum Island. It is a place where you feel as if you are thousands of miles away from Long Island. You have the history of Fort Terry, the coastline, the dunes, the waterways, the water hitting the rocks, and the seals. You literally feel as if you are nowhere near the Northeastern United States. It is a treasure, and it is one that should be protected. Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful for this Chamber's considering this legislation and hopefully passing it unanimously. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney). Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to, first of all, thank Mr. Thompson of Mississippi for his interest and support in this measure, even though he hails from a part of the country which is far away from the Long Island Sound. But, again, going back to his days on the Agriculture Committee, he clearly knows the forensics of this legislation, and, again, his interest and support is much appreciated. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) for bringing this bill up today. Again, Long Island Sound, maybe, is not right on your radar screen, but as Congressman Zeldin said, it is an incredibly special place, a tidal estuary which separates Connecticut from New York, and it is within the New York territory. Frankly, it is a very small, densely populated area, and the interest level on both sides of the Long Island Sound in terms of passage of this legislation is off the charts. I again want to thank Mr. Zeldin for his efforts. Again, this measure started in 2013 in response to the GAO report that basically signaled that the sale of this island was on the fast track, and it really took persistence up until today's vote on the floor to make sure that we stop that process, as Mr. Zeldin indicated, and send the message that Plum Island is not for sale. Again, because of its unique history, the activity that took place there with the Animal Disease Center made it unsuitable for residential development and commercial development, but sort of the outcome of that is that this incredibly rich diversity of biology has sprung up there. Like the gentleman from Long Island, I have had the opportunity to visit there, and it is as if you were in a different world. That is something that we can never take for granted, particularly in a part of the country where, again, there are tremendous amounts of sea traffic, maritime activity, and economic activity. To try and, again, basically preserve this 840-acre parcel with its incredible richness is something that really will live on for generations and, really, I think, will make the 114th Congress memorable, certainly in terms of that region, for many years to come. Again, like the gentleman from New York, I want to say that the external pressure which was brought to bear by municipal officials and by folks from [[Page H2409]] Save the Sound--that is an umbrella group on both sides of the Long Island Sound--and the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, again, is what really kept the interest level and the pressure on both delegations to make sure that this didn't get lost in the process and allow that mandated sale to move forward. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage of this bill, and, again, with the gentleman from New York, am determined to make sure that this moves as quickly as possible through the Upper Chamber and is signed into law by President Obama, sending a message to all the individuals and groups that are so interested in preserving Plum Island that, in fact, we, again, have taken it off this sort of conveyor belt and we are going to make sure that it gets the careful treatment that it deserves. At the end of the day, it is going to basically preserve this for generations to come. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1887 has broad bipartisan support. It will ensure that, before DHS disposes of Plum Island, there is a thorough vetting of all the options. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1730 Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support Mr. Zeldin's bill, H.R. 1887. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1887, repeals the requirement directing the Administrator of General Services to sell Federal property and assets that support the operations of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Plum Island, New York, and for other purposes. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security I support this bill because the safety record of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center is unparalleled. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center is a United States federal research facility dedicated to the study of animal diseases. It is part of the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology. Since 1954, the center has had the goal of protecting America's livestock from animal diseases Throughout the history of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, there have been no accidental releases of infected animals to the mainland. The Animal Disease Center on Plum Island has conducted first rate scientific research on a variety of infectious animal-borne diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, resulting most recently, in the development of a new cell line that rapidly and reliably detects this highly debilitating disease of livestock Mr. Speaker, in addition to the Animal Disease Center Plum Island contains cultural, historical, ecological, and natural resources of regional and national significance. Importantly, the Federal Government has invested hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars over the last two decades to make long-term improvements with respect to the conservation and management needs of Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay. Mr. Speaker, preserving historical and geographical entities play a pivotal role in maintaining homeland security and the sustainability of our ecosystem and health of our community. I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 1887. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1887, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to authorize the Comptroller General of the United States to assess a study on the alternatives for the disposition of Plum Island Animal Disease Center, and for other purposes.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_176.csv,23238,23238,23303,"[congressional record volume 162, number 77 (monday, may 16, 2016)] [house] [pages h2406-h2409] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1715 requiring comptroller general to assess options for disposition of plum island animal disease center in plum island, new york mr. ratcliffe. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 1887) to amend certain appropriation acts to repeal the requirement directing the administrator of general services to sell federal property and assets that support the operations of the plum island animal disease center in plum island, new york, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 1887 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. findings. congress finds the following: (1) the federal government has owned plum island, new york, since 1899.

tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from texas? there was no objection. mr. ratcliffe. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, after my remarks, i will include an exchange of letters between the committee on transportation and infrastructure and the committee on homeland security regarding h.r. 1887. mr. speaker, today i rise in support of h.r. 1887, which suspends an appropriations provision in order to ensure that all necessary information is accessible before deciding how to move forward with plum island animal disease center. since 1954, the u.s. department of homeland security science and technology directorate's plum island animal disease center has served the nation in defending against accidental or intentional introduction of foreign animal diseases. in 2005, dhs announced that plum island would be moved to a new federal facility in kansas. while dhs will eventually move the research conducted, plum island will continue to operate until the national bio and agro-defense facility is fully operational and a complete transition has been made in 2022 or 2023. the gentleman from new york, representative zeldin, my friend, introduced h.r. 1887 with strong bipartisan support from the entire long island and connecticut delegations in both the house and the senate to stop the sale of plum island. dhs recently undertook a study on alternatives for the disposition of plum island. as amended, h.r. 1887 suspends the sale of plum island until a thorough review of the analysis of alternatives is conducted by dhs and gao. the bill before us today requires gao to review the dhs study and report to congress on whether the methodologies dhs uses adequately support the department's findings. if those methodologies are found lacking, gao must study possible alternative uses for plum island and possible costs associated for the transition and cleanup of the island. h.r. 1887 delays the sale of plum island until gao reports its findings to congress, allowing for a complete understanding of possible options for plum island once the animal disease center functions are transitioned. this bill ensures consideration of all options for the disposition of the island. mr. speaker, i urge all members to join me in supporting this bill. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. committee on transportation and infrastructure, house of representatives, washington, dc, may, 12, 2016. hon. michael mccaul, chairman, committee on homeland security, washington, dc. dear chairman mccaul: i write concerning h.r. 1887, a bill to amend certain appropriation acts to repeal the requirement directing the administrator of general services to sell federal property and assets that support the operations of the plum island animal disease center in plum island, new york.'' this legislation includes matters that fall within the rule x jurisdiction of the committee on transportation and infrastructure. in order to expedite floor consideration of h.r. 1887, the committee on transportation and infrastructure will forgo action on this bill. however, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the committee's rule x jurisdiction. i request you urge the speaker to name members of the committee to any conference committee named to consider such provisions. please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the congressional record during house floor consideration of the bill. i look forward to working with the committee on homeland security as the bill moves through the legislative process. sincerely, bill shuster, chairman. ____ house of representatives, committee on homeland security, washington, dc, may 16, 2016. hon. bill shuster, chairman, committee on transportation and infrastructure, washington, dc. dear chairman shuster: thank you for your letter regarding h.r. 1887. i appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the house of representatives, and accordingly, understand that the committee on transportation and infrastructure will not seek a sequential referral on the bill. the committee on homeland security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this bill at this time, the committee on transportation and infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. in addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, i would support your request to have the committee on transportation and infrastructure represented on the conference committee. i will insert copies of this exchange in the congressional record during consideration of this bill on the house floor. i thank you for your cooperation in this matter. sincerely, michael t. mccaul, chairman, committee on homeland security. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 1887 and yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, since 1954, the plum island animal disease center in new york's long island sound has served as the primary laboratory in the united states responsible for research on foreign animal diseases of livestock, such [[page h2408]] as foot-and-mouth disease and other animal diseases that could be accidentally or deliberately introduced into the united states. at plum island, the department of homeland security works with the agricultural research service and animal and plant health inspection service within the u.s. department of agriculture to research and develop new vaccines and diagnostic tests to respond to animal disease outbreaks. on september 11, 2005, dhs announced plans to develop the national bio and agro-defense facility, or nbaf, as a state-of-the-art biocontainment laboratory to replace the plum island facility, an aging facility nearing the end of its lifecycle. after undertaking a multiyear site selection process, dhs selected a site in manhattan, kansas, for the nbaf. it is slated to begin operations in 2022. this brings us to h.r. 1887. the focus of this bill is to deal with the question of what to do with plum island once dhs no longer needs it. dhs is currently studying the range of options for disposition of the property, including transferring it to another federal agency, a state or local government, or a nonprofit organization for the purposes of education, research, or conservation. in doing so, dhs is expected to assess the full implications of each option, including cost, cleanup, and hazard mitigation. h.r. 1887 requires the government accountability office, or gao, to assess whether dhs' forthcoming study is adequate to support its findings. in the event that the study is lacking in a key area, gao would be required to conduct its own study on that issue or issues. importantly, h.r. 1887 prohibits the sale of plum island operations until at least 180 days after the required reports in the bill have been submitted to congress. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. ratcliffe. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from new york (mr. zeldin), my distinguished colleague. mr. zeldin. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from texas (mr. ratcliffe) and mr. thompson as well for both speaking in favor of this legislation, h.r. 1887. plum island is not for sale. the whole purpose of this legislation is to prevent the sale of plum island by the federal government to the highest bidder. situated at the gateway of the long island sound, plum island

the house homeland security committee with unanimous bipartisan support. currently, 24 republicans and democrats in this chamber have signed on as cosponsors of this bill. i see the gentleman from connecticut (mr. courtney) is here. he has long been championing this issue since before i got here. i would especially like to thank house majority leader kevin mccarthy and house homeland security committee chairman michael mccaul for both taking such a direct, personal interest in helping with this effort in the house. their leadership is very much appreciated. i would also like to thank all

Res. 88 Whereas the Cold War years cemented the close friendship between the United States and Taiwan, with Taiwan as an anti- Communist ally in the Asia-Pacific; Whereas United States economic aid prevented Taiwan from sliding into an economic depression in the 1950s and greatly contributed to the island's later economic takeoff; Whereas Taiwan has flourished to become a beacon of democracy in Asia and leading trade partner for the United States, and the relationship has endured for more than 65 years through many shifts in Asia's geopolitical landscape; Whereas the strong relationship between the United States and Taiwan is based on mutually beneficial security, commercial, and cultural ties; Whereas Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Susan Thornton stated in her testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on February 11, 2016, that ``The people on Taiwan have built a prosperous, free, and orderly society with strong institutions, worthy of emulation and envy''; Whereas Deputy Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken stated on March 29, 2016, that with Taiwan's January 2016 elections, ``the people of Taiwan showed the world again what a mature, Chinese-speaking democracy looks like''; Whereas on January 1, 1979, when the Carter Administration established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC), it ended formal diplomatic ties with the Republic of China on Taiwan; Whereas, the United States Congress acted swiftly to reaffirm the United States-Taiwan relationship with the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act just 100 days later, ensuring the United States maintained a robust and enduring relationship with Taiwan; Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8) was enacted on April 10, 1979, codifying into law the basis for continued commercial, cultural, and other relations between the United States and Taiwan; Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted ``to help maintain peace, security, and stability in the Western Pacific'', which ``are in the political, security, and economic interests of the United States and are matters of international concern''; Whereas the United States Congress significantly strengthened the draft legislation originally submitted by the Executive Branch to include provisions concerning Taiwan's security in the Taiwan Relations Act; Whereas then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kin Moy stated in his written testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 14, 2014, that, ``Our enduring relationship under the Taiwan Relations Act represents a unique asset for the United States and is an important multiplier of our influence in the region'', and credited the Taiwan Relations Act for having ``played such a key part in protecting Taiwan's freedom of action and U.S. interests the last 35 years in the Asia-Pacific area''; Whereas then-Special Assistant to the President and National Security Council Senior Director for Asian Affairs Evan Medeiros noted on March 28, 2014 that the Taiwan Relations Act was ``an enduring expression to the people of Taiwan about our commitment to their well-being, their security, their economic autonomy, and their international space''; Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act states ``the United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means''; Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act states that it is the policy of the United States to ``provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character'' and ``to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan''; Whereas each successive United States Administration since the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act has provided arms of a defensive character to Taiwan; Whereas a 2015 Department of Defense report to Congress on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China stated that, ``Preparing for potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait remains the focus and primary driver of China's military investment''; Whereas the United States has an abiding interest in the preservation of cross-Strait peace and stability, and in peace and stability in the entire Asia-Pacific region; Whereas on July 14, 1982, as the United States negotiated with the People's Republic of China over the wording of a joint communique' related to United States arms sales to Taiwan, President Ronald Reagan instructed his representative in Taiwan, American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Director James R.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 88. I would like to recognize Mr. Chabot for his longstanding dedication and support for the people of Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, Taiwan has always been a strong friend and critical ally to the United States. Congress has been central to this relationship, championing a strong relationship with Taiwan through landmark measures like the Taiwan Relations Act and through pressing successive administrations to fulfill their obligation to sell defensive arms to Taiwan. Taiwan is now the United States' ninth largest trading partner, and it is in the U.S.' interest to have a stable and a prosperous Taiwan. It is an exciting time in Taiwan. In January, a free and fair election once again demonstrated the strength and vibrancy of Taiwan's democratic system. And in 3 days, we expect the newly elected President to be inaugurated in a peaceful transfer of power from one party to another. The people of Taiwan should be proud of their prosperous, free, and democratic society and what they have been able to accomplish, despite having to face countless challenges outside of their control. Mr. Speaker, when the U.S. established diplomatic relations with the [[Page H2396]] People's Republic of China on January 1, 1979, the U.S. Congress acted just 100 days later to pass the Taiwan Relations Act, which would ensure that the United States maintained a robust and enduring relationship with Taiwan. Three years later, in 1982, President Reagan deepened the U.S. commitment to Taiwan by issuing the Six Assurances to Taiwan, which included treating Taiwan as we would treat any one of our allies when making decisions on defensive arms sales, not setting a date for termination of arms sales, and not altering the Taiwan Relations Act. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is especially important when it comes to the Six Assurances. When the Reagan administration delivered the Six Assurances, it was by way of a verbal agreement and has largely remained as such since 1982. Today, by passing this resolution, Congress is going on record that the cornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan policy is not only the Taiwan Relations Act, but also the Six Assurances. This important measure solidifies President Reagan's commitment to Taiwan and urges this administration and the ones that follow to publicly, proactively, and consistently take the Six Assurances into account when handling United States-Taiwan relations. I am proud that in the 114th Congress we have already passed legislation which supports Taiwan's inclusion in INTERPOL and that we are now also passing a measure which will reassure our friends in Taiwan and press the administration to continue to abide by the Six Assurances. I am also proud that maintaining a strong relationship with Taiwan continues to be a bipartisan issue. I appreciate Mr. Eliot Engel's support on this initiative, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Let me say that, by passing this resolution, we, the United States Congress, are yet again taking another step toward strengthening the U.S.-Taiwan partnership. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this resolution. Let me once again thank Chairman Ed Royce and our colleague from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who introduced this measure. At the end of this week, Taiwan will swear in a new President, marking another peaceful democratic transition in that country. I have had the pleasure of meeting the President-elect, Dr. Tsai Ing-wen, several times as well as the country's outgoing leader, President Ma. And though they represent different political parties, it is clear that they are both fully committed to Taiwan's vibrant democracy and open society. Those values are also at the root of the close ties between the United States and Taiwan. This resolution affirms our commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances. These are the measures that have underpinned our relationship with the Taiwanese people since we normalized relations with the People's Republic of China. As Taiwan prepares for this week's political transition, it is vital that the United States send a clear signal that we continue to stand with the people of Taiwan on a range of issues, from Taiwan's defense to its growing role on the global stage, to its commitment to freedom and democracy. So I am happy to support this measure. We should continue to stand with our partners in Taiwan, and I wish the people of Taiwan well as they swear in a new President this week. I might add, it is the first woman President of Taiwan. I urge support for this resolution. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot). He is chairman of the Small Business Committee, a senior member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the author of this measure. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 88. I was one of the original founders of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus. It was a bipartisan group of people who founded it. I have been the chairman of the Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. I have been a longtime friend of Taiwan. I have been there probably a dozen times over the years. This important legislation reaffirms the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances as cornerstones of U.S.-Taiwan relations. As a longtime supporter of Taiwan, as I mentioned, I believe that the U.S.-Taiwan relationship is absolutely vital to the security and sustainability not just of Taiwan, but of the whole region. Taiwan is a close ally, one that truly believes and practices freedom and democracy. We witnessed this firsthand this past January, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, when the people of Taiwan held democratic national elections resulting in the election of Tsai Ing- wen. I want to congratulate her and wish her best wishes in her role as President of Taiwan. Taiwan elects their people democratically, unlike the PRC right across the Taiwan Strait. As we know, China has been bullying Taiwan for many years now. It is unfortunate that the PRC, China, doesn't follow, as an example, the people of Taiwan, who democratically elect their leaders. {time} 1630 Taiwan faces an unrelenting threat from China, which has nearly 1,600 ballistic missiles aimed at this small island. I remember when I came to Congress about 20 years ago, we talked about how scary it was that there were a couple hundred, 200 or 300 missiles aimed at Taiwan at that time. That has increased over the years to 1,600 missiles aimed at Taiwan from China. Although Taiwan enjoys de facto independence, China's ultimate goal is to take over Taiwan, to annex Taiwan, whatever the people of Taiwan believe. We absolutely cannot let that happen. China's ultimate goal, as I say, is the annexation of the island. We have all seen the growing hostilities in the East China Sea and South China Sea over the last couple years. I believe that this legislation underscores the point that the Taiwan Strait continues to be one of the potential flash points on the globe. We have seen China literally building islands and then militarizing those islands, much to the chagrin of all their neighbors in the region, from Japan to Vietnam, to Taiwan, to the Philippines, and on and on. That is what the PRC, China, has been up to. Any sort of solution between China and Taiwan should be reached in a peaceful and fair manner and only with the agreement of the people of Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, April 10, 2016, marked the 37th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act, the TRA. This act codifies into law an institutional framework and legal basis for continued interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, and it serves to maintain peace and stability in the western Pacific. When President Ronald Reagan agreed to sign the U.S.-China third communique in 1982, he was aware of the communique's effect on Taiwan and fully recognized that Taiwan needed to be reassured that they would not be abandoned--and they will not be abandoned--by the United States. In order to reinforce American support for Taiwan, the United States issued the Six Assurances. The Six Assurances provided a framework for sustaining the unique relationship between the United States and our ally, Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, they are as valid today as they were back in 1982. They rightfully function along with the TRA, as cornerstones of U.S.-Taiwan relations. I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker, it is important that the democracies of the world stand together to help strengthen freedom, justice, and opportunity. That is why the United States and Taiwan have been such natural partners over the decades. Even as we deal with the People's Republic of China, we must continue to stand with our friends in Taiwan. Again, I am delighted that Dr. Tsai Ing-wen is the first female President of Taiwan. Perhaps we will follow suit in November with the first woman President. This resolution reaffirms just how important that relationship is; and as Taiwan moves forward with this week's political transition, that country's people should know that they have an enduring friend in the United States. [[Page H2397]] Again, I commend Mr. Chabot for his insight in putting forward this resolution. I thank our chairman. I support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their wonderful leadership for many years on the issue of strengthening U.S.-Taiwan relations. I also want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), my dear friend, for authoring this important resolution of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. H. Con. Res. 88 reaffirms the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances as the cornerstones of U.S.-Taiwan relations, guidelines to which there should be no doubt about the commitment of the United States to our neighbor. In January, Taiwan once again demonstrated that it is one of the world's strongest and most vibrant democracies, a great partner, and I congratulate President-elect Tsai on her tremendous election and all of the people of Taiwan on their continued democratic success. Taiwan is truly a beacon of freedom in the Pacific, serving as an inspiration for those still suffering under repressive regimes, and is living proof of what can be achieved with liberty and self-government, principles that undergird both of our nations and form the foundation for our mutual stability, for our security, for our prosperity. As Taiwan's neighbor China continues raising tensions in the region, it is crucial that the United States provide Taiwan with the capability to defend herself against Chinese aggression, whether that aggression is political in nature, economic, or military. Both China and Taiwan must know that our commitment to Taiwan has not wavered one bit. Taiwan is an essential U.S. ally. It is our friend. It is our partner. I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), my friend, for authoring this resolution, for reaffirming our commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act, to the Six Assurances, and to the Taiwanese people here today. The United States will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with Taiwan. I look forward, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman, and ranking member, to even greater cooperation and friendship with Taiwan in the years ahead. I thank the gentleman for the time, and I thank the ranking member for his leadership and Mr. Chabot for authoring this important resolution. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Con. Res. 88 and its effects on U.S. foreign relations. Since 1979, the United States has enjoyed a friendly and productive relationship that has been supported by the passage of the Taiwan Relations Act and Six Assurances. The Taiwan Relations Act was a monumental piece of legislation that is directly responsible for fostering the longstanding friendship between the United States and Taiwan. The Six Assurances also played a significant role, setting the principles by which the United States would mediate its relationship with Taiwan and China. As security concerns have increased in the South Pacific, our allies in the region have contributed significantly to the safety and economic growth of the region. As a member of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, I am continually supportive of efforts to strengthen the friendship between our two countries. I would like to commend Congressman Chabot, Chairman Royce, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their leadership on this issue and their continued efforts in championing the close ties we have with Taiwan. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this measure so we can continue to ensure a bright future for both Taiwan and for the United States. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As one of the coauthors of this legislation, I really want to thank Representative Chabot for introducing this measure and for being a longtime champion on Taiwan, especially as he was chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific last Congress. I want to thank Mr. Engel as well for his efforts on this legislation. We have a commitment to democracy, and we share that with Taiwan. We share this commitment to the rule of law, to human rights. Frankly, Taiwan serves as an example of what can be built based upon these shared principles, and so do we. I think the Six Assurances are a critical element of U.S.-Taiwan policy, but obviously they are not consistently referenced or referred to as a cornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan policy alongside the Taiwan Relations Act, which is considered that cornerstone. Passage of H. Con. Res. 88 will put that longstanding verbal agreement onto paper, and, in turn, it will call on the administration and future administrations in unambiguous terms to publicly abide by the assurances offered by President Reagan. Taiwan is one of America's closest friends, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Con. Res. 88. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 88, reaffirming the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances as the cornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan relations. As a co-Chair of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, I want to thank my colleague and founding co-Chair of the Taiwan Caucus, Steve Chabot, for introducing this measure. When discussing the origins, stakeholders, and impact of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), it is important to note the significant role Congress played in amending the draft legislation the Executive Branch proposed for the maintenance of unofficial relations with Taiwan. I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for working with me on an amendment to H. Con. Res. 88 that credits Congress with significantly strengthening the TRA and the codified U.S. commitment to Taiwan. The draft legislative text proposed by the Executive Branch published in the March 1979 Department of State Bulletin included three simple titles to provide the legal authority for the maintenance of commercial, cultural, and other relations with Taiwan. However, the Taiwan Relations Act enacted into law bears little resemblance to the text published in the March 1979 Bulletin. Through the legislative process in both the House of Representatives and Senate, Congress left its mark on our enduring commitment to Taiwan in several ways, most notably by adding the security commitments made in Section 2(b)(5) and Section 3 of the TRA. The U.S. and Taiwan have since developed a dynamic relationship based on our shared values, deep economic ties, security relationship, and a history of bilateral collaboration. It is in the tradition of Congressional stewardship of the U.S.- Taiwan relationship that I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 88. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 88, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution, as amended, was agreed to. The title of the concurrent resolution was amended so as to read: ``Concurrent resolution reaffirming the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances as cornerstones of United States-Taiwan relations.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2395-H2397] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REAFFIRMATION OF THE TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT AND THE SIX ASSURANCES Mr. ROYCE.

As a longtime supporter of Taiwan, as I mentioned, I believe that the U.S.-Taiwan relationship is absolutely vital to the security and sustainability not just of Taiwan, but of the whole region. Taiwan is a close ally, one that truly believes and practices freedom and democracy. We witnessed this firsthand this past January, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, when the people of Taiwan held democratic national elections resulting in the election of Tsai Ing- wen. I want to congratulate her and wish her best wishes in her role as President of Taiwan. Taiwan elects their people democratically, unlike the PRC right across the Taiwan Strait. As we know, China has been bullying Taiwan for many years now. It is unfortunate that the PRC, China, doesn't follow, as an example, the people of Taiwan, who democratically elect their leaders. {time} 1630 Taiwan faces an unrelenting threat from China, which has nearly 1,600 ballistic missiles aimed at this small island. I remember when I came to Congress about 20 years ago, we talked about how scary it was that there were a couple hundred, 200 or 300 missiles aimed at Taiwan at that time. That has increased over the years to 1,600 missiles aimed at Taiwan from China. Although Taiwan enjoys de facto independence, China's ultimate goal is to take over Taiwan, to annex Taiwan, whatever the people of Taiwan believe. We absolutely cannot let that happen. China's ultimate goal, as I say, is the annexation of the island. We have all seen the growing hostilities in the East China Sea and South China Sea over the last couple years. I believe that this legislation underscores the point that the Taiwan Strait continues to be one of the potential flash points on the globe. We have seen China literally building islands and then militarizing those islands, much to the chagrin of all their neighbors in the region, from Japan to Vietnam, to Taiwan, to the Philippines, and on and on. That is what the PRC, China, has been up to. Any sort of solution between China and Taiwan should be reached in a peaceful and fair manner and only with the agreement of the people of Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, April 10, 2016, marked the 37th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act, the TRA. This act codifies into law an institutional framework and legal basis for continued interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, and it serves to maintain peace and stability in the western Pacific. When President Ronald Reagan agreed to sign the U.S.-China third communique in 1982, he was aware of the communique's effect on Taiwan and fully recognized that Taiwan needed to be reassured that they would not be abandoned--and they will not be abandoned--by the United States. In order to reinforce American support for Taiwan, the United States issued the Six Assurances. The Six Assurances provided a framework for sustaining the unique relationship between the United States and our ally, Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, they are as valid today as they were back in 1982. They rightfully function along with the TRA, as cornerstones of U.S.-Taiwan relations. I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker, it is important that the democracies of the world stand together to help strengthen freedom, justice, and opportunity. That is why the United States and Taiwan have been such natural partners over the decades. Even as we deal with the People's Republic of China, we must continue to stand with our friends in Taiwan. Again, I am delighted that Dr. Tsai Ing-wen is the first female President of Taiwan. Perhaps we will follow suit in November with the first woman President. This resolution reaffirms just how important that relationship is; and as Taiwan moves forward with this week's political transition, that country's people should know that they have an enduring friend in the United States. [[Page H2397]] Again, I commend Mr. Chabot for his insight in putting forward this resolution. I thank our chairman. I support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their wonderful leadership for many years on the issue of strengthening U.S.-Taiwan relations. I also want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), my dear friend, for authoring this important resolution of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. H. Con. Res. 88 reaffirms the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances as the cornerstones of U.S.-Taiwan relations, guidelines to which there should be no doubt about the commitment of the United States to our neighbor. In January, Taiwan once again demonstrated that it is one of the world's strongest and most vibrant democracies, a great partner, and I congratulate President-elect Tsai on her tremendous election and all of the people of Taiwan on their continued democratic success. Taiwan is truly a beacon of freedom in the Pacific, serving as an inspiration for those still suffering under repressive regimes, and is living proof of what can be achieved with liberty and self-government, principles that undergird both of our nations and form the foundation for our mutual stability, for our security, for our prosperity. As Taiwan's neighbor China continues raising tensions in the region, it is crucial that the United States provide Taiwan with the capability to defend herself against Chinese aggression, whether that aggression is political in nature, economic, or military. Both China and Taiwan must know that our commitment to Taiwan has not wavered one bit. Taiwan is an essential U.S. ally. It is our friend. It is our partner. I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), my friend, for authoring this resolution, for reaffirming our commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act, to the Six Assurances, and to the Taiwanese people here today. The United States will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with Taiwan. I look forward, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman, and ranking member, to even greater cooperation and friendship with Taiwan in the years ahead. I thank the gentleman for the time, and I thank the ranking member for his leadership and Mr. Chabot for authoring this important resolution. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Con. Res. 88 and its effects on U.S. foreign relations. Since 1979, the United States has enjoyed a friendly and productive relationship that has been supported by the passage of the Taiwan Relations Act and Six Assurances. The Taiwan Relations Act was a monumental piece of legislation that is directly responsible for fostering the longstanding friendship between the United States and Taiwan. The Six Assurances also played a significant role, setting the principles by which the United States would mediate its relationship with Taiwan and China. As security concerns have increased in the South Pacific, our allies in the region have contributed significantly to the safety and economic growth of the region. As a member of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, I am continually supportive of efforts to strengthen the friendship between our two countries. I would like to commend Congressman Chabot, Chairman Royce, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their leadership on this issue and their continued efforts in championing the close ties we have with Taiwan. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this measure so we can continue to ensure a bright future for both Taiwan and for the United States. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As one of the coauthors of this legislation, I really want to thank Representative Chabot for introducing this measure and for being a longtime champion on Taiwan, especially as he was chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific last Congress. I want to thank Mr. Engel as well for his efforts on this legislation. We have a commitment to democracy, and we share that with Taiwan. We share this commitment to the rule of law, to human rights. Frankly, Taiwan serves as an example of what can be built based upon these shared principles, and so do we. I think the Six Assurances are a critical element of U.S.-Taiwan policy, but obviously they are not consistently referenced or referred to as a cornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan policy alongside the Taiwan Relations Act, which is considered that cornerstone. Passage of H. Con. Res. 88 will put that longstanding verbal agreement onto paper, and, in turn, it will call on the administration and future administrations in unambiguous terms to publicly abide by the assurances offered by President Reagan. Taiwan is one of America's closest friends, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Con. Res. 88. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 88, reaffirming the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances as the cornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan relations. As a co-Chair of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, I want to thank my colleague and founding co-Chair of the Taiwan Caucus, Steve Chabot, for introducing this measure. When discussing the origins, stakeholders, and impact of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), it is important to note the significant role Congress played in amending the draft legislation the Executive Branch proposed for the maintenance of unofficial relations with Taiwan. I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for working with me on an amendment to H. Con. Res. 88 that credits Congress with significantly strengthening the TRA and the codified U.S. commitment to Taiwan. The draft legislative text proposed by the Executive Branch published in the March 1979 Department of State Bulletin included three simple titles to provide the legal authority for the maintenance of commercial, cultural, and other relations with Taiwan. However, the Taiwan Relations Act enacted into law bears little resemblance to the text published in the March 1979 Bulletin. Through the legislative process in both the House of Representatives and Senate, Congress left its mark on our enduring commitment to Taiwan in several ways, most notably by adding the security commitments made in Section 2(b)(5) and Section 3 of the TRA. The U.S. and Taiwan have since developed a dynamic relationship based on our shared values, deep economic ties, security relationship, and a history of bilateral collaboration. It is in the tradition of Congressional stewardship of the U.S.- Taiwan relationship that I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 88. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 88, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution, as amended, was agreed to. The title of the concurrent resolution was amended so as to read: ``Concurrent resolution reaffirming the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances as cornerstones of United States-Taiwan relations.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2395-H2397] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REAFFIRMATION OF THE TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT AND THE SIX ASSURANCES Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 88) reaffirming the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances as the cornerstone of United States-Taiwan relations, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: H. Con. Res. 88 Whereas the Cold War years cemented the close friendship between the United States and Taiwan, with Taiwan as an anti- Communist ally in the Asia-Pacific; Whereas United States economic aid prevented Taiwan from sliding into an economic depression in the 1950s and greatly contributed to the island's later economic takeoff; Whereas Taiwan has flourished to become a beacon of democracy in Asia and leading trade partner for the United States, and the relationship has endured for more than 65 years through many shifts in Asia's geopolitical landscape; Whereas the strong relationship between the United States and Taiwan is based on mutually beneficial security, commercial, and cultural ties; Whereas Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Susan Thornton stated in her testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on February 11, 2016, that ``The people on Taiwan have built a prosperous, free, and orderly society with strong institutions, worthy of emulation and envy''; Whereas Deputy Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken stated on March 29, 2016, that with Taiwan's January 2016 elections, ``the people of Taiwan showed the world again what a mature, Chinese-speaking democracy looks like''; Whereas on January 1, 1979, when the Carter Administration established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC), it ended formal diplomatic ties with the Republic of China on Taiwan; Whereas, the United States Congress acted swiftly to reaffirm the United States-Taiwan relationship with the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act just 100 days later, ensuring the United States maintained a robust and enduring relationship with Taiwan; Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8) was enacted on April 10, 1979, codifying into law the basis for continued commercial, cultural, and other relations between the United States and Taiwan; Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted ``to help maintain peace, security, and stability in the Western Pacific'', which ``are in the political, security, and economic interests of the United States and are matters of international concern''; Whereas the United States Congress significantly strengthened the draft legislation originally submitted by the Executive Branch to include provisions concerning Taiwan's security in the Taiwan Relations Act; Whereas then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kin Moy stated in his written testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 14, 2014, that, ``Our enduring relationship under the Taiwan Relations Act represents a unique asset for the United States and is an important multiplier of our influence in the region'', and credited the Taiwan Relations Act for having ``played such a key part in protecting Taiwan's freedom of action and U.S. interests the last 35 years in the Asia-Pacific area''; Whereas then-Special Assistant to the President and National Security Council Senior Director for Asian Affairs Evan Medeiros noted on March 28, 2014 that the Taiwan Relations Act was ``an enduring expression to the people of Taiwan about our commitment to their well-being, their security, their economic autonomy, and their international space''; Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act states ``the United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means''; Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act states that it is the policy of the United States to ``provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character'' and ``to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan''; Whereas each successive United States Administration since the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act has provided arms of a defensive character to Taiwan; Whereas a 2015 Department of Defense report to Congress on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China stated that, ``Preparing for potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait remains the focus and primary driver of China's military investment''; Whereas the United States has an abiding interest in the preservation of cross-Strait peace and stability, and in peace and stability in the entire Asia-Pacific region; Whereas on July 14, 1982, as the United States negotiated with the People's Republic of China over the wording of a joint communique' related to United States arms sales to Taiwan, President Ronald Reagan instructed his representative in Taiwan, American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Director James R. Lilley, to relay a set of assurances to Taiwan's then- President Chiang Ching-kuo; Whereas in House and Senate testimony immediately after the issuance of the August 17, 1982, Joint Communique' with the PRC, then-Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs John H. Holdridge stated on behalf of the Executive Branch that-- (1) ``. . .[W]e did not agree to set a date certain for ending arms sales to Taiwan''; (2) ``. . .[W]e see no mediation role for the United States'' between Taiwan and the PRC; (3) ``. . .[N]or will we attempt to exert pressure on Taiwan to enter into negotiations with the PRC''; (4) ``. . .[T]here has been no change in our longstanding position on the issue of sovereignty over Taiwan''; (5) ``We have no plans to seek'' revisions to the Taiwan Relations Act; and (6) the August 17 Communique', ``should not be read to imply that we have agreed to engage in prior consultations with Beijing on arms sales to Taiwan''; Whereas these assurances, first delivered to Taiwan's president by AIT Director Lilley, have come to be known as the Six Assurances; Whereas in testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on October 4, 2011, then-Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell stated that, ``[The] Taiwan Relations Act, plus the so-called Six Assurances and Three Communique's, form the foundation of our overall approach'', to relations with Taiwan; and Whereas in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 3, 2014, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel R. Russel stated that the Six Assurances ``continue to play an important part as an element of our approach to Taiwan and the situation across the strait'': Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That Congress-- (1) affirms that the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances are both cornerstones of United States relations with Taiwan; and (2) urges the President and Department of State to affirm the Six Assurances publicly, proactively, and consistently as a cornerstone of United States-Taiwan relations. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 88. I would like to recognize Mr. Chabot for his longstanding dedication and support for the people of Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, Taiwan has always been a strong friend and critical ally to the United States. Congress has been central to this relationship, championing a strong relationship with Taiwan through landmark measures like the Taiwan Relations Act and through pressing successive administrations to fulfill their obligation to sell defensive arms to Taiwan. Taiwan is now the United States' ninth largest trading partner, and it is in the U.S.' interest to have a stable and a prosperous Taiwan. It is an exciting time in Taiwan. In January, a free and fair election once again demonstrated the strength and vibrancy of Taiwan's democratic system. And in 3 days, we expect the newly elected President to be inaugurated in a peaceful transfer of power from one party to another. The people of Taiwan should be proud of their prosperous, free, and democratic society and what they have been able to accomplish, despite having to face countless challenges outside of their control. Mr. Speaker, when the U.S. established diplomatic relations with the [[Page H2396]] People's Republic of China on January 1, 1979, the U.S. Congress acted just 100 days later to pass the Taiwan Relations Act, which would ensure that the United States maintained a robust and enduring relationship with Taiwan. Three years later, in 1982, President Reagan deepened the U.S. commitment to Taiwan by issuing the Six Assurances to Taiwan, which included treating Taiwan as we would treat any one of our allies when making decisions on defensive arms sales, not setting a date for termination of arms sales, and not altering the Taiwan Relations Act. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is especially important when it comes to the Six Assurances. When the Reagan administration delivered the Six Assurances, it was by way of a verbal agreement and has largely remained as such since 1982. Today, by passing this resolution, Congress is going on record that the cornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan policy is not only the Taiwan Relations Act, but also the Six Assurances. This important measure solidifies President Reagan's commitment to Taiwan and urges this administration and the ones that follow to publicly, proactively, and consistently take the Six Assurances into account when handling United States-Taiwan relations. I am proud that in the 114th Congress we have already passed legislation which supports Taiwan's inclusion in INTERPOL and that we are now also passing a measure which will reassure our friends in Taiwan and press the administration to continue to abide by the Six Assurances. I am also proud that maintaining a strong relationship with Taiwan continues to be a bipartisan issue. I appreciate Mr. Eliot Engel's support on this initiative, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Let me say that, by passing this resolution, we, the United States Congress, are yet again taking another step toward strengthening the U.S.-Taiwan partnership. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this resolution. Let me once again thank Chairman Ed Royce and our colleague from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who introduced this measure. At the end of this week, Taiwan will swear in a new President, marking another peaceful democratic transition in that country. I have had the pleasure of meeting the President-elect, Dr. Tsai Ing-wen, several times as well as the country's outgoing leader, President Ma. And though they represent different political parties, it is clear that they are both fully committed to Taiwan's vibrant democracy and open society. Those values are also at the root of the close ties between the United States and Taiwan. This resolution affirms our commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances. These are the measures that have underpinned our relationship with the Taiwanese people since we normalized relations with the People's Republic of China. As Taiwan prepares for this week's political transition, it is vital that the United States send a clear signal that we continue to stand with the people of Taiwan on a range of issues, from Taiwan's defense to its growing role on the global stage, to its commitment to freedom and democracy. So I am happy to support this measure. We should continue to stand with our partners in Taiwan, and I wish the people of Taiwan well as they swear in a new President this week. I might add, it is the first woman President of Taiwan. I urge support for this resolution. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot). He is chairman of the Small Business Committee, a senior member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the author of this measure. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 88. I was one of the original founders of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus. It was a bipartisan group of people who founded it. I have been the chairman of the Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. I have been a longtime friend of Taiwan. I have been there probably a dozen times over the years. This important legislation reaffirms the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances as cornerstones of U.S.-Taiwan relations.

move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (h. con. res. 88) reaffirming the taiwan relations act and the six assurances as the cornerstone of united states-taiwan relations, as amended. the clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. the text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: h. con. res. 88 whereas the cold war years cemented the close friendship between the united states and taiwan, with taiwan as an anti- communist ally in the asia-pacific; whereas united states economic aid prevented taiwan from sliding into an economic depression in the 1950s and greatly contributed to the island's later economic takeoff; whereas taiwan has flourished to become a beacon of democracy in asia and leading trade partner for the united states, and the relationship has endured for more than 65 years through many shifts in asia's geopolitical landscape; whereas the strong relationship between the united states and taiwan is based on mutually beneficial security, commercial, and cultural ties; whereas deputy assistant secretary of state susan thornton stated in her testimony before the house foreign affairs committee on february 11, 2016, that ``the people on taiwan have built a prosperous, free, and orderly society with strong institutions, worthy of emulation and envy''; whereas deputy secretary of state antony j. blinken stated on march 29, 2016, that with taiwan's january 2016 elections, ``the people of taiwan showed the world again what a mature, chinese-speaking democracy looks like''; whereas on january 1, 1979, when the carter administration established diplomatic relations with the people's republic of china (prc), it ended formal diplomatic ties with the republic of china on taiwan; whereas, the united states congress acted swiftly to reaffirm the united states-taiwan relationship with the enactment of the taiwan relations act just 100 days later, ensuring the united states maintained a robust and enduring relationship with taiwan; whereas the taiwan relations act (public law 96-8) was enacted on april 10, 1979, codifying into law the basis for continued commercial, cultural, and other relations between the united states and taiwan; whereas the taiwan relations act was enacted ``to help maintain peace, security, and stability in the western pacific'', which ``are in the political, security, and economic interests of the united states and are matters of international concern''; whereas the united states congress significantly strengthened the draft legislation originally submitted by the executive branch to include provisions concerning taiwan's security in the taiwan relations act; whereas then-deputy assistant secretary of state kin moy stated in his written testimony before the house foreign affairs committee on march 14, 2014, that, ``our enduring relationship under the taiwan relations act represents a unique asset for the united states and is an important multiplier of our influence in the region'', and credited the taiwan relations act for having ``played such a key part in protecting taiwan's freedom of action and u.s. interests the last 35 years in the asia-pacific area''; whereas then-special assistant to the president and national security council senior director for asian affairs evan medeiros noted on march 28, 2014 that the taiwan relations act was ``an enduring expression to the people of taiwan about our commitment to their well-being, their security, their economic autonomy, and their international space''; whereas the taiwan relations act states ``the united states decision to establish diplomatic relations with the people's republic of china rests upon the expectation that the future of taiwan will be determined by peaceful means''; whereas the taiwan relations act states that it is the policy of the united states to ``provide taiwan with arms of a defensive character'' and ``to maintain the capacity of the united states to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on taiwan''; whereas each successive united states administration since the enactment of the taiwan relations act has provided arms of a defensive character to taiwan; whereas a 2015 department of defense report to congress on military and security developments involving the people's republic of china stated that, ``preparing for potential conflict in the taiwan strait remains the focus and primary driver of china's military investment''; whereas the united states has an abiding interest in the preservation of cross-strait peace and stability, and in peace and stability in the entire asia-pacific region; whereas on july 14, 1982, as the united states negotiated with the people's republic of china over the wording of a joint communique' related to united states arms sales to taiwan, president ronald reagan instructed his representative in taiwan, american institute in taiwan (ait) director james r. lilley, to relay a set of assurances to taiwan's then- president chiang ching-kuo; whereas in house and senate testimony immediately after the issuance of the august 17, 1982, joint communique' with the prc, then-assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs john h. holdridge stated on behalf of the executive branch that-- (1) ``. . .[w]e did not agree to set a date certain for ending arms sales to taiwan''; (2) ``. . .[w]e see no mediation role for the united states'' between taiwan and the prc; (3) ``. . .[n]or will we attempt to exert pressure on taiwan to enter into negotiations with the prc''; (4) ``. . .[t]here has been no change in our longstanding position on the issue of sovereignty over taiwan''; (5) ``we have no plans to seek'' revisions to the taiwan relations act; and (6) the august 17 communique', ``should not be read to imply that we have agreed to engage in prior consultations with beijing on arms sales to taiwan''; whereas these assurances, first delivered to taiwan's president by ait director lilley, have come to be known as the six assurances; whereas in testimony before the house foreign affairs committee on october 4, 2011, then-assistant secretary of state kurt campbell stated that, ``[the] taiwan relations act, plus the so-called six assurances and three communique's, form the foundation of our overall approach'', to relations with taiwan; and whereas in testimony before the senate foreign relations committee on april 3, 2014, assistant secretary of state daniel r. russel stated that the six assurances ``continue to play an important part as an element of our approach to taiwan and the situation across the strait'': now, therefore, be it resolved by the house of representatives (the senate concurring), that congress-- (1) affirms that the taiwan relations act and the six assurances are both cornerstones of united states relations with taiwan; and (2) urges the president and department of state to affirm the six assurances publicly, proactively, and consistently as a cornerstone of united states-taiwan relations. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from california (mr. royce) and the gentleman from new york (mr. engel) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. general leave mr. royce. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the record. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in strong support of h. con. res. 88. i would like to recognize mr. chabot for his longstanding dedication and support for the people of taiwan. mr. speaker, taiwan has always been a strong friend and critical ally to the united states. congress has been central to this relationship, championing a strong relationship with taiwan through landmark measures like the taiwan relations act and through pressing successive administrations to fulfill their obligation to sell defensive arms to taiwan. taiwan is now the united states' ninth largest trading partner, and it is in the u.s.' interest to have a stable and a prosperous taiwan. it is an exciting time in taiwan. in january, a free and fair election once again demonstrated the strength and vibrancy of taiwan's democratic system. and in 3 days, we expect the newly elected president to be inaugurated in a peaceful transfer of power from one party to another. the people of taiwan should be proud of their prosperous, free, and democratic society and what they have been able to accomplish, despite having to face countless challenges outside of their control. mr. speaker, when the u.s. established diplomatic relations with the [[page h2396]] people's republic of china on january 1, 1979, the u.s. congress acted just 100 days later to pass the taiwan relations act, which would ensure that the united states maintained a robust and enduring relationship with taiwan. three years later, in 1982, president reagan deepened the u.s. commitment to taiwan by issuing the six assurances to taiwan, which included treating taiwan as we would treat any one of our allies when making decisions on defensive arms sales, not setting a date for termination of arms sales, and not altering the taiwan relations act. mr. speaker, this legislation is especially important when it comes to the six assurances. when the reagan administration delivered the six assurances, it was by way of a verbal agreement and has largely remained as such since 1982. today, by passing this resolution, congress is going on record that the cornerstone of u.s.-taiwan policy is not only the taiwan relations act, but also the six assurances. this important measure solidifies president reagan's commitment to taiwan and urges this administration and the ones that follow to publicly, proactively, and consistently take the six assurances into account when handling united states-taiwan relations. i am proud that in the 114th congress we have already passed legislation which supports taiwan's inclusion in interpol and that we are now also passing a measure which will reassure our friends in taiwan and press the administration to continue to abide by the six assurances. i am also proud that maintaining a strong relationship with taiwan continues to be a bipartisan issue. i appreciate mr. eliot engel's support on this initiative, the ranking member of the foreign affairs committee. let me say that, by passing this resolution, we, the united states congress, are yet again taking another step toward strengthening the u.s.-taiwan partnership. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of this resolution. let me once again thank chairman ed royce and our colleague from ohio (mr. chabot), who introduced this measure. at the end of this week, taiwan will swear in a new president, marking another peaceful democratic transition in that country. i have had the pleasure of meeting the president-elect, dr. tsai ing-wen, several times as well as the country's outgoing leader, president ma. and though they represent different political parties, it is clear that they are both fully committed to taiwan's vibrant democracy and open society. those values are also at the root of the close ties between the united states and taiwan. this resolution affirms our commitment to the taiwan relations act and the six assurances. these are the measures that have underpinned our relationship with the taiwanese people since we normalized relations with the people's republic of china. as taiwan prepares for this week's political transition, it is vital that the united states send a clear signal that we continue to stand with the people of taiwan on a range of issues, from taiwan's defense to its growing role on the global stage, to its commitment to freedom and democracy. so i am happy to support this measure. we should continue to stand with our partners in taiwan, and i wish the people of taiwan well as they swear in a new president this week. i might add, it is the first woman president of taiwan. i urge support for this resolution. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from ohio (mr. chabot). he is chairman of the small business committee, a senior member of the committee on foreign affairs, and the author of this measure. mr. chabot. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h. con. res. 88. i was one of the original founders of the congressional taiwan caucus. it was a bipartisan group of people who founded it. i have been the chairman of the foreign affairs' subcommittee on asia and the pacific. i have been a longtime friend of taiwan. i have been there probably a dozen times over the years. this important legislation reaffirms the taiwan relations act and the six assurances as cornerstones of u.s.-taiwan relations. as a longtime supporter of taiwan, as i mentioned, i believe that the u.s.-taiwan relationship is absolutely vital to the security and sustainability not just of taiwan, but of the whole region. taiwan is a close ally, one that truly believes and practices freedom and democracy. we witnessed this firsthand this past january, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, when the people of taiwan held democratic national elections resulting in the election of tsai ing- wen. i want to congratulate her and wish her best wishes in her role as president of taiwan. taiwan elects their people democratically, unlike the prc right across the taiwan strait. as we know, china has been bullying taiwan for many years now. it is unfortunate that the prc, china, doesn't follow, as an example, the people of taiwan, who democratically elect their leaders. {time} 1630 taiwan faces an unrelenting threat from china, which has nearly 1,600 ballistic missiles aimed at this small island. i remember when i came to congress about 20 years ago, we talked about how scary it was that there were a couple hundred, 200 or 300 missiles aimed at taiwan at that time. that has increased over the years to 1,600 missiles aimed at taiwan from china. although taiwan enjoys de facto independence, china's ultimate goal is to take over taiwan, to annex taiwan, whatever the people of taiwan believe. we absolutely cannot let that happen. china's ultimate goal, as i say, is the annexation of the island. we have all seen the growing hostilities in the east china sea and south china sea over the last couple years. i believe that this legislation underscores the point that the taiwan strait continues to be one of the potential flash points on the globe. we have seen china literally building islands and then militarizing those islands, much to the chagrin of all their neighbors in the region, from japan to vietnam, to taiwan, to the philippines, and on and on. that is what the prc, china, has been up to. any sort of solution between china and taiwan should be reached in a peaceful and fair manner and only with the agreement of the people of taiwan. mr. speaker, april 10, 2016, marked the 37th anniversary of the enactment of the taiwan relations act, the tra. this act codifies into law an institutional framework and legal basis for continued interaction between the u.s. and taiwan, and it serves to maintain peace and stability in the western pacific. when president ronald reagan agreed to sign the u.s.-china third communique in 1982, he was aware of the communique's effect on taiwan and fully recognized that taiwan needed to be reassured that they would not be abandoned--and they will not be abandoned--by the united states. in order to reinforce american support for taiwan, the united states issued the six assurances. the six assurances provided a framework for sustaining the unique relationship between the united states and our ally, taiwan. mr. speaker, they are as valid today as they were back in 1982. they rightfully function along with the tra, as cornerstones of u.s.-taiwan relations. i encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume to close. mr. speaker, it is important that the democracies of the world stand together to help strengthen freedom, justice, and opportunity. that is why the united states and taiwan have been such natural partners over the decades. even as we deal with the people's republic of china, we must continue to stand with our friends in taiwan. again, i am delighted that dr. tsai ing-wen is the first female president of taiwan. perhaps we will follow suit in november with the first woman president. this resolution reaffirms just how important that relationship is; and as taiwan moves forward with this week's political transition, that country's people should know that they have an enduring friend in the united states. [[page h2397]] again, i commend mr. chabot for his insight in putting forward this resolution. i thank our chairman. i support this measure. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of the committee on foreign affairs. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman and the ranking member for their wonderful leadership for many years on the issue of strengthening u.s.-taiwan relations. i also want to thank the gentleman from ohio (mr. chabot), my dear friend, for authoring this important resolution of which i am proud to be a cosponsor. h. con. res. 88 reaffirms the taiwan relations act and the six assurances as the cornerstones of u.s.-taiwan relations, guidelines to which there should be no doubt about the commitment of the united states to our neighbor. in january, taiwan once again demonstrated that it is one of the world's strongest and most vibrant democracies, a great partner, and i congratulate president-elect tsai on her tremendous election and all of the people of taiwan on their continued democratic success. taiwan is truly a beacon of freedom in the pacific, serving as an inspiration for those still suffering under repressive regimes, and is living proof of what can be achieved with liberty and self-government, principles that undergird both of our nations and form the foundation for our mutual stability, for our security, for our prosperity. as taiwan's neighbor china continues raising tensions in the region, it is crucial that the united states provide taiwan with the capability to defend herself against chinese aggression, whether that aggression is political in nature, economic, or military. both china and taiwan must know that our commitment to taiwan has not wavered one bit. taiwan is an essential u.s. ally. it is our friend. it is our partner. i thank the gentleman from ohio (mr. chabot), my friend, for authoring this resolution, for reaffirming our commitment to the taiwan relations act, to the six assurances, and to the taiwanese people here today. the united states will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with taiwan. i look forward, mr. speaker, mr. chairman, and ranking member, to even greater cooperation and friendship with taiwan in the years ahead. i thank the gentleman for the time, and i thank the ranking member for his leadership and mr. chabot for authoring this important resolution. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia (mr. carter). mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i rise today to support h. con. res. 88 and its effects on u.s. foreign relations. since 1979, the united states has enjoyed a friendly and productive relationship that has been supported by the passage of the taiwan relations act and six assurances. the taiwan relations act was a monumental piece of legislation that is directly responsible for fostering the longstanding friendship between the united states and taiwan. the six assurances also played a significant role, setting the principles by which the united states would mediate its relationship with taiwan and china. as security concerns have increased in the south pacific, our allies in the region have contributed significantly to the safety and economic growth of the region. as a member of the congressional taiwan caucus, i am continually supportive of efforts to strengthen the friendship between our two countries. i would like to commend congressman chabot, chairman royce, and the committee on foreign affairs for their leadership on this issue and their continued efforts in championing the close ties we have with taiwan. i encourage all of my colleagues to support this measure so we can continue to ensure a bright future for both taiwan and for the united states. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. as one of the coauthors of this legislation, i really want to thank representative chabot for introducing this measure and for being a longtime champion on taiwan, especially as he was chairman of the subcommittee on asia and the pacific last congress. i want to thank mr. engel as well for his efforts on this legislation. we have a commitment to democracy, and we share that with taiwan. we share this commitment to the rule of law, to human rights. frankly, taiwan serves as an example of what can be built based upon these shared principles, and so do we. i think the six assurances are a critical element of u.s.-taiwan policy, but obviously they are not consistently referenced or referred to as a cornerstone of u.s.-taiwan policy alongside the taiwan relations act, which is considered that cornerstone. passage of h. con. res. 88 will put that longstanding verbal agreement onto paper, and, in turn, it will call on the administration and future administrations in unambiguous terms to publicly abide by the assurances offered by president reagan. taiwan is one of america's closest friends, and i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting h. con. res. 88. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. connolly. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h. con. res. 88, reaffirming the taiwan relations act and the six assurances as the cornerstone of u.s.-taiwan relations. as a co-chair of the congressional taiwan caucus, i want to thank my colleague and founding co-chair of the taiwan caucus, steve chabot, for introducing this measure. when discussing the origins, stakeholders, and impact of the taiwan relations act (tra), it is important to note the significant role congress played in amending the draft legislation the executive branch proposed for the maintenance of unofficial relations with taiwan. i want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the house foreign affairs committee for working with me on an amendment to h. con. res. 88 that credits congress with significantly strengthening the tra and the codified u.s. commitment to taiwan. the draft legislative text proposed by the executive branch published in the march 1979 department of state bulletin included three simple titles to provide the legal authority for the maintenance of commercial, cultural, and other relations with taiwan. however, the taiwan relations act enacted into law bears little resemblance to the text published in the march 1979 bulletin. through the legislative process in both the house of representatives and senate, congress left its mark on our enduring commitment to taiwan in several ways, most notably by adding the security commitments made in section 2(b)(5) and section 3 of the tra. the u.s. and taiwan have since developed a dynamic relationship based on our shared values, deep economic ties, security relationship, and a history of bilateral collaboration. it is in the tradition of congressional stewardship of the u.s.- taiwan relationship that i urge my colleagues to support h. con. res. 88. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from california (mr. royce) that the house suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, h. con. res. 88, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution, as amended, was agreed to. the title of the concurrent resolution was amended so as to read: ``concurrent resolution reaffirming the taiwan relations act and the six assurances as cornerstones of united states-taiwan relations.''. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",24878

(a) In General.--Section 101 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6411) is amended-- (1) in subsection (b), by adding at the end before the period the following: ``, and shall report directly to the Secretary of State''; (2) in subsection (c)-- [[Page H2400]] (A) in paragraph (1)-- (i) by striking ``responsibility'' and inserting ``responsibilities''; (ii) by striking ``shall be to advance'' and inserting the following: ``shall be to-- ``(A) advance''; (iii) in subparagraph (A) (as so added), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (iv) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(B) integrate United States international religious freedom policies and strategies into the foreign policy efforts of the United States.''; (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``the principal adviser to'' before ``the Secretary of State''; (C) in paragraph (3)-- (i) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end; (ii) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (iii) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(C) contacts with nongovernmental organizations that have an impact on the state of religious freedom in their respective societies or regions, or internationally.''; (D) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and (E) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new paragraph: ``(4) Coordination responsibilities.--In order to promote religious freedom as an interest of United States foreign policy, the Ambassador at Large-- ``(A) shall coordinate international religious freedom policies across all programs, projects, and activities of the United States; and ``(B) should participate in any interagency processes on issues in which the promotion of international religious freedom policy can advance United States national security interests, including in democracy promotion, stability, security, and development globally.''; and (3) in subsection (d), by striking ``staff for the Office'' and all that follows through the period at the end and inserting ``individuals to fill at least 25 full-time equivalent staff positions, and any other temporary staff positions as needed to compile, edit, and manage the Annual Report under the direct supervision of the Ambassador at Large, and for the conduct of investigations by the Office and for necessary travel to carry out the provisions of this Act. The Secretary of State should also provide to the Ambassador at Large funds that are sufficient to carry out the duties described in this section, including as necessary representation funds, in amounts comparable to those provided to other Ambassadors at Large in the Department of State.''. (b) Sense of Congress.--Because international religious freedom is a vital foreign policy interest and one that needs coordination across many regional bureaus and among Special Envoys and Special Representatives with overlapping mandates, the Secretary of State should consider elevating the office of International Religious Freedom and the position of the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom to the Office of the Secretary, similar to other Ambassador-at- Large positions that now report directly to the Secretary. Providing the Office of International Religious Freedom with additional resources and status will demonstrate both the strategic importance of international religious freedom policy within the State Department bureaucracy and show persecuted religious groups globally that the U.S. gives priority to the protection and promotion of international religious freedom as mandated by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today, 18 years after enactment of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, the right to believe and practice one's faith remains under threat around the world. The threats come not just from authoritarian regimes obsessed with control, such as North Korea, Iran, or Vietnam, which were the focus of that law, but also from lethal terrorist groups. Two months ago this Chamber made history by declaring that the so- called Islamic State, or ISIS, is committing genocide against religious and ethnic minorities. It has committed mass murder, beheadings, rape, torture, slavery, and the kidnapping of children, among many other atrocities. ISIS dynamites churches and flattens ancient monasteries, hoping to erase the very existence of religious groups that disagree with their brutal world view. Boko Haram in Nigeria and al Shabaab in East Africa are also responsible for their own deadly persecutions, both also linked to ISIS in their support for that terrorist movement. These groups have turned religious intolerance into a murderous force of global instability. The right to believe and practice according to the dictates of conscience is a direct challenge to their ideologies. Thus, religious freedom is not just a human rights issue; frankly, today, it is a global security issue. However, current law related to religious freedom, which focuses solely on governments of sovereign states, does not address this reality. Based on years of oversight and multiple hearings, H.R. 1150, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, updates the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to improve the coordination and effectiveness of U.S. efforts to promote religious liberty around the world and also expressly addresses the role of these non-state actors like ISIS. Introduced by Subcommittee Chairman Smith and Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, the bill was amended and agreed to by the Foreign Affairs Committee and has more than 115 bipartisan cosponsors. It is fitting that this bill is named in honor of our former colleague from Virginia, Frank Wolf, a tireless advocate for human rights and the author of the original International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which we are amending. By enhancing coordination, confronting non-state actors, and improving reporting and training, H.R. 1150 is a helpful refinement of our statutory commitment to combat religious persecution around the globe. It deserves our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC, May 13, 2016. Hon. Ed Royce, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing concerning H.R. 1150, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2016.

Let me again thank Chairman Ed Royce for bringing this bill forward. I also want to thank my friend, Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey, for his leadership and for authorizing this bill. Mr. Speaker, freedom of religion has been a bedrock principle of open and democratic societies for centuries. Some of the first immigrants to settle on American shores sailed here because they were fleeing religious persecution at home. This liberty is enshrined in our own founding documents, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in the charters of democracies all over the world. The freedom to worship as a person chooses or not to worship at all should be settled business and nobody's business but the person themselves. Yet, around the world religious communities endure discrimination, persecution, and violence. It is amazing to me that, when we look at the history of strife and war that has swirled around religious persecution, governments continue to deny this freedom to their own people. This assault on religious liberty holds societies back and undercuts progress. It obviously has no place in the 21st century. So for the United States and other countries that cherish freedom, it is not enough just to guarantee religious liberty to our own people. We need to speak out and act when we see this right under attack around the world. For that matter, we have a responsibility to speak out when we see any liberty under attack, whether freedom of the press, the right to organize, or the equality of LGBT persons. Mr. Smith's legislation would help ensure that promoting and supporting religious liberty are a component of American foreign policy. It would help ensure that our diplomats around the world understand the importance of this issue and are working to advance this freedom on the front lines. It is worth noting that we should also continue to fully fund the State Department's Human Rights and Democracy Fund, which helps address a range of human rights abuses around the world, including threats to our religious freedom. Together with this legislation, it sends a clear message to the world that protecting human rights is a priority for the United States. So I support this measure. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I again want to congratulate my friend Mr. Smith, who is so strong on issues like this and so forceful in pushing forward all the way until we finally got this on the floor of the House. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations, and the author of the bill. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Chairman Royce, for his leadership on this bill, the markup, and for the very timely recommendations he and staff made to improve it. I would like to thank Eliot Engel again for working hand in glove in a good, bipartisan effort to protect international religious freedom. As my good friend, Chairman Royce, noted a moment ago, 18 years ago Congress had the foresight to pass the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. That landmark bill, authored by Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia, made advancing the right to religious freedom a significant and profoundly serious U.S. foreign policy priority. Passage of the International Religious Freedom Act was not easy. There were determined opponents in Congress and in the Clinton administration. I know. I chaired the congressional hearings and the subcommittee markup. It was no cakewalk. But our opposition was overcome by the courage, tenacity, and vision of Frank Wolf, bolstered by a diverse, bipartisan, and ecumenical coalition of Members of Congress, ethnic minority and religions groups, and human rights organizations. That coalition has reassembled to support this bill today, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act. I want to especially thank Anna Eshoo, who is the principal Democratic sponsor of this legislation, for her leadership and for working particularly in the Middle East to combat the savagery that is being imposed upon people of minority faiths, including Christians. {time} 1700 I thank her for her leadership and, again, for being the principal Democrat on this bill. Let me just note that naming this bill after Frank Wolf, who I consider to be, and many of us consider to be the William Wilberforce of modern times, is an attempt to recognize his extraordinary life's work promoting human rights, 34 years as a Member of Congress, including, and especially, religious freedom. He now serves as the Wilson Chair at Baylor, again, continuing his lifesaving work for religious believers all over the world. He just returned from Nigeria and testified at our hearing last week. He was in the embattled states in northern Nigeria, where Boko Haram runs free, massacring people. He was there on a fact-finding mission to promote religious freedom. Mr. Speaker, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act that is before us is a series of upgrades to meet the challenges of the 21st century. We know that the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis of international religious freedom; a crisis that continues to create millions--no, tens of millions of victims; a crisis that undermines liberty, prosperity, and peace; a crisis that poses a direct challenge to the U.S. interests in the Middle East, Russia, China, Sub-Saharan Africa, and elsewhere in the world. The Pew Research Center notes that over 75 percent of the world's population today lives in countries where severe religious freedom abuses occur annually. According to Pew, instances of anti-Semitism are at a 7-year high. It is getting worse everywhere, particularly in the Middle East, but also in Europe and in the United States. Mr. Speaker, ancient Christian communities in Iraq and Syria are on the verge of extinction, and other religious minorities in the Middle East face a [[Page H2405]] constant assault from the Islamic State. Several weeks ago, this Congress passed a resolution, sponsored by Jeff Fortenberry, that was followed by a declaration by Secretary of State John Kerry, that said that ISIS has committed, and continues to commit genocide, mass atrocities and war crimes against Christians, Yazidis, and other minority faiths. We are on record. We know it is happening. We are speaking out. In a couple of weeks, I am chairing a hearing on what is next; what should we be doing next to combat this terrible, terrible crisis. In Nigeria, the Islamist terror group, Boko Haram, is believed to have killed over 6,600 people last year alone, mostly Christian, but there are Muslims as well who are being targeted. According to the testimony we received last week, since 2009, the number is about 15,000 year to date since 2009. Mr. Speaker, at one of those hearings a few years ago, I had a man named Habila. Habila, I met him at an IDP camp in Jos, Nigeria, where a lot of churches have been firebombed. He told me this story. He was credible, and it checked out. And he came to Congress and testified. Boko Haram put an AK-47--a terrorist--to his jaw and said: Renounce Christ or I will kill you. You must become a Muslim on the spot. Habila said: I am ready to meet my Lord. And this terrorist pulled the trigger and blew most of his face away. What courage, what faith for a man. And when he told the story, you could have heard a pin drop. Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom just released its 2016 annual report. And let me note, parenthetically, USCIRF, or that Commission, was also created by Chairman Wolf as part of IRFA, the original bill. They have found that the abuses committed by governments and non- state actors has ``deteriorated.'' ``The incarceration of prisoners of conscience''--they point out--``remains astonishingly widespread . . .'' They point out that ``Over the past year, the Chinese government''-- as just one of many examples--``has stepped up its persecution of religious groups''--across the board: Tibetans, Uighurs, Muslim Uighurs, Christians, and, of course, the Falun Gong. I spoke in mid-February at NYU, I gave a keynote there in Shanghai, and talked about how Xi Jinping, the President of China, is in a race to the bottom with North Korea to make religion absolutely subservient to the Communist Party. He calls it the sinification of religion; and what was already a bad situation has now become demonstrably worse. The Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act will upgrade the tools so that this administration, and subsequent ones, can do an even better job to try to mitigate and, hopefully, end religious persecution. It does this by, one, requiring that international religious freedom policies be integrated into national security, immigration, rule of law, and other relevant U.S. foreign policies. It creates a Designated Persons List of individuals sanctioned for participating in or directing religious freedom abuses. It expands diplomatic training on international religious freedoms for all State Department diplomats; creates a tier system for IRFA, for the reports, not just countries of particular concern, of which there are currently 10, but also those that are on a watch list, those that are bad and, perhaps, getting worse. It gives the President authority to designate non-state actors in addition to countries; and it also requires the Ambassador at Large to report directly to the Secretary of State. It also is increasingly clear that religious freedom diplomacy is really needed to advance U.S. interests around the world. This will do it. The legislation is backed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the International Religious Freedom Roundtable, a diverse and ecumenical group of individuals from the faith community. Finally, just let me thank Scott Flipse, who worked for Frank Wolf previously, then he worked for the International Religious Freedom Office at the State Department, and now is working at the China Commission; our General Counsel, Piero Tozzi; Janice Kaguyutan, I thank her for her work on this; and Sajit Gandhi. This is a true, bipartisan piece of legislation and, hopefully, the Senate will favorably receive it. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Again, Mr. Speaker, in closing, we focus on human rights as part of our foreign policy because it is the right thing to do. The United States is founded on the idea that an individual should be able to live according to his or her own beliefs. That is a value we want to see thriving around the world. Advancing human rights is also the smart thing to do. Countries with a strong respect for human rights are countries that prosper and play a constructive role on the global stage. I want to again say to my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), when he comes for advancing human rights, he takes a second seat to nobody. He is indefatigable when it comes to these things. In all the years I have known him, he has always been fair and honest. I really sincerely commend him, and know how heartfelt it is and how much we appreciate his hard work. When we see governments stifling religious freedom, or any freedom, we have a responsibility to speak out and make it clear that the United States remains a champion for these basic liberties. This bill helps us to live up to that responsibility, and I am proud to support it. I thank Chairman Royce and Mr. Smith. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), our esteemed colleague, who ably represents the district formerly served by Frank Wolf, who is honored in the title of this bill. Representative Barbara Comstock is a coauthor of this bill with Mr. Smith, and I thank them both. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, ask human rights and religious freedom advocates to name their most steadfast friend who has served on Capitol Hill over the years, and Representative Frank Wolf, my predecessor, is always on the short list, as are my colleagues here today. So I am honored today to stand in support of a bill I proudly cosponsored, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, named after the distinguished gentleman who served in this seat for the 10th District of Virginia, and as the co-chair of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, and a man whose deep faith and commitment to human rights and religion freedom were a large part of why he was known for years here and around the country, and even around the world, as the conscience of the Congress. He wrote a book, a powerful book, titled a ``Prisoner of Conscience,'' about his many trips over the years and how he fought for religious freedom; and I hope he doesn't mind if I recommend that book to our listeners here. We continue to be blessed with Congressman Wolf's passionate leadership as he leads the 21st Century Wilberforce Initiative to create a world where religious freedom is recognized by nations across the globe as a fundamental human right. Since leaving Congress, Mr. Wolf has continued to travel to the front lines to see, firsthand, the plight of ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria, including Christians, Yazidis, Kurds, and other minority religious groups. As previously mentioned, he has just returned from Nigeria. He continues to shine a light every day on the dark places where men and women and children, even, of faith are victimized, tortured and, tragically, even killed for their faith. He will not let the world look away, and we thank him for his continued work and his strong and much- needed voice. Now this legislation amends his own legislation to continue that mission that Mr. Wolf so valiantly fought for for 3 decades here in Congress. It will improve the ability of the United States to advance religious freedom globally, with stronger and more flexible political responses to a disturbing and growing denial of basic religious freedoms around the world. [[Page H2406]] As has been said by many, Frank Wolf is the William Wilberforce of our day. He is, and has always been, a voice for the voiceless. He once said: ``Most would agree that conscience rights figure prominently in the narrative of America's founding. Historically, Americans and our corresponding institutions have recognized that conscience is not ultimately allegiant to the state, but to something, and for many people, Someone, higher.'' I appreciate the opportunity today to continue that legacy with the passing of this important legislation which will continue his important and vital mission and legacy; and that is needed now, more than ever, for so many of the reasons that my colleagues here have highlighted. I thank the gentleman so much for the privilege of addressing and cosponsoring this legislation. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to this bill and to today's debate, especially Mr. Smith, Congresswoman Barbara Comstock and Mr. Engel. The right to believe and practice one's religion according to the dictates of conscience is often called the first freedom. It is one of the founding ideas of our Nation, but we do not believe that it is only an American value. Rather, this is what we believe here. We believe it flows from the inherent dignity of every human person, and it deserves protection everywhere. In today's world, those who are most violently opposed to religious freedom also pose the biggest threat to our Nation. They also pose the biggest threat to civilization worldwide. Thus, the promotion of religious liberty is not some isolated human rights concern. No. It is a key component of our national security. And this bill, now authored by Mr. Smith, H.R. 1150, contains important updates to the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 that will enhance the effectiveness of the United States' efforts to promote that liberty around the world, so it deserves our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1150, amending the Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act. I support this measure because the right to freedom of religion has been a cornerstone of the American conscience. Many of our country's first leaders fled religious persecution abroad and went on to establish laws protecting religious freedom. This core belief of our great nation does not stop at our national borders; we offer refuge to those suffering from religious persecution throughout the world. A testament to this commitment was the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 which was a landmark piece of legislation seeking to make religious freedom a higher priority in U.S. Foreign policy. The Act was approved by Congress unanimously in 1998 and signed into law by President Clinton. The Act condemns violations of religious freedom and promotes and assists other governments in the promotion of the fundamental right to freedom of religion. While strides have been made in establishing worldwide practice of freedom of religion, it is currently under attack. Let me also note that people are being prosecuted under blasphemy laws for freedom of expression, which is why I introduced the bipartisan measure H. Res. 290, calling for the global repeal of blasphemy laws. I support H.R. 1150 because we must continue to work to preserve religious freedoms as well as making sure that religion is not a pretext for prosecution or persecution in the world. Indeed, one of the key amendments to IRFA would be to relocate the Office of International Religious Freedom within the Office of the Secretary of State. This action would allow for greater coordination of strategic focus and the minimization of duplicated efforts, streamline mandates, and centralize efforts to engage religious communities and promote human rights more generally in regards to religious freedom. Currently, the office is headed by the Ambassador at-Large for International Religious Freedom which monitors religious persecution and discrimination worldwide to develop policy recommendations, programs, and awareness. Besides being placed in the Secretary of State's office, the Ambassador at large would be able to make every effort to collaborate and coordinate across all U.S. agencies and departments to formulate strategic religious freedom policies, programs, and activities. These two changes will provide a greater ability for us to advance religious freedom throughout the world. H.R. 1150 will also allow us to assist emerging democracies to implement freedom of religion while also helping older partners maintain their freedom of religion practices and conscience. H.R. 1150 calls to ensure that our diplomats and foreign policy experts are well versed in the importance of religious freedom and how to address atrocities related to religion. H.R. 1150 also addresses how to improve our ability to promote freedom of religion by enhancing the capabilities and knowledge of our diplomats. Our Foreign Service Officers (FSO) are on the front lines everyday carrying out American foreign policy while also shaping it, which makes sure that they are adequately trained on religious freedom. H.R. 1150 directs the Secretary to develop mandatory religious freedom training for all Foreign Service Officers. This major change will enhance FSO capabilities to identify severe persecutors to help assemble the Ambassador's Annual Report on International Religious Freedom. In addition to the Annual Report, H.R. 1150 calls for an updated lists of persons that are currently being persecuted and forced to renounce their faith. This is essential in bringing awareness to countries that need to be monitored or that have non-state actors that have high levels of detainment, disappearance, torture, or murder based on someone's religion. Another key aspect of H.R. 1150 is to enhance engagement and coordination with the executive branch on issues pertaining to international religious freedom policies and global religion engagement strategies. This would be achieved through amendment of The National Security Act of 1947, calling for the appointment of a Special Adviser for Global Religious Engagement and establishing the Interagency Policy Committee on Religious Freedom and Engagement. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support adequate funding in order to enable rapid and decisive efforts of supporting democracy and preservation of human rights. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Smith of Nebraska). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1150, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2399-H2406] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FRANK R.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 3 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6402) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (13)-- (A) in subparagraph (A)-- (i) by redesignating clauses (iv) and (v) as clauses (v) and (vi), respectively; and (ii) by inserting after clause (iii) the following: ``(iv) not professing a particular religion, or any religion;''; and (B) in subparagraph (B)-- (i) by inserting ``conscience, non-theistic views, or'' before ``religious belief or practice''; and (ii) by inserting after ``forced religious conversion'' the following: ``, forcibly compelling non-believers or non- theists to recant their beliefs or to convert''; and (2) by adding at the end, the following new paragraphs: ``(14) Special watch list.--The term `Special Watch List' means the Special Watch List as contained in the Executive Summary to the Annual Report and described in section 102(b)(1)(F)(iii). ``(15) Non-state actor.--The term `non-state actor' means a nonsovereign entity that exercises significant political power and is able to exert influence at a national or international level but does not belong to or ally itself to any particular country and often employs illegal violence in pursuit of its objectives. ``(16) Institution of higher education.--The term `institution of higher education' has the meaning given that term in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001)''. TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF STATE ACTIVITIES SEC. 101. OFFICE ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM; AMBASSADOR AT LARGE FOR INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. (a) In General.--Section 101 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6411) is amended-- (1) in subsection (b), by adding at the end before the period the following: ``, and shall report directly to the Secretary of State''; (2) in subsection (c)-- [[Page H2400]] (A) in paragraph (1)-- (i) by striking ``responsibility'' and inserting ``responsibilities''; (ii) by striking ``shall be to advance'' and inserting the following: ``shall be to-- ``(A) advance''; (iii) in subparagraph (A) (as so added), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (iv) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(B) integrate United States international religious freedom policies and strategies into the foreign policy efforts of the United States.''; (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``the principal adviser to'' before ``the Secretary of State''; (C) in paragraph (3)-- (i) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end; (ii) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (iii) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(C) contacts with nongovernmental organizations that have an impact on the state of religious freedom in their respective societies or regions, or internationally.''; (D) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and (E) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new paragraph: ``(4) Coordination responsibilities.--In order to promote religious freedom as an interest of United States foreign policy, the Ambassador at Large-- ``(A) shall coordinate international religious freedom policies across all programs, projects, and activities of the United States; and ``(B) should participate in any interagency processes on issues in which the promotion of international religious freedom policy can advance United States national security interests, including in democracy promotion, stability, security, and development globally.''; and (3) in subsection (d), by striking ``staff for the Office'' and all that follows through the period at the end and inserting ``individuals to fill at least 25 full-time equivalent staff positions, and any other temporary staff positions as needed to compile, edit, and manage the Annual Report under the direct supervision of the Ambassador at Large, and for the conduct of investigations by the Office and for necessary travel to carry out the provisions of this Act. The Secretary of State should also provide to the Ambassador at Large funds that are sufficient to carry out the duties described in this section, including as necessary representation funds, in amounts comparable to those provided to other Ambassadors at Large in the Department of State.''. (b) Sense of Congress.--Because international religious freedom is a vital foreign policy interest and one that needs coordination across many regional bureaus and among Special Envoys and Special Representatives with overlapping mandates, the Secretary of State should consider elevating the office of International Religious Freedom and the position of the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom to the Office of the Secretary, similar to other Ambassador-at- Large positions that now report directly to the Secretary. Providing the Office of International Religious Freedom with additional resources and status will demonstrate both the strategic importance of international religious freedom policy within the State Department bureaucracy and show persecuted religious groups globally that the U.S. gives priority to the protection and promotion of international religious freedom as mandated by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. SEC. 102. ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. (a) In General.--Section 102(b)(1) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412(b)(1)) is amended-- (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking ``September 1'' and inserting ``May 1''; (2) in subparagraph (A)-- (A) by redesignating clause (iv) as clause (vii); and (B) by inserting after clause (iii) the following new clauses: ``(iv) particularly severe violations of religious freedom in that country in the case of a foreign country with respect to which a government does not exist or the government does not control its territory; ``(v) an identification of prisoners in that country pursuant to section 108; ``(vi) any action taken by the government of that country to censor religious content, communications, or worship activities online, including descriptions of the targeted religious group, the content, communication, or activities censored, and the means used.''; (3) in subparagraph (B), in the matter preceding clause (i)-- (A) by inserting ``persecution of lawyers, politicians, or other human rights advocates seeking to defend the rights of members of religious groups or highlight religious freedom violations, prohibitions on ritual animal slaughter or male infant circumcision,'' after ``entire religions,''; and (B) by inserting ``policies that ban or restrict the public manifestation of religious belief and the peaceful involvement of religious groups or their members in the political life of each such foreign country,'' after ``such groups,''; (4) in subparagraph (C)-- (A) by striking ``A description'' and inserting ``A comprehensive description''; (B) by striking ``policies in support'' and inserting ``diplomatic and political coordination efforts, and other policies in support''; and (C) by adding at the end before the period the following: ``, and a comprehensive and country-specific analysis of the impact of actions by the United States on the status of religious freedom in each such country''; and (5) in subparagraph (F)-- (A) in clause (i)-- (i) by striking ``section 402(b)(1)'' and inserting ``section 402(b)(1)(B)(i)''; and (ii) by adding at the end the following: ``Any country in which a non-state actor designated as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom under section 301 of the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act is located shall be included in this section of the report.'' (B) by adding at the end the following new clause: ``(iii) Special watch list.--A list, to be known as the `Special Watch List', which shall identify each country that engages in or tolerates severe violations of religious freedom during the previous year but which the President determines does not meet, at the time of the publication of the Annual Report, all of the criteria described in section 3(11) for designation under section 402(b)(1).''. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the original intent of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.) was to require annual reports from both the Department of State and the Commission on International Religious Freedom to be delivered each year, during the same calendar year, and with at least 5 months separating these reports, in order to provide updated information for policy-makers, Members of Congress, and nongovernmental organizations; and (2) given that the annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices no longer contain updated information on religious freedom conditions globally, it is important that the Department of State and the Commission work together to fulfill the original intent of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. SEC. 103. TRAINING FOR FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS; REPORT. (a) Amendment to Foreign Service Act of 1980.--Section 708 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4028) is amended-- (1) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections (d) and (e), respectively; (2) in subsection (d), as redesignated, by striking ``The Secretary of State'' and inserting ``Refugees.--The Secretary of State''; (3) in subsection (e), as redesignated, by striking ``The Secretary of State'' and inserting ``Child Soldiers.--The Secretary of State''; (4) by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following: ``(a) Development of Curriculum.-- ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of State shall develop a curriculum for training United States Foreign Service officers in the scope and strategic value of international religious freedom, how violations of international religious freedom harm fundamental United States interests, how the advancement of international religious freedom can advance such interests, how United States international religious freedom policy should be carried out in practice by United States diplomats and other Foreign Service officers, and the relevance and relationship of international religious freedom to United States defense, diplomacy, development, and public affairs efforts. The Secretary of State shall ensure the availability of sufficient resources to develop and implement such curriculum. ``(2) Role of other officials.--The Secretary of State shall carry out paragraph (1)-- ``(A) with the assistance of the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom appointed under section 101(b) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998; ``(B) in coordination with the Director of the George P.

Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, the Director of the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center shall begin mandatory training on religious freedom for all Foreign Service officers, including all entry level officers, all officers prior to departure for posting outside the United States, and all outgoing deputy chiefs of mission and ambassadors. Such training shall, at minimum, be a separate, independent, and required segment of each of the following: ``(1) The A-100 course attended by all Foreign Service officers. ``(2) The courses required of every Foreign Service officer prior to a posting outside the United States, with segments tailored to the particular religious demography, religious freedom conditions, and United States strategies for advancing religious freedom, in each receiving country.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today, 18 years after enactment of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, the right to believe and practice one's faith remains under threat around the world. The threats come not just from authoritarian regimes obsessed with control, such as North Korea, Iran, or Vietnam, which were the focus of that law, but also from lethal terrorist groups. Two months ago this Chamber made history by declaring that the so- called Islamic State, or ISIS, is committing genocide against religious and ethnic minorities. It has committed mass murder, beheadings, rape, torture, slavery, and the kidnapping of children, among many other atrocities. ISIS dynamites churches and flattens ancient monasteries, hoping to erase the very existence of religious groups that disagree with their brutal world view. Boko Haram in Nigeria and al Shabaab in East Africa are also responsible for their own deadly persecutions, both also linked to ISIS in their support for that terrorist movement. These groups have turned religious intolerance into a murderous force of global instability. The right to believe and practice according to the dictates of conscience is a direct challenge to their ideologies. Thus, religious freedom is not just a human rights issue; frankly, today, it is a global security issue. However, current law related to religious freedom, which focuses solely on governments of sovereign states, does not address this reality. Based on years of oversight and multiple hearings, H.R. 1150, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, updates the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to improve the coordination and effectiveness of U.S. efforts to promote religious liberty around the world and also expressly addresses the role of these non-state actors like ISIS. Introduced by Subcommittee Chairman Smith and Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, the bill was amended and agreed to by the Foreign Affairs Committee and has more than 115 bipartisan cosponsors. It is fitting that this bill is named in honor of our former colleague from Virginia, Frank Wolf, a tireless advocate for human rights and the author of the original International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which we are amending. By enhancing coordination, confronting non-state actors, and improving reporting and training, H.R. 1150 is a helpful refinement of our statutory commitment to combat religious persecution around the globe. It deserves our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC, May 13, 2016. Hon. Ed Royce, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing concerning H.R. 1150, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2016.

Royce, Chairman. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Let me again thank Chairman Ed Royce for bringing this bill forward. I also want to thank my friend, Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey, for his leadership and for authorizing this bill. Mr. Speaker, freedom of religion has been a bedrock principle of open and democratic societies for centuries. Some of the first immigrants to settle on American shores sailed here because they were fleeing religious persecution at home. This liberty is enshrined in our own founding documents, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in the charters of democracies all over the world. The freedom to worship as a person chooses or not to worship at all should be settled business and nobody's business but the person themselves. Yet, around the world religious communities endure discrimination, persecution, and violence. It is amazing to me that, when we look at the history of strife and war that has swirled around religious persecution, governments continue to deny this freedom to their own people. This assault on religious liberty holds societies back and undercuts progress. It obviously has no place in the 21st century. So for the United States and other countries that cherish freedom, it is not enough just to guarantee religious liberty to our own people. We need to speak out and act when we see this right under attack around the world. For that matter, we have a responsibility to speak out when we see any liberty under attack, whether freedom of the press, the right to organize, or the equality of LGBT persons. Mr. Smith's legislation would help ensure that promoting and supporting religious liberty are a component of American foreign policy. It would help ensure that our diplomats around the world understand the importance of this issue and are working to advance this freedom on the front lines. It is worth noting that we should also continue to fully fund the State Department's Human Rights and Democracy Fund, which helps address a range of human rights abuses around the world, including threats to our religious freedom. Together with this legislation, it sends a clear message to the world that protecting human rights is a priority for the United States. So I support this measure. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I again want to congratulate my friend Mr. Smith, who is so strong on issues like this and so forceful in pushing forward all the way until we finally got this on the floor of the House. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations, and the author of the bill. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Chairman Royce, for his leadership on this bill, the markup, and for the very timely recommendations he and staff made to improve it. I would like to thank Eliot Engel again for working hand in glove in a good, bipartisan effort to protect international religious freedom. As my good friend, Chairman Royce, noted a moment ago, 18 years ago Congress had the foresight to pass the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. That landmark bill, authored by Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia, made advancing the right to religious freedom a significant and profoundly serious U.S. foreign policy priority. Passage of the International Religious Freedom Act was not easy. There were determined opponents in Congress and in the Clinton administration. I know. I chaired the congressional hearings and the subcommittee markup. It was no cakewalk. But our opposition was overcome by the courage, tenacity, and vision of Frank Wolf, bolstered by a diverse, bipartisan, and ecumenical coalition of Members of Congress, ethnic minority and religions groups, and human rights organizations. That coalition has reassembled to support this bill today, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act. I want to especially thank Anna Eshoo, who is the principal Democratic sponsor of this legislation, for her leadership and for working particularly in the Middle East to combat the savagery that is being imposed upon people of minority faiths, including Christians. {time} 1700 I thank her for her leadership and, again, for being the principal Democrat on this bill. Let me just note that naming this bill after Frank Wolf, who I consider to be, and many of us consider to be the William Wilberforce of modern times, is an attempt to recognize his extraordinary life's work promoting human rights, 34 years as a Member of Congress, including, and especially, religious freedom. He now serves as the Wilson Chair at Baylor, again, continuing his lifesaving work for religious believers all over the world. He just returned from Nigeria and testified at our hearing last week. He was in the embattled states in northern Nigeria, where Boko Haram runs free, massacring people. He was there on a fact-finding mission to promote religious freedom. Mr. Speaker, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act that is before us is a series of upgrades to meet the challenges of the 21st century. We know that the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis of international religious freedom; a crisis that continues to create millions--no, tens of millions of victims; a crisis that undermines liberty, prosperity, and peace; a crisis that poses a direct challenge to the U.S. interests in the Middle East, Russia, China, Sub-Saharan Africa, and elsewhere in the world. The Pew Research Center notes that over 75 percent of the world's population today lives in countries where severe religious freedom abuses occur annually. According to Pew, instances of anti-Semitism are at a 7-year high. It is getting worse everywhere, particularly in the Middle East, but also in Europe and in the United States. Mr. Speaker, ancient Christian communities in Iraq and Syria are on the verge of extinction, and other religious minorities in the Middle East face a [[Page H2405]] constant assault from the Islamic State. Several weeks ago, this Congress passed a resolution, sponsored by Jeff Fortenberry, that was followed by a declaration by Secretary of State John Kerry, that said that ISIS has committed, and continues to commit genocide, mass atrocities and war crimes against Christians, Yazidis, and other minority faiths. We are on record. We know it is happening. We are speaking out. In a couple of weeks, I am chairing a hearing on what is next; what should we be doing next to combat this terrible, terrible crisis. In Nigeria, the Islamist terror group, Boko Haram, is believed to have killed over 6,600 people last year alone, mostly Christian, but there are Muslims as well who are being targeted. According to the testimony we received last week, since 2009, the number is about 15,000 year to date since 2009. Mr. Speaker, at one of those hearings a few years ago, I had a man named Habila. Habila, I met him at an IDP camp in Jos, Nigeria, where a lot of churches have been firebombed. He told me this story. He was credible, and it checked out. And he came to Congress and testified. Boko Haram put an AK-47--a terrorist--to his jaw and said: Renounce Christ or I will kill you. You must become a Muslim on the spot. Habila said: I am ready to meet my Lord. And this terrorist pulled the trigger and blew most of his face away. What courage, what faith for a man. And when he told the story, you could have heard a pin drop. Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom just released its 2016 annual report. And let me note, parenthetically, USCIRF, or that Commission, was also created by Chairman Wolf as part of IRFA, the original bill. They have found that the abuses committed by governments and non- state actors has ``deteriorated.'' ``The incarceration of prisoners of conscience''--they point out--``remains astonishingly widespread . . .'' They point out that ``Over the past year, the Chinese government''-- as just one of many examples--``has stepped up its persecution of religious groups''--across the board: Tibetans, Uighurs, Muslim Uighurs, Christians, and, of course, the Falun Gong. I spoke in mid-February at NYU, I gave a keynote there in Shanghai, and talked about how Xi Jinping, the President of China, is in a race to the bottom with North Korea to make religion absolutely subservient to the Communist Party. He calls it the sinification of religion; and what was already a bad situation has now become demonstrably worse. The Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act will upgrade the tools so that this administration, and subsequent ones, can do an even better job to try to mitigate and, hopefully, end religious persecution. It does this by, one, requiring that international religious freedom policies be integrated into national security, immigration, rule of law, and other relevant U.S. foreign policies. It creates a Designated Persons List of individuals sanctioned for participating in or directing religious freedom abuses. It expands diplomatic training on international religious freedoms for all State Department diplomats; creates a tier system for IRFA, for the reports, not just countries of particular concern, of which there are currently 10, but also those that are on a watch list, those that are bad and, perhaps, getting worse. It gives the President authority to designate non-state actors in addition to countries; and it also requires the Ambassador at Large to report directly to the Secretary of State. It also is increasingly clear that religious freedom diplomacy is really needed to advance U.S. interests around the world. This will do it. The legislation is backed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the International Religious Freedom Roundtable, a diverse and ecumenical group of individuals from the faith community. Finally, just let me thank Scott Flipse, who worked for Frank Wolf previously, then he worked for the International Religious Freedom Office at the State Department, and now is working at the China Commission; our General Counsel, Piero Tozzi; Janice Kaguyutan, I thank her for her work on this; and Sajit Gandhi. This is a true, bipartisan piece of legislation and, hopefully, the Senate will favorably receive it. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Again, Mr. Speaker, in closing, we focus on human rights as part of our foreign policy because it is the right thing to do. The United States is founded on the idea that an individual should be able to live according to his or her own beliefs. That is a value we want to see thriving around the world. Advancing human rights is also the smart thing to do. Countries with a strong respect for human rights are countries that prosper and play a constructive role on the global stage. I want to again say to my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), when he comes for advancing human rights, he takes a second seat to nobody. He is indefatigable when it comes to these things. In all the years I have known him, he has always been fair and honest. I really sincerely commend him, and know how heartfelt it is and how much we appreciate his hard work. When we see governments stifling religious freedom, or any freedom, we have a responsibility to speak out and make it clear that the United States remains a champion for these basic liberties. This bill helps us to live up to that responsibility, and I am proud to support it. I thank Chairman Royce and Mr. Smith. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), our esteemed colleague, who ably represents the district formerly served by Frank Wolf, who is honored in the title of this bill. Representative Barbara Comstock is a coauthor of this bill with Mr. Smith, and I thank them both. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, ask human rights and religious freedom advocates to name their most steadfast friend who has served on Capitol Hill over the years, and Representative Frank Wolf, my predecessor, is always on the short list, as are my colleagues here today. So I am honored today to stand in support of a bill I proudly cosponsored, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, named after the distinguished gentleman who served in this seat for the 10th District of Virginia, and as the co-chair of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, and a man whose deep faith and commitment to human rights and religion freedom were a large part of why he was known for years here and around the country, and even around the world, as the conscience of the Congress. He wrote a book, a powerful book, titled a ``Prisoner of Conscience,'' about his many trips over the years and how he fought for religious freedom; and I hope he doesn't mind if I recommend that book to our listeners here. We continue to be blessed with Congressman Wolf's passionate leadership as he leads the 21st Century Wilberforce Initiative to create a world where religious freedom is recognized by nations across the globe as a fundamental human right. Since leaving Congress, Mr. Wolf has continued to travel to the front lines to see, firsthand, the plight of ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria, including Christians, Yazidis, Kurds, and other minority religious groups. As previously mentioned, he has just returned from Nigeria. He continues to shine a light every day on the dark places where men and women and children, even, of faith are victimized, tortured and, tragically, even killed for their faith. He will not let the world look away, and we thank him for his continued work and his strong and much- needed voice. Now this legislation amends his own legislation to continue that mission that Mr. Wolf so valiantly fought for for 3 decades here in Congress. It will improve the ability of the United States to advance religious freedom globally, with stronger and more flexible political responses to a disturbing and growing denial of basic religious freedoms around the world. [[Page H2406]] As has been said by many, Frank Wolf is the William Wilberforce of our day. He is, and has always been, a voice for the voiceless. He once said: ``Most would agree that conscience rights figure prominently in the narrative of America's founding. Historically, Americans and our corresponding institutions have recognized that conscience is not ultimately allegiant to the state, but to something, and for many people, Someone, higher.'' I appreciate the opportunity today to continue that legacy with the passing of this important legislation which will continue his important and vital mission and legacy; and that is needed now, more than ever, for so many of the reasons that my colleagues here have highlighted. I thank the gentleman so much for the privilege of addressing and cosponsoring this legislation. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to this bill and to today's debate, especially Mr. Smith, Congresswoman Barbara Comstock and Mr. Engel. The right to believe and practice one's religion according to the dictates of conscience is often called the first freedom. It is one of the founding ideas of our Nation, but we do not believe that it is only an American value. Rather, this is what we believe here. We believe it flows from the inherent dignity of every human person, and it deserves protection everywhere. In today's world, those who are most violently opposed to religious freedom also pose the biggest threat to our Nation. They also pose the biggest threat to civilization worldwide. Thus, the promotion of religious liberty is not some isolated human rights concern. No. It is a key component of our national security. And this bill, now authored by Mr. Smith, H.R. 1150, contains important updates to the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 that will enhance the effectiveness of the United States' efforts to promote that liberty around the world, so it deserves our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1150, amending the Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act. I support this measure because the right to freedom of religion has been a cornerstone of the American conscience. Many of our country's first leaders fled religious persecution abroad and went on to establish laws protecting religious freedom. This core belief of our great nation does not stop at our national borders; we offer refuge to those suffering from religious persecution throughout the world. A testament to this commitment was the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 which was a landmark piece of legislation seeking to make religious freedom a higher priority in U.S. Foreign policy. The Act was approved by Congress unanimously in 1998 and signed into law by President Clinton. The Act condemns violations of religious freedom and promotes and assists other governments in the promotion of the fundamental right to freedom of religion. While strides have been made in establishing worldwide practice of freedom of religion, it is currently under attack. Let me also note that people are being prosecuted under blasphemy laws for freedom of expression, which is why I introduced the bipartisan measure H. Res. 290, calling for the global repeal of blasphemy laws. I support H.R. 1150 because we must continue to work to preserve religious freedoms as well as making sure that religion is not a pretext for prosecution or persecution in the world. Indeed, one of the key amendments to IRFA would be to relocate the Office of International Religious Freedom within the Office of the Secretary of State. This action would allow for greater coordination of strategic focus and the minimization of duplicated efforts, streamline mandates, and centralize efforts to engage religious communities and promote human rights more generally in regards to religious freedom. Currently, the office is headed by the Ambassador at-Large for International Religious Freedom which monitors religious persecution and discrimination worldwide to develop policy recommendations, programs, and awareness. Besides being placed in the Secretary of State's office, the Ambassador at large would be able to make every effort to collaborate and coordinate across all U.S. agencies and departments to formulate strategic religious freedom policies, programs, and activities. These two changes will provide a greater ability for us to advance religious freedom throughout the world. H.R. 1150 will also allow us to assist emerging democracies to implement freedom of religion while also helping older partners maintain their freedom of religion practices and conscience. H.R. 1150 calls to ensure that our diplomats and foreign policy experts are well versed in the importance of religious freedom and how to address atrocities related to religion. H.R. 1150 also addresses how to improve our ability to promote freedom of religion by enhancing the capabilities and knowledge of our diplomats. Our Foreign Service Officers (FSO) are on the front lines everyday carrying out American foreign policy while also shaping it, which makes sure that they are adequately trained on religious freedom. H.R. 1150 directs the Secretary to develop mandatory religious freedom training for all Foreign Service Officers. This major change will enhance FSO capabilities to identify severe persecutors to help assemble the Ambassador's Annual Report on International Religious Freedom. In addition to the Annual Report, H.R. 1150 calls for an updated lists of persons that are currently being persecuted and forced to renounce their faith. This is essential in bringing awareness to countries that need to be monitored or that have non-state actors that have high levels of detainment, disappearance, torture, or murder based on someone's religion. Another key aspect of H.R. 1150 is to enhance engagement and coordination with the executive branch on issues pertaining to international religious freedom policies and global religion engagement strategies. This would be achieved through amendment of The National Security Act of 1947, calling for the appointment of a Special Adviser for Global Religious Engagement and establishing the Interagency Policy Committee on Religious Freedom and Engagement. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support adequate funding in order to enable rapid and decisive efforts of supporting democracy and preservation of human rights. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Smith of Nebraska). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1150, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2399-H2406] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FRANK R.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 3 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6402) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (13)-- (A) in subparagraph (A)-- (i) by redesignating clauses (iv) and (v) as clauses (v) and (vi), respectively; and (ii) by inserting after clause (iii) the following: ``(iv) not professing a particular religion, or any religion;''; and (B) in subparagraph (B)-- (i) by inserting ``conscience, non-theistic views, or'' before ``religious belief or practice''; and (ii) by inserting after ``forced religious conversion'' the following: ``, forcibly compelling non-believers or non- theists to recant their beliefs or to convert''; and (2) by adding at the end, the following new paragraphs: ``(14) Special watch list.--The term `Special Watch List' means the Special Watch List as contained in the Executive Summary to the Annual Report and described in section 102(b)(1)(F)(iii). ``(15) Non-state actor.--The term `non-state actor' means a nonsovereign entity that exercises significant political power and is able to exert influence at a national or international level but does not belong to or ally itself to any particular country and often employs illegal violence in pursuit of its objectives. ``(16) Institution of higher education.--The term `institution of higher education' has the meaning given that term in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001)''. TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF STATE ACTIVITIES SEC. 101. OFFICE ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM; AMBASSADOR AT LARGE FOR INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. (a) In General.--Section 101 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6411) is amended-- (1) in subsection (b), by adding at the end before the period the following: ``, and shall report directly to the Secretary of State''; (2) in subsection (c)-- [[Page H2400]] (A) in paragraph (1)-- (i) by striking ``responsibility'' and inserting ``responsibilities''; (ii) by striking ``shall be to advance'' and inserting the following: ``shall be to-- ``(A) advance''; (iii) in subparagraph (A) (as so added), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (iv) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(B) integrate United States international religious freedom policies and strategies into the foreign policy efforts of the United States.''; (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``the principal adviser to'' before ``the Secretary of State''; (C) in paragraph (3)-- (i) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end; (ii) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (iii) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(C) contacts with nongovernmental organizations that have an impact on the state of religious freedom in their respective societies or regions, or internationally.''; (D) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and (E) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new paragraph: ``(4) Coordination responsibilities.--In order to promote religious freedom as an interest of United States foreign policy, the Ambassador at Large-- ``(A) shall coordinate international religious freedom policies across all programs, projects, and activities of the United States; and ``(B) should participate in any interagency processes on issues in which the promotion of international religious freedom policy can advance United States national security interests, including in democracy promotion, stability, security, and development globally.''; and (3) in subsection (d), by striking ``staff for the Office'' and all that follows through the period at the end and inserting ``individuals to fill at least 25 full-time equivalent staff positions, and any other temporary staff positions as needed to compile, edit, and manage the Annual Report under the direct supervision of the Ambassador at Large, and for the conduct of investigations by the Office and for necessary travel to carry out the provisions of this Act. The Secretary of State should also provide to the Ambassador at Large funds that are sufficient to carry out the duties described in this section, including as necessary representation funds, in amounts comparable to those provided to other Ambassadors at Large in the Department of State.''. (b) Sense of Congress.--Because international religious freedom is a vital foreign policy interest and one that needs coordination across many regional bureaus and among Special Envoys and Special Representatives with overlapping mandates, the Secretary of State should consider elevating the office of International Religious Freedom and the position of the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom to the Office of the Secretary, similar to other Ambassador-at- Large positions that now report directly to the Secretary. Providing the Office of International Religious Freedom with additional resources and status will demonstrate both the strategic importance of international religious freedom policy within the State Department bureaucracy and show persecuted religious groups globally that the U.S. gives priority to the protection and promotion of international religious freedom as mandated by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. SEC. 102. ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. (a) In General.--Section 102(b)(1) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412(b)(1)) is amended-- (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking ``September 1'' and inserting ``May 1''; (2) in subparagraph (A)-- (A) by redesignating clause (iv) as clause (vii); and (B) by inserting after clause (iii) the following new clauses: ``(iv) particularly severe violations of religious freedom in that country in the case of a foreign country with respect to which a government does not exist or the government does not control its territory; ``(v) an identification of prisoners in that country pursuant to section 108; ``(vi) any action taken by the government of that country to censor religious content, communications, or worship activities online, including descriptions of the targeted religious group, the content, communication, or activities censored, and the means used.''; (3) in subparagraph (B), in the matter preceding clause (i)-- (A) by inserting ``persecution of lawyers, politicians, or other human rights advocates seeking to defend the rights of members of religious groups or highlight religious freedom violations, prohibitions on ritual animal slaughter or male infant circumcision,'' after ``entire religions,''; and (B) by inserting ``policies that ban or restrict the public manifestation of religious belief and the peaceful involvement of religious groups or their members in the political life of each such foreign country,'' after ``such groups,''; (4) in subparagraph (C)-- (A) by striking ``A description'' and inserting ``A comprehensive description''; (B) by striking ``policies in support'' and inserting ``diplomatic and political coordination efforts, and other policies in support''; and (C) by adding at the end before the period the following: ``, and a comprehensive and country-specific analysis of the impact of actions by the United States on the status of religious freedom in each such country''; and (5) in subparagraph (F)-- (A) in clause (i)-- (i) by striking ``section 402(b)(1)'' and inserting ``section 402(b)(1)(B)(i)''; and (ii) by adding at the end the following: ``Any country in which a non-state actor designated as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom under section 301 of the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act is located shall be included in this section of the report.'' (B) by adding at the end the following new clause: ``(iii) Special watch list.--A list, to be known as the `Special Watch List', which shall identify each country that engages in or tolerates severe violations of religious freedom during the previous year but which the President determines does not meet, at the time of the publication of the Annual Report, all of the criteria described in section 3(11) for designation under section 402(b)(1).''. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the original intent of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.) was to require annual reports from both the Department of State and the Commission on International Religious Freedom to be delivered each year, during the same calendar year, and with at least 5 months separating these reports, in order to provide updated information for policy-makers, Members of Congress, and nongovernmental organizations; and (2) given that the annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices no longer contain updated information on religious freedom conditions globally, it is important that the Department of State and the Commission work together to fulfill the original intent of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. SEC. 103. TRAINING FOR FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS; REPORT. (a) Amendment to Foreign Service Act of 1980.--Section 708 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4028) is amended-- (1) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections (d) and (e), respectively; (2) in subsection (d), as redesignated, by striking ``The Secretary of State'' and inserting ``Refugees.--The Secretary of State''; (3) in subsection (e), as redesignated, by striking ``The Secretary of State'' and inserting ``Child Soldiers.--The Secretary of State''; (4) by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following: ``(a) Development of Curriculum.-- ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of State shall develop a curriculum for training United States Foreign Service officers in the scope and strategic value of international religious freedom, how violations of international religious freedom harm fundamental United States interests, how the advancement of international religious freedom can advance such interests, how United States international religious freedom policy should be carried out in practice by United States diplomats and other Foreign Service officers, and the relevance and relationship of international religious freedom to United States defense, diplomacy, development, and public affairs efforts.

Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, the Director of the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center shall begin mandatory training on religious freedom for all Foreign Service officers, including all entry level officers, all officers prior to departure for posting outside the United States, and all outgoing deputy chiefs of mission and ambassadors. Such training shall, at minimum, be a separate, independent, and required segment of each of the following: ``(1) The A-100 course attended by all Foreign Service officers. ``(2) The courses required of every Foreign Service officer prior to a posting outside the United States, with segments tailored to the particular religious demography, religious freedom conditions, and United States strategies for advancing religious freedom, in each receiving country.

SEC. 104. PRISONER LISTS AND ISSUE BRIEFS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM CONCERNS. Section 108 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6417) is amended-- (1) in subsection (b), by striking ``faith'' and inserting ``activities, religious freedom advocacy, or efforts to protect and advance the universally-recognized right to the freedom of religion,''; (2) in subsection (c), by striking ``, as appropriate, provide'' and insert ``make available''; and (3) by adding at the end the following new subsection: ``(d) Victims List Maintained by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.-- ``(1) In general.--The Commission shall make publicly available online and in official publications lists of persons it determines are imprisoned, detained, disappeared, placed under house arrest, tortured, or subject to forced renunciations of faith for their religious activity or religious freedom advocacy by the government of a foreign country that the Commission recommends for designation as a country of particular concern for religious freedom under section 402(b)(1) or by a non-state actor that the Commission recommends for designation as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom under section 301 of the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act and include as much publicly-available information as possible on the conditions and circumstances of such persons. ``(2) Discretion.--In compiling such lists, the Commission shall exercise all appropriate discretion, including consideration of the safety and security of, and benefit to, the persons who may be included on the lists and the families of such persons.''. TITLE II--NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SEC. 201. SPECIAL ADVISER FOR INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. Section 101 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3021) is amended by striking subsection (k) and inserting the following: ``(k) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that there should be within the staff of the National Security Council a Special Adviser to the President on International Religious Freedom, whose position should be comparable to that of a director within the Executive Office of the President, with the primary responsibility to serve as a resource for executive branch officials on international religious freedom, compiling and maintaining information on the facts and circumstances of violations of religious freedom (as defined in section 3 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998), and making relevant policy recommendations to advance United States international religious freedom policy. The Special Advisor should also assist the Ambassador-at-Large to coordinate international religious freedom policies and strategies throughout the executive branch and within any interagency policy committees where the Ambassador-at-Large participates.''. TITLE III--PRESIDENTIAL ACTIONS SEC. 301. NON-STATE ACTOR DESIGNATIONS. (a) In General.--The President shall, concurrent with the annual foreign country review required by section 402(b)(1) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1))-- (1) review and identify any non-state actors operating in any such reviewed country or surrounding region that have engaged in particularly severe violations of religious freedom; and (2) designate, in a manner consistent with such Act, each such non-state actor as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom. (b) Report.--Whenever the President designates a non-state actor under subsection (a) as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom, the President shall, as soon as practicable after the designation is made, submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report detailing the reasons for such designation. (c) Actions.--The President should take specific actions to address severe violations of religious freedom of non-state actors that are designated under subsection (a), including taking actions commensurate to those actions described in section 405 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6445). (d) Department of State Annual Report.--The Secretary of State should include information detailing the reasons the President designated a non-state actor as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom under subsection (a) in the Annual Report required in section 102(b)(1) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)). (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should work with Congress to create new political, financial, and diplomatic tools to address severe violations of religious freedom by non-state actors and to update the actions the President can take in section 405 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. (f) Determinations of Responsible Parties.--In order to appropriately target Presidential actions under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 in response, the President shall with respect to each non-state actor designated as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom under subsection (a), seek to determine the specific officials or members thereof that are responsible for the particularly severe violations of religious freedom engaged in or tolerated by that entity.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today, 18 years after enactment of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, the right to believe and practice one's faith remains under threat around the world. The threats come not just from authoritarian regimes obsessed with control, such as North Korea, Iran, or Vietnam, which were the focus of that law, but also from lethal terrorist groups. Two months ago this Chamber made history by declaring that the so- called Islamic State, or ISIS, is committing genocide against religious and ethnic minorities. It has committed mass murder, beheadings, rape, torture, slavery, and the kidnapping of children, among many other atrocities. ISIS dynamites churches and flattens ancient monasteries, hoping to erase the very existence of religious groups that disagree with their brutal world view. Boko Haram in Nigeria and al Shabaab in East Africa are also responsible for their own deadly persecutions, both also linked to ISIS in their support for that terrorist movement. These groups have turned religious intolerance into a murderous force of global instability. The right to believe and practice according to the dictates of conscience is a direct challenge to their ideologies. Thus, religious freedom is not just a human rights issue; frankly, today, it is a global security issue. However, current law related to religious freedom, which focuses solely on governments of sovereign states, does not address this reality. Based on years of oversight and multiple hearings, H.R. 1150, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, updates the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to improve the coordination and effectiveness of U.S. efforts to promote religious liberty around the world and also expressly addresses the role of these non-state actors like ISIS. Introduced by Subcommittee Chairman Smith and Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, the bill was amended and agreed to by the Foreign Affairs Committee and has more than 115 bipartisan cosponsors. It is fitting that this bill is named in honor of our former colleague from Virginia, Frank Wolf, a tireless advocate for human rights and the author of the original International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which we are amending. By enhancing coordination, confronting non-state actors, and improving reporting and training, H.R. 1150 is a helpful refinement of our statutory commitment to combat religious persecution around the globe. It deserves our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC, May 13, 2016. Hon. Ed Royce, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing concerning H.R. 1150, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2016.

Royce, Chairman. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Let me again thank Chairman Ed Royce for bringing this bill forward. I also want to thank my friend, Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey, for his leadership and for authorizing this bill. Mr. Speaker, freedom of religion has been a bedrock principle of open and democratic societies for centuries. Some of the first immigrants to settle on American shores sailed here because they were fleeing religious persecution at home. This liberty is enshrined in our own founding documents, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in the charters of democracies all over the world. The freedom to worship as a person chooses or not to worship at all should be settled business and nobody's business but the person themselves. Yet, around the world religious communities endure discrimination, persecution, and violence. It is amazing to me that, when we look at the history of strife and war that has swirled around religious persecution, governments continue to deny this freedom to their own people. This assault on religious liberty holds societies back and undercuts progress. It obviously has no place in the 21st century. So for the United States and other countries that cherish freedom, it is not enough just to guarantee religious liberty to our own people. We need to speak out and act when we see this right under attack around the world. For that matter, we have a responsibility to speak out when we see any liberty under attack, whether freedom of the press, the right to organize, or the equality of LGBT persons. Mr. Smith's legislation would help ensure that promoting and supporting religious liberty are a component of American foreign policy. It would help ensure that our diplomats around the world understand the importance of this issue and are working to advance this freedom on the front lines. It is worth noting that we should also continue to fully fund the State Department's Human Rights and Democracy Fund, which helps address a range of human rights abuses around the world, including threats to our religious freedom. Together with this legislation, it sends a clear message to the world that protecting human rights is a priority for the United States. So I support this measure. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I again want to congratulate my friend Mr. Smith, who is so strong on issues like this and so forceful in pushing forward all the way until we finally got this on the floor of the House. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations, and the author of the bill. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Chairman Royce, for his leadership on this bill, the markup, and for the very timely recommendations he and staff made to improve it. I would like to thank Eliot Engel again for working hand in glove in a good, bipartisan effort to protect international religious freedom. As my good friend, Chairman Royce, noted a moment ago, 18 years ago Congress had the foresight to pass the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. That landmark bill, authored by Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia, made advancing the right to religious freedom a significant and profoundly serious U.S. foreign policy priority. Passage of the International Religious Freedom Act was not easy. There were determined opponents in Congress and in the Clinton administration. I know. I chaired the congressional hearings and the subcommittee markup. It was no cakewalk. But our opposition was overcome by the courage, tenacity, and vision of Frank Wolf, bolstered by a diverse, bipartisan, and ecumenical coalition of Members of Congress, ethnic minority and religions groups, and human rights organizations. That coalition has reassembled to support this bill today, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act. I want to especially thank Anna Eshoo, who is the principal Democratic sponsor of this legislation, for her leadership and for working particularly in the Middle East to combat the savagery that is being imposed upon people of minority faiths, including Christians. {time} 1700 I thank her for her leadership and, again, for being the principal Democrat on this bill. Let me just note that naming this bill after Frank Wolf, who I consider to be, and many of us consider to be the William Wilberforce of modern times, is an attempt to recognize his extraordinary life's work promoting human rights, 34 years as a Member of Congress, including, and especially, religious freedom. He now serves as the Wilson Chair at Baylor, again, continuing his lifesaving work for religious believers all over the world. He just returned from Nigeria and testified at our hearing last week. He was in the embattled states in northern Nigeria, where Boko Haram runs free, massacring people. He was there on a fact-finding mission to promote religious freedom. Mr. Speaker, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act that is before us is a series of upgrades to meet the challenges of the 21st century. We know that the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis of international religious freedom; a crisis that continues to create millions--no, tens of millions of victims; a crisis that undermines liberty, prosperity, and peace; a crisis that poses a direct challenge to the U.S. interests in the Middle East, Russia, China, Sub-Saharan Africa, and elsewhere in the world. The Pew Research Center notes that over 75 percent of the world's population today lives in countries where severe religious freedom abuses occur annually. According to Pew, instances of anti-Semitism are at a 7-year high. It is getting worse everywhere, particularly in the Middle East, but also in Europe and in the United States. Mr. Speaker, ancient Christian communities in Iraq and Syria are on the verge of extinction, and other religious minorities in the Middle East face a [[Page H2405]] constant assault from the Islamic State. Several weeks ago, this Congress passed a resolution, sponsored by Jeff Fortenberry, that was followed by a declaration by Secretary of State John Kerry, that said that ISIS has committed, and continues to commit genocide, mass atrocities and war crimes against Christians, Yazidis, and other minority faiths. We are on record. We know it is happening. We are speaking out. In a couple of weeks, I am chairing a hearing on what is next; what should we be doing next to combat this terrible, terrible crisis. In Nigeria, the Islamist terror group, Boko Haram, is believed to have killed over 6,600 people last year alone, mostly Christian, but there are Muslims as well who are being targeted. According to the testimony we received last week, since 2009, the number is about 15,000 year to date since 2009. Mr. Speaker, at one of those hearings a few years ago, I had a man named Habila. Habila, I met him at an IDP camp in Jos, Nigeria, where a lot of churches have been firebombed. He told me this story. He was credible, and it checked out. And he came to Congress and testified. Boko Haram put an AK-47--a terrorist--to his jaw and said: Renounce Christ or I will kill you. You must become a Muslim on the spot. Habila said: I am ready to meet my Lord. And this terrorist pulled the trigger and blew most of his face away. What courage, what faith for a man. And when he told the story, you could have heard a pin drop. Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom just released its 2016 annual report. And let me note, parenthetically, USCIRF, or that Commission, was also created by Chairman Wolf as part of IRFA, the original bill. They have found that the abuses committed by governments and non- state actors has ``deteriorated.'' ``The incarceration of prisoners of conscience''--they point out--``remains astonishingly widespread . . .'' They point out that ``Over the past year, the Chinese government''-- as just one of many examples--``has stepped up its persecution of religious groups''--across the board: Tibetans, Uighurs, Muslim Uighurs, Christians, and, of course, the Falun Gong. I spoke in mid-February at NYU, I gave a keynote there in Shanghai, and talked about how Xi Jinping, the President of China, is in a race to the bottom with North Korea to make religion absolutely subservient to the Communist Party. He calls it the sinification of religion; and what was already a bad situation has now become demonstrably worse. The Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act will upgrade the tools so that this administration, and subsequent ones, can do an even better job to try to mitigate and, hopefully, end religious persecution. It does this by, one, requiring that international religious freedom policies be integrated into national security, immigration, rule of law, and other relevant U.S. foreign policies. It creates a Designated Persons List of individuals sanctioned for participating in or directing religious freedom abuses. It expands diplomatic training on international religious freedoms for all State Department diplomats; creates a tier system for IRFA, for the reports, not just countries of particular concern, of which there are currently 10, but also those that are on a watch list, those that are bad and, perhaps, getting worse. It gives the President authority to designate non-state actors in addition to countries; and it also requires the Ambassador at Large to report directly to the Secretary of State. It also is increasingly clear that religious freedom diplomacy is really needed to advance U.S. interests around the world. This will do it. The legislation is backed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the International Religious Freedom Roundtable, a diverse and ecumenical group of individuals from the faith community. Finally, just let me thank Scott Flipse, who worked for Frank Wolf previously, then he worked for the International Religious Freedom Office at the State Department, and now is working at the China Commission; our General Counsel, Piero Tozzi; Janice Kaguyutan, I thank her for her work on this; and Sajit Gandhi. This is a true, bipartisan piece of legislation and, hopefully, the Senate will favorably receive it. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Again, Mr. Speaker, in closing, we focus on human rights as part of our foreign policy because it is the right thing to do. The United States is founded on the idea that an individual should be able to live according to his or her own beliefs. That is a value we want to see thriving around the world. Advancing human rights is also the smart thing to do. Countries with a strong respect for human rights are countries that prosper and play a constructive role on the global stage. I want to again say to my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), when he comes for advancing human rights, he takes a second seat to nobody. He is indefatigable when it comes to these things. In all the years I have known him, he has always been fair and honest. I really sincerely commend him, and know how heartfelt it is and how much we appreciate his hard work. When we see governments stifling religious freedom, or any freedom, we have a responsibility to speak out and make it clear that the United States remains a champion for these basic liberties. This bill helps us to live up to that responsibility, and I am proud to support it. I thank Chairman Royce and Mr. Smith. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), our esteemed colleague, who ably represents the district formerly served by Frank Wolf, who is honored in the title of this bill. Representative Barbara Comstock is a coauthor of this bill with Mr. Smith, and I thank them both. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, ask human rights and religious freedom advocates to name their most steadfast friend who has served on Capitol Hill over the years, and Representative Frank Wolf, my predecessor, is always on the short list, as are my colleagues here today. So I am honored today to stand in support of a bill I proudly cosponsored, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, named after the distinguished gentleman who served in this seat for the 10th District of Virginia, and as the co-chair of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, and a man whose deep faith and commitment to human rights and religion freedom were a large part of why he was known for years here and around the country, and even around the world, as the conscience of the Congress. He wrote a book, a powerful book, titled a ``Prisoner of Conscience,'' about his many trips over the years and how he fought for religious freedom; and I hope he doesn't mind if I recommend that book to our listeners here. We continue to be blessed with Congressman Wolf's passionate leadership as he leads the 21st Century Wilberforce Initiative to create a world where religious freedom is recognized by nations across the globe as a fundamental human right. Since leaving Congress, Mr. Wolf has continued to travel to the front lines to see, firsthand, the plight of ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria, including Christians, Yazidis, Kurds, and other minority religious groups. As previously mentioned, he has just returned from Nigeria. He continues to shine a light every day on the dark places where men and women and children, even, of faith are victimized, tortured and, tragically, even killed for their faith. He will not let the world look away, and we thank him for his continued work and his strong and much- needed voice. Now this legislation amends his own legislation to continue that mission that Mr. Wolf so valiantly fought for for 3 decades here in Congress. It will improve the ability of the United States to advance religious freedom globally, with stronger and more flexible political responses to a disturbing and growing denial of basic religious freedoms around the world. [[Page H2406]] As has been said by many, Frank Wolf is the William Wilberforce of our day. He is, and has always been, a voice for the voiceless. He once said: ``Most would agree that conscience rights figure prominently in the narrative of America's founding. Historically, Americans and our corresponding institutions have recognized that conscience is not ultimately allegiant to the state, but to something, and for many people, Someone, higher.'' I appreciate the opportunity today to continue that legacy with the passing of this important legislation which will continue his important and vital mission and legacy; and that is needed now, more than ever, for so many of the reasons that my colleagues here have highlighted. I thank the gentleman so much for the privilege of addressing and cosponsoring this legislation. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to this bill and to today's debate, especially Mr. Smith, Congresswoman Barbara Comstock and Mr. Engel. The right to believe and practice one's religion according to the dictates of conscience is often called the first freedom. It is one of the founding ideas of our Nation, but we do not believe that it is only an American value. Rather, this is what we believe here. We believe it flows from the inherent dignity of every human person, and it deserves protection everywhere. In today's world, those who are most violently opposed to religious freedom also pose the biggest threat to our Nation. They also pose the biggest threat to civilization worldwide. Thus, the promotion of religious liberty is not some isolated human rights concern. No. It is a key component of our national security. And this bill, now authored by Mr. Smith, H.R. 1150, contains important updates to the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 that will enhance the effectiveness of the United States' efforts to promote that liberty around the world, so it deserves our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1150, amending the Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act. I support this measure because the right to freedom of religion has been a cornerstone of the American conscience. Many of our country's first leaders fled religious persecution abroad and went on to establish laws protecting religious freedom. This core belief of our great nation does not stop at our national borders; we offer refuge to those suffering from religious persecution throughout the world. A testament to this commitment was the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 which was a landmark piece of legislation seeking to make religious freedom a higher priority in U.S. Foreign policy. The Act was approved by Congress unanimously in 1998 and signed into law by President Clinton. The Act condemns violations of religious freedom and promotes and assists other governments in the promotion of the fundamental right to freedom of religion. While strides have been made in establishing worldwide practice of freedom of religion, it is currently under attack. Let me also note that people are being prosecuted under blasphemy laws for freedom of expression, which is why I introduced the bipartisan measure H. Res. 290, calling for the global repeal of blasphemy laws. I support H.R. 1150 because we must continue to work to preserve religious freedoms as well as making sure that religion is not a pretext for prosecution or persecution in the world. Indeed, one of the key amendments to IRFA would be to relocate the Office of International Religious Freedom within the Office of the Secretary of State. This action would allow for greater coordination of strategic focus and the minimization of duplicated efforts, streamline mandates, and centralize efforts to engage religious communities and promote human rights more generally in regards to religious freedom. Currently, the office is headed by the Ambassador at-Large for International Religious Freedom which monitors religious persecution and discrimination worldwide to develop policy recommendations, programs, and awareness. Besides being placed in the Secretary of State's office, the Ambassador at large would be able to make every effort to collaborate and coordinate across all U.S. agencies and departments to formulate strategic religious freedom policies, programs, and activities. These two changes will provide a greater ability for us to advance religious freedom throughout the world. H.R. 1150 will also allow us to assist emerging democracies to implement freedom of religion while also helping older partners maintain their freedom of religion practices and conscience. H.R. 1150 calls to ensure that our diplomats and foreign policy experts are well versed in the importance of religious freedom and how to address atrocities related to religion. H.R. 1150 also addresses how to improve our ability to promote freedom of religion by enhancing the capabilities and knowledge of our diplomats. Our Foreign Service Officers (FSO) are on the front lines everyday carrying out American foreign policy while also shaping it, which makes sure that they are adequately trained on religious freedom. H.R. 1150 directs the Secretary to develop mandatory religious freedom training for all Foreign Service Officers. This major change will enhance FSO capabilities to identify severe persecutors to help assemble the Ambassador's Annual Report on International Religious Freedom. In addition to the Annual Report, H.R. 1150 calls for an updated lists of persons that are currently being persecuted and forced to renounce their faith. This is essential in bringing awareness to countries that need to be monitored or that have non-state actors that have high levels of detainment, disappearance, torture, or murder based on someone's religion. Another key aspect of H.R. 1150 is to enhance engagement and coordination with the executive branch on issues pertaining to international religious freedom policies and global religion engagement strategies. This would be achieved through amendment of The National Security Act of 1947, calling for the appointment of a Special Adviser for Global Religious Engagement and establishing the Interagency Policy Committee on Religious Freedom and Engagement. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support adequate funding in order to enable rapid and decisive efforts of supporting democracy and preservation of human rights. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Smith of Nebraska). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1150, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_176.csv,68019,68019,68084,"[congressional record volume 162, number 77 (monday, may 16, 2016)] [house] [pages h2399-h2406] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] frank r. wolf international religious freedom act mr. royce. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 1150) to amend the international religious freedom act of 1998 to improve the ability of the united states to advance religious freedom globally through enhanced diplomacy, training, counterterrorism, and foreign assistance efforts, and through stronger and more flexible political responses to religious freedom violations and violent extremism worldwide, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 1150 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title and table of contents.

(a) in general.--section 101 of the international religious freedom act of 1998 (22 u.s.c. 6411) is amended-- (1) in subsection (b), by adding at the end before the period the following: ``, and shall report directly to the secretary of state''; (2) in subsection (c)-- [[page h2400]] (a) in paragraph (1)-- (i) by striking ``responsibility'' and inserting ``responsibilities''; (ii) by striking ``shall be to advance'' and inserting the following: ``shall be to-- ``(a) advance''; (iii) in subparagraph (a) (as so added), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (iv) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(b) integrate united states international religious freedom policies and strategies into the foreign policy efforts of the united states.''; (b) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``the principal adviser to'' before ``the secretary of state''; (c) in paragraph (3)-- (i) in subparagraph (a), by striking ``and'' at the end; (ii) in subparagraph (b), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (iii) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(c) contacts with nongovernmental organizations that have an impact on the state of religious freedom in their respective societies or regions, or internationally.''; (d) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and (e) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new paragraph: ``(4) coordination responsibilities.--in order to promote religious freedom as an interest of united states foreign policy, the ambassador at large-- ``(a) shall coordinate international religious freedom policies across all programs, projects, and activities of the united states; and ``(b) should participate in any interagency processes on issues in which the promotion of international religious freedom policy can advance united states national security interests, including in democracy promotion, stability, security, and development globally.''; and (3) in subsection (d), by striking ``staff for the office'' and all that follows through the period at the end and inserting ``individuals to fill at least 25 full-time equivalent staff positions, and any other temporary staff positions as needed to compile, edit, and manage the annual report under the direct supervision of the ambassador at large, and for the conduct of investigations by the office and for necessary travel to carry out the provisions of this act. the secretary of state should also provide to the ambassador at large funds that are sufficient to carry out the duties described in this section, including as necessary representation funds, in amounts comparable to those provided to other ambassadors at large in the department of state.''. (b) sense of congress.--because international religious freedom is a vital foreign policy interest and one that needs coordination across many regional bureaus and among special envoys and special representatives with overlapping mandates, the secretary of state should consider elevating the office of international religious freedom and the position of the ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom to the office of the secretary, similar to other ambassador-at- large positions that now report directly to the secretary. providing the office of international religious freedom with additional resources and status will demonstrate both the strategic importance of international religious freedom policy within the state department bureaucracy and show persecuted religious groups globally that the u.s. gives priority to the protection and promotion of international religious freedom as mandated by the international religious freedom act of 1998. sec. 102. annual report on international religious freedom.

(a) amendment to foreign service act of 1980.--section 708 of the foreign service act of 1980 (22 u.s.c. 4028) is amended-- (1) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections (d) and (e), respectively; (2) in subsection (d), as redesignated, by striking ``the secretary of state'' and inserting ``refugees.--the secretary of state''; (3) in subsection (e), as redesignated, by striking ``the secretary of state'' and inserting ``child soldiers.--the secretary of state''; (4) by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following: ``(a) development of curriculum.-- ``(1) in general.--the secretary of state shall develop a curriculum for training united states foreign service officers in the scope and strategic value of international religious freedom, how violations of international religious freedom harm fundamental united states interests, how the advancement of international religious freedom can advance such interests, how united states international religious freedom policy should be carried out in practice by united states diplomats and other foreign service officers, and the relevance and relationship of international religious freedom to united states defense, diplomacy, development, and public affairs efforts. the secretary of state shall ensure the availability of sufficient resources to develop and implement such curriculum. ``(2) role of other officials.--the secretary of state shall carry out paragraph (1)-- ``(a) with the assistance of the ambassador at large for international religious freedom appointed under section 101(b) of the international religious freedom act of 1998; ``(b) in coordination with the director of the george p. shultz national foreign affairs training center and other federal officials as appropriate; and ``(c) in consultation with the united states commission on international religious freedom established in section 201(a) of the international religious freedom act of 1998 and other relevant stakeholders. ``(b) training program.--not later than the date that is one year after the date of the enactment of the frank r. wolf international religious freedom act, the director of the george p. shultz national foreign affairs training center shall begin mandatory training on religious freedom for all foreign service officers, including all entry level officers, all officers prior to departure for posting outside the united states, and all outgoing deputy chiefs of mission and ambassadors. such training shall, at minimum, be a separate, independent, and required segment of each of the following: ``(1) the a-100 course attended by all foreign service officers. ``(2) the courses required of every foreign service officer prior to a posting outside the united states, with segments tailored to the particular religious demography, religious freedom conditions, and united states strategies for advancing religious freedom, in each receiving country.

speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, today, 18 years after enactment of the international religious freedom act of 1998, the right to believe and practice one's faith remains under threat around the world. the threats come not just from authoritarian regimes obsessed with control, such as north korea, iran, or vietnam, which were the focus of that law, but also from lethal terrorist groups. two months ago this chamber made history by declaring that the so- called islamic state, or isis, is committing genocide against religious and ethnic minorities. it has committed mass murder, beheadings, rape, torture, slavery, and the kidnapping of children, among many other atrocities. isis dynamites churches and flattens ancient monasteries, hoping to erase the very existence of religious groups that disagree with their brutal world view. boko haram in nigeria and al shabaab in east africa are also responsible for their own deadly persecutions, both also linked to isis in their support for that terrorist movement. these groups have turned religious intolerance into a murderous force of global instability. the right to believe and practice according to the dictates of conscience is a direct challenge to their ideologies. thus, religious freedom is not just a human rights issue; frankly, today, it is a global security issue. however, current law related to religious freedom, which focuses solely on governments of sovereign states, does not address this reality. based on years of oversight and multiple hearings, h.r. 1150, the frank r. wolf international religious freedom act, updates the international religious freedom act of 1998 to improve the coordination and effectiveness of u.s. efforts to promote religious liberty around the world and also expressly addresses the role of these non-state actors like isis. introduced by subcommittee chairman smith and congresswoman anna eshoo, the bill was amended and agreed to by the foreign affairs committee and has more than 115 bipartisan cosponsors. it is fitting that this bill is named in honor of our former colleague from virginia, frank wolf, a tireless advocate for human rights and the author of the original international religious freedom act of 1998, which we are amending. by enhancing coordination, confronting non-state actors, and improving reporting and training, h.r. 1150 is a helpful refinement of our statutory commitment to combat religious persecution around the globe. it deserves our unanimous support. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. house of representatives, committee on financial services, washington, dc, may 13, 2016. hon. ed royce,

royce, chairman. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this measure. let me again thank chairman ed royce for bringing this bill forward. i also want to thank my friend, congressman chris smith of new jersey, for his leadership and for authorizing this bill. mr. speaker, freedom of religion has been a bedrock principle of open and democratic societies for centuries. some of the first immigrants to settle on american shores sailed here because they were fleeing religious persecution at home. this liberty is enshrined in our own founding documents, in the universal declaration of human rights, and in the charters of democracies all over the world. the freedom to worship as a person chooses or not to worship at all should be settled business and nobody's business but the person themselves. yet, around the world religious communities endure discrimination, persecution, and violence. it is amazing to me that, when we look at the history of strife and war that has swirled around religious persecution, governments continue to deny this freedom to their own people. this assault on religious liberty holds societies back and undercuts progress. it obviously has no place in the 21st century. so for the united states and other countries that cherish freedom, it is not enough just to guarantee religious liberty to our own people. we need to speak out and act when we see this right under attack around the world. for that matter, we have a responsibility to speak out when we see any liberty under attack, whether freedom of the press, the right to organize, or the equality of lgbt persons. mr. smith's legislation would help ensure that promoting and supporting religious liberty are a component of american foreign policy. it would help ensure that our diplomats around the world understand the importance of this issue and are working to advance this freedom on the front lines. it is worth noting that we should also continue to fully fund the state department's human rights and democracy fund, which helps address a range of human rights abuses around the world, including threats to our religious freedom. together with this legislation, it sends a clear message to the world that protecting human rights is a priority for the united states. so i support this measure. i urge my colleagues to do the same. i again want to congratulate my friend mr. smith, who is so strong on issues like this and so forceful in pushing forward all the way until we finally got this on the floor of the house. i urge my colleagues to support this measure. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. smith), chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on africa, global health, global human rights, and international organizations, and the author of the bill. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i want to thank my good friend, chairman royce, for his leadership on this bill, the markup, and for the very timely recommendations he and staff made to improve it. i would like to thank eliot engel again for working hand in glove in a good, bipartisan effort to protect international religious freedom. as my good friend, chairman royce, noted a moment ago, 18 years ago congress had the foresight to pass the international religious freedom act of 1998. that landmark bill, authored by congressman frank wolf of virginia, made advancing the right to religious freedom a significant and profoundly serious u.s. foreign policy priority. passage of the international religious freedom act was not easy. there were determined opponents in congress and in the clinton administration. i know. i chaired the congressional hearings and the subcommittee markup. it was no cakewalk. but our opposition was overcome by the courage, tenacity, and vision of frank wolf, bolstered by a diverse, bipartisan, and ecumenical coalition of members of congress, ethnic minority and religions groups, and human rights organizations. that coalition has reassembled to support this bill today, the frank r. wolf international religious freedom act. i want to especially thank anna eshoo, who is the principal democratic sponsor of this legislation, for her leadership and for working particularly in the middle east to combat the savagery that is being imposed upon people of minority faiths, including christians. {time} 1700 i thank her for her leadership and, again, for being the principal democrat on this bill. let me just note that naming this bill after frank wolf, who i consider to be, and many of us consider to be the william wilberforce of modern times, is an attempt to recognize his extraordinary life's work promoting human rights, 34 years as a member of congress, including, and especially, religious freedom. he now serves as the wilson chair at baylor, again, continuing his lifesaving work for religious believers all over the world. he just returned from nigeria and testified at our hearing last week. he was in the embattled states in northern nigeria, where boko haram runs free, massacring people. he was there on a fact-finding mission to promote religious freedom. mr. speaker, the frank r. wolf international religious freedom act that is before us is a series of upgrades to meet the challenges of the 21st century. we know that the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis of international religious freedom; a crisis that continues to create millions--no, tens of millions of victims; a crisis that undermines liberty, prosperity, and peace; a crisis that poses a direct challenge to the u.s. interests in the middle east, russia, china, sub-saharan africa, and elsewhere in the world. the pew research center notes that over 75 percent of the world's population today lives in countries where severe religious freedom abuses occur annually. according to pew, instances of anti-semitism are at a 7-year high. it is getting worse everywhere, particularly in the middle east, but also in europe and in the united states. mr. speaker, ancient christian communities in iraq and syria are on the verge of extinction, and other religious minorities in the middle east face a [[page h2405]] constant assault from the islamic state. several weeks ago, this congress passed a resolution, sponsored by jeff fortenberry, that was followed by a declaration by secretary of state john kerry, that said that isis has committed, and continues to commit genocide, mass atrocities and war crimes against christians, yazidis, and other minority faiths. we are on record. we know it is happening. we are speaking out. in a couple of weeks, i am chairing a hearing on what is next; what should we be doing next to combat this terrible, terrible crisis. in nigeria, the islamist terror group, boko haram, is believed to have killed over 6,600 people last year alone, mostly christian, but there are muslims as well who are being targeted. according to the testimony we received last week, since 2009, the number is about 15,000 year to date since 2009. mr. speaker, at one of those hearings a few years ago, i had a man named habila. habila, i met him at an idp camp in jos, nigeria, where a lot of churches have been firebombed. he told me this story. he was credible, and it checked out. and he came to congress and testified. boko haram put an ak-47--a terrorist--to his jaw and said: renounce christ or i will kill you. you must become a muslim on the spot. habila said: i am ready to meet my lord. and this terrorist pulled the trigger and blew most of his face away. what courage, what faith for a man. and when he told the story, you could have heard a pin drop. mr. speaker, the bipartisan u.s. commission on international religious freedom just released its 2016 annual report. and let me note, parenthetically, uscirf, or that commission, was also created by chairman wolf as part of irfa, the original bill. they have found that the abuses committed by governments and non- state actors has ``deteriorated.'' ``the incarceration of prisoners of conscience''--they point out--``remains astonishingly widespread . . .'' they point out that ``over the past year, the chinese government''-- as just one of many examples--``has stepped up its persecution of religious groups''--across the board: tibetans, uighurs, muslim uighurs, christians, and, of course, the falun gong. i spoke in mid-february at nyu, i gave a keynote there in shanghai, and talked about how xi jinping, the president of china, is in a race to the bottom with north korea to make religion absolutely subservient to the communist party. he calls it the sinification of religion; and what was already a bad situation has now become demonstrably worse. the frank r. wolf international religious freedom act will upgrade the tools so that this administration, and subsequent ones, can do an even better job to try to mitigate and, hopefully, end religious persecution. it does this by, one, requiring that international religious freedom policies be integrated into national security, immigration, rule of law, and other relevant u.s. foreign policies. it creates a designated persons list of individuals sanctioned for participating in or directing religious freedom abuses. it expands diplomatic training on international religious freedoms for all state department diplomats; creates a tier system for irfa, for the reports, not just countries of particular concern, of which there are currently 10, but also those that are on a watch list, those that are bad and, perhaps, getting worse. it gives the president authority to designate non-state actors in addition to countries; and it also requires the ambassador at large to report directly to the secretary of state. it also is increasingly clear that religious freedom diplomacy is really needed to advance u.s. interests around the world. this will do it. the legislation is backed by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops and the international religious freedom roundtable, a diverse and ecumenical group of individuals from the faith community. finally, just let me thank scott flipse, who worked for frank wolf previously, then he worked for the international religious freedom office at the state department, and now is working at the china commission; our general counsel, piero tozzi; janice kaguyutan, i thank her for her work on this; and sajit gandhi. this is a true, bipartisan piece of legislation and, hopefully, the senate will favorably receive it. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. again, mr. speaker, in closing, we focus on human rights as part of our foreign policy because it is the right thing to do. the united states is founded on the idea that an individual should be able to live according to his or her own beliefs. that is a value we want to see thriving around the world. advancing human rights is also the smart thing to do. countries with a strong respect for human rights are countries that prosper and play a constructive role on the global stage. i want to again say to my friend, the gentleman from new jersey (mr. smith), when he comes for advancing human rights, he takes a second seat to nobody. he is indefatigable when it comes to these things. in all the years i have known him, he has always been fair and honest. i really sincerely commend him, and know how heartfelt it is and how much we appreciate his hard work. when we see governments stifling religious freedom, or any freedom, we have a responsibility to speak out and make it clear that the united states remains a champion for these basic liberties. this bill helps us to live up to that responsibility, and i am proud to support it. i thank chairman royce and mr. smith. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from virginia (mrs. comstock), our esteemed colleague, who ably represents the district formerly served by frank wolf, who is honored in the title of this bill. representative barbara comstock is a coauthor of this bill with mr. smith, and i thank them both. mrs. comstock. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, ask human rights and religious freedom advocates to name their most steadfast friend who has served on capitol hill over the years, and representative frank wolf, my predecessor, is always on the short list, as are my colleagues here today. so i am honored today to stand in support of a bill i proudly cosponsored, the frank r. wolf international religious freedom act, named after the distinguished gentleman who served in this seat for the 10th district of virginia, and as the co-chair of the congressional human rights caucus, and a man whose deep faith and commitment to human rights and religion freedom were a large part of why he was known for years here and around the country, and even around the world, as the conscience of the congress. he wrote a book, a powerful book, titled a ``prisoner of conscience,'' about his many trips over the years and how he fought for religious freedom; and i hope he doesn't mind if i recommend that book to our listeners here. we continue to be blessed with congressman wolf's passionate leadership as he leads the 21st century wilberforce initiative to create a world where religious freedom is recognized by nations across the globe as a fundamental human right. since leaving congress, mr. wolf has continued to travel to the front lines to see, firsthand, the plight of ethnic minorities in iraq and syria, including christians, yazidis, kurds, and other minority religious groups. as previously mentioned, he has just returned from nigeria. he continues to shine a light every day on the dark places where men and women and children, even, of faith are victimized, tortured and, tragically, even killed for their faith. he will not let the world look away, and we thank him for his continued work and his strong and much- needed voice. now this legislation amends his own legislation to continue that mission that mr. wolf so valiantly fought for for 3 decades here in congress. it will improve the ability of the united states to advance religious freedom globally, with stronger and more flexible political responses to a disturbing and growing denial of basic religious freedoms around the world. [[page h2406]] as has been said by many, frank wolf is the william wilberforce of our day. he is, and has always been, a voice for the voiceless. he once said: ``most would agree that conscience rights figure prominently in the narrative of america's founding. historically, americans and our corresponding institutions have recognized that conscience is not ultimately allegiant to the state, but to something, and for many people, someone, higher.'' i appreciate the opportunity today to continue that legacy with the passing of this important legislation which will continue his important and vital mission and legacy; and that is needed now, more than ever, for so many of the reasons that my colleagues here have highlighted. i thank the gentleman so much for the privilege of addressing and cosponsoring this legislation. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to this bill and to today's debate, especially mr. smith, congresswoman barbara comstock and mr. engel. the right to believe and practice one's religion according to the dictates of conscience is often called the first freedom. it is one of the founding ideas of our nation, but we do not believe that it is only an american value. rather, this is what we believe here. we believe it flows from the inherent dignity of every human person, and it deserves protection everywhere. in today's world, those who are most violently opposed to religious freedom also pose the biggest threat to our nation. they also pose the biggest threat to civilization worldwide. thus, the promotion of religious liberty is not some isolated human rights concern. no. it is a key component of our national security. and this bill, now authored by mr. smith, h.r. 1150, contains important updates to the international religious freedom act of 1998 that will enhance the effectiveness of the united states' efforts to promote that liberty around the world, so it deserves our unanimous support. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 1150, amending the frank wolf international religious freedom act. i support this measure because the right to freedom of religion has been a cornerstone of the american conscience. many of our country's first leaders fled religious persecution abroad and went on to establish laws protecting religious freedom. this core belief of our great nation does not stop at our national borders; we offer refuge to those suffering from religious persecution throughout the world. a testament to this commitment was the international religious freedom act of 1998 which was a landmark piece of legislation seeking to make religious freedom a higher priority in u.s. foreign policy. the act was approved by congress unanimously in 1998 and signed into law by president clinton. the act condemns violations of religious freedom and promotes and assists other governments in the promotion of the fundamental right to freedom of religion. while strides have been made in establishing worldwide practice of freedom of religion, it is currently under attack. let me also note that people are being prosecuted under blasphemy laws for freedom of expression, which is why i introduced the bipartisan measure h. res. 290, calling for the global repeal of blasphemy laws. i support h.r. 1150 because we must continue to work to preserve religious freedoms as well as making sure that religion is not a pretext for prosecution or persecution in the world. indeed, one of the key amendments to irfa would be to relocate the office of international religious freedom within the office of the secretary of state. this action would allow for greater coordination of strategic focus and the minimization of duplicated efforts, streamline mandates, and centralize efforts to engage religious communities and promote human rights more generally in regards to religious freedom. currently, the office is headed by the ambassador at-large for international religious freedom which monitors religious persecution and discrimination worldwide to develop policy recommendations, programs, and awareness. besides being placed in the secretary of state's office, the ambassador at large would be able to make every effort to collaborate and coordinate across all u.s. agencies and departments to formulate strategic religious freedom policies, programs, and activities. these two changes will provide a greater ability for us to advance religious freedom throughout the world. h.r. 1150 will also allow us to assist emerging democracies to implement freedom of religion while also helping older partners maintain their freedom of religion practices and conscience. h.r. 1150 calls to ensure that our diplomats and foreign policy experts are well versed in the importance of religious freedom and how to address atrocities related to religion. h.r. 1150 also addresses how to improve our ability to promote freedom of religion by enhancing the capabilities and knowledge of our diplomats. our foreign service officers (fso) are on the front lines everyday carrying out american foreign policy while also shaping it, which makes sure that they are adequately trained on religious freedom. h.r. 1150 directs the secretary to develop mandatory religious freedom training for all foreign service officers. this major change will enhance fso capabilities to identify severe persecutors to help assemble the ambassador's annual report on international religious freedom. in addition to the annual report, h.r. 1150 calls for an updated lists of persons that are currently being persecuted and forced to renounce their faith. this is essential in bringing awareness to countries that need to be monitored or that have non-state actors that have high levels of detainment, disappearance, torture, or murder based on someone's religion. another key aspect of h.r. 1150 is to enhance engagement and coordination with the executive branch on issues pertaining to international religious freedom policies and global religion engagement strategies. this would be achieved through amendment of the national security act of 1947, calling for the appointment of a special adviser for global religious engagement and establishing the interagency policy committee on religious freedom and engagement. mr. speaker, i urge all members to support adequate funding in order to enable rapid and decisive efforts of supporting democracy and preservation of human rights. the speaker pro tempore (mr. smith of nebraska). the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from california (mr. royce) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1150, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",68019

This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland Security Strategy for International Programs Act''. SEC. 2. COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR VETTING AND SCREENING PERSONS SEEKING TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES. (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a comprehensive three-year strategy for international programs of the Department of Homeland Security in which personnel and resources of the Department are deployed abroad for vetting and screening of persons seeking to enter the United States. (b) Contents.--The strategy required under subsection (a) shall include, at a minimum, the following: [[Page H2412]] (1) Specific Department of Homeland Security risk-based goals for international programs of the Department in which personnel and resources of the Department are deployed abroad for vetting and screening of persons seeking to enter the United States. (2) A risk-based method for determining whether to establish new international programs in new locations, given resource constraints, or expand existing international programs of the Department, in which personnel and resources of the Department are deployed abroad for vetting and screening of persons seeking to enter the United States.

(2) The number of Department personnel deployed to each location at which an international program referred to in subparagraph (A) is in operation during the current and preceding fiscal year. (3) Analysis of the impact of each international program referred to in paragraph (1) on domestic activities of components of the Department of Homeland Security. (4) Analysis of barriers to the expansion of an international program referred to in paragraph (1). (d) Form.--The strategy required under subsection (a) shall be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that such is appropriate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4780, the Department of Homeland Security Strategy for International Programs Act, offered by the ranking member of the committee, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson). This bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report to Congress on the Department of Homeland Security's international programs, including the vetting and screening of persons seeking to enter the United States. {time} 1745 The legislation builds off of recommendations made by the Committee on Homeland Security's bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel that identified security gaps which allow jihadists to get to and from Iraq and Syria undetected. Specifically, the task force recommended that U.S. authorities continue to push the border outward by deploying homeland security initiatives overseas. The DHS has established several international programs that are designed to thoroughly vet and screen such individuals before their travel to the United States. Through its many international programs, the DHS personnel overseas effectively extends our Nation's borders to increase the security of the United States. Expanding initiatives like the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Preclearance program or Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Visa Security Program could help detect and interdict threats before they are bound for the homeland. For example, the Preclearance program allows overseas-based CBP officers to screen all passengers and luggage before a flight takes off for the United States. The CBP currently has 15 preclearance locations in six countries, including Ireland, Aruba, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates. However, the foreign fighter threat and travel patterns continue to concern immigration and national security officials. As a result, DHS has announced plans to expand preclearance operations. Other programs, like ICE's Visa Security Program deploy specially trained agents to diplomatic posts worldwide to conduct additional visa security screening and quickly identify potential terrorists or criminal threats before they reach the United States. Agents provide an additional level of review for persons of special interest or concern, review visa applications, liaise with host country immigration and border security officials, and conduct investigations with a nexus to U.S. travel and security. The program has agents posted at consulates and embassies in more than 25 countries, with additional plans to expand to additional high-risk locations. As the Department of Homeland Security continues to build its international footprint for these and other border security programs, the DHS must ensure that the expansion of international programs is considered with risk, cost, and benefit in mind. This bill would require the DHS to report on the specific risk-based goals for these international programs to ensure that they align with Department-wide and government-wide strategic priorities. This additional transparency, including the costs related to international programs, will improve Congress' oversight of these activities. Additionally, the Department will be required to consider how the deployment of personnel abroad may impact its domestic capabilities as well as to identify barriers for the expansion of international programs. While international programs provide tangible national security and travel facilitation benefits, the growing DHS presence overseas should be built upon the foundation of a long-term strategy that guides the Department in the deployment of officers and agents in a risk-based manner. I am confident that the comprehensive strategy that is required by this bill will help ensure that the Department is managing these programs effectively and that Congress has the appropriate insight that is necessary to protect the American taxpayers' investment in our security. I, therefore, urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4780, the Department of Homeland Security Strategy for International Programs Act. I introduced H.R. 4780 to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a comprehensive strategy for the Department's international programs where personnel and resources are deployed abroad for vetting and screening persons who are seeking to enter the U.S. In recent years, the Department has expanded its international footprint through programs such as the Immigration Advisory Program, the Joint Security Program, and the Visa Security Program. In fact, presently, the Customs and Border Protection has, approximately, 800 employees who are posted in 43 countries, and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement has almost 400 employees in 45 countries. DHS personnel who are at overseas locations perform vital vetting and passenger prescreening activities to ensure individuals who are traveling to the U.S. do not pose a threat to our Nation's security. Looking ahead, the DHS has announced plans to expand the Preclearance program to 10 new locations in the coming years, and ICE continues to expand its Visa Security Program to additional visa-issuing posts abroad. I strongly support these efforts to push out our borders through the expansion of these important homeland [[Page H2413]] security programs. That said, to do it right, DHS needs a comprehensive strategy to bolster its presence and partnerships around the world. My bill requires just that. Specifically, it requires the DHS to have a 3- year strategy that includes risk-based goals, which is a process to ensure resource allocations align with overall Departmental strategic priorities, and a common reporting framework for personnel who are deployed abroad. My bill requires the DHS to not only take into account where it currently deploys resources for these overseas screening and vetting programs and the number of DHS personnel at each location, but also any impacts of these overseas activities on domestic operations, including with respect to staffing at U.S. ports of entry. After 9/11, the attempted Christmas Day attack in 2009, as well as other more recent cases, it is imperative for the DHS and its Federal partners to bolster the screening and vetting of travelers before they arrive at our borders. My bill will help ensure that the DHS has a sound strategy for its efforts to do so. Mr. Speaker, we face evolving terrorist threats, which include individuals who are attempting to use legitimate forms of travel to the U.S. to inflict harm. The DHS personnel who are posted abroad perform critical preemptive operations to make sure that travelers who are coming to our country are thoroughly screened and vetted. H.R. 4780 will help ensure that these important international DHS programs are utilized in a strategic and effective manner to further enhance the security of the U.S. Before I yield back, I would note that H.R. 4780 is a part of a larger legislative package that I am introducing today. Among other things, my package would authorize significant expansions of critical CBP and ICE overseas screening and vetting programs and significant new CBP staffing resources to support overseas program expansion and address domestic staffing shortages at U.S. international airports. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4780. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4780. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4780, the ``Department of Homeland Security Strategy for International Programs Act.'' This legislation directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to submit a comprehensive three-year strategy for international programs in which DHS personnel and resources are deployed abroad for vetting and screening persons seeking to enter the United States. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security I support this bill because the issue of proper vetting and screening processes' upon the entry into the country is paramount. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4780 directs the Security Committee of the Department of Homeland Security to use the following strategies to implement this legislation: 1. A risk-based method for determining whether to establish new international programs in new locations, given resource constraints, or expand existing international programs; 2. Alignment with the highest DHS-wide and government-wide strategic priorities of resource allocations on such programs; and 3. A common reporting framework for the submission of reliable, comparable cost data by DHS components on overseas expenditures attributable to such programs. In developing this strategy the Department for health and human services shall secure: 1. Information on existing operations of DHS programs that includes corresponding information for each location in which each such program operates, 2. Analysis of the impact of each such international program on domestic activities of DHS components, 3. The number of DHS personnel deployed to each location at which such an international program is in operation during the current and preceding fiscal year, and 4. Analysis of barriers to the expansion of such an international program. There should be a proper vetting and screening process for individuals entering the country from locations abroad. Border security is an evolving process, and our legislative process must evolve with it. Avoiding recurrences of attacks on the homeland such as the 911 attack is a major reason entry into the country should be heavily monitored. I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 4780. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4780, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2411-H2413] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY STRATEGY FOR INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS ACT Mr. RATCLIFFE.

(a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a comprehensive three-year strategy for international programs of the Department of Homeland Security in which personnel and resources of the Department are deployed abroad for vetting and screening of persons seeking to enter the United States. (b) Contents.--The strategy required under subsection (a) shall include, at a minimum, the following: [[Page H2412]] (1) Specific Department of Homeland Security risk-based goals for international programs of the Department in which personnel and resources of the Department are deployed abroad for vetting and screening of persons seeking to enter the United States. (2) A risk-based method for determining whether to establish new international programs in new locations, given resource constraints, or expand existing international programs of the Department, in which personnel and resources of the Department are deployed abroad for vetting and screening of persons seeking to enter the United States. (3) Alignment with the highest Department-wide and Government-wide strategic priorities of resource allocations on international programs of the Department in which personnel and resources of the Department are deployed abroad for vetting and screening of persons seeking to enter the United States. (4) A common reporting framework for the submission of reliable, comparable cost data by components of the Department on overseas expenditures attributable to international programs of the Department in which personnel and resources of the Department are deployed abroad for vetting and screening of persons seeking to enter the United States. (c) Considerations.--In developing the strategy required under subsection (a), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consider, at a minimum, the following: (1) Information on existing operations of international programs of the Department of Homeland Security in which personnel and resources of the Department are deployed abroad for vetting and screening of persons seeking to enter the United States that includes corresponding information for each location in which each such program operates. (2) The number of Department personnel deployed to each location at which an international program referred to in subparagraph (A) is in operation during the current and preceding fiscal year. (3) Analysis of the impact of each international program referred to in paragraph (1) on domestic activities of components of the Department of Homeland Security. (4) Analysis of barriers to the expansion of an international program referred to in paragraph (1). (d) Form.--The strategy required under subsection (a) shall be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that such is appropriate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4780, the Department of Homeland Security Strategy for International Programs Act, offered by the ranking member of the committee, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson). This bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report to Congress on the Department of Homeland Security's international programs, including the vetting and screening of persons seeking to enter the United States. {time} 1745 The legislation builds off of recommendations made by the Committee on Homeland Security's bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel that identified security gaps which allow jihadists to get to and from Iraq and Syria undetected. Specifically, the task force recommended that U.S. authorities continue to push the border outward by deploying homeland security initiatives overseas. The DHS has established several international programs that are designed to thoroughly vet and screen such individuals before their travel to the United States. Through its many international programs, the DHS personnel overseas effectively extends our Nation's borders to increase the security of the United States. Expanding initiatives like the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Preclearance program or Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Visa Security Program could help detect and interdict threats before they are bound for the homeland. For example, the Preclearance program allows overseas-based CBP officers to screen all passengers and luggage before a flight takes off for the United States. The CBP currently has 15 preclearance locations in six countries, including Ireland, Aruba, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates. However, the foreign fighter threat and travel patterns continue to concern immigration and national security officials. As a result, DHS has announced plans to expand preclearance operations. Other programs, like ICE's Visa Security Program deploy specially trained agents to diplomatic posts worldwide to conduct additional visa security screening and quickly identify potential terrorists or criminal threats before they reach the United States. Agents provide an additional level of review for persons of special interest or concern, review visa applications, liaise with host country immigration and border security officials, and conduct investigations with a nexus to U.S. travel and security. The program has agents posted at consulates and embassies in more than 25 countries, with additional plans to expand to additional high-risk locations. As the Department of Homeland Security continues to build its international footprint for these and other border security programs, the DHS must ensure that the expansion of international programs is considered with risk, cost, and benefit in mind. This bill would require the DHS to report on the specific risk-based goals for these international programs to ensure that they align with Department-wide and government-wide strategic priorities. This additional transparency, including the costs related to international programs, will improve Congress' oversight of these activities. Additionally, the Department will be required to consider how the deployment of personnel abroad may impact its domestic capabilities as well as to identify barriers for the expansion of international programs. While international programs provide tangible national security and travel facilitation benefits, the growing DHS presence overseas should be built upon the foundation of a long-term strategy that guides the Department in the deployment of officers and agents in a risk-based manner. I am confident that the comprehensive strategy that is required by this bill will help ensure that the Department is managing these programs effectively and that Congress has the appropriate insight that is necessary to protect the American taxpayers' investment in our security. I, therefore, urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4780, the Department of Homeland Security Strategy for International Programs Act. I introduced H.R. 4780 to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a comprehensive strategy for the Department's international programs where personnel and resources are deployed abroad for vetting and screening persons who are seeking to enter the U.S. In recent years, the Department has expanded its international footprint through programs such as the Immigration Advisory Program, the Joint Security Program, and the Visa Security Program. In fact, presently, the Customs and Border Protection has, approximately, 800 employees who are posted in 43 countries, and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement has almost 400 employees in 45 countries. DHS personnel who are at overseas locations perform vital vetting and passenger prescreening activities to ensure individuals who are traveling to the U.S. do not pose a threat to our Nation's security. Looking ahead, the DHS has announced plans to expand the Preclearance program to 10 new locations in the coming years, and ICE continues to expand its Visa Security Program to additional visa-issuing posts abroad. I strongly support these efforts to push out our borders through the expansion of these important homeland [[Page H2413]] security programs. That said, to do it right, DHS needs a comprehensive strategy to bolster its presence and partnerships around the world. My bill requires just that. Specifically, it requires the DHS to have a 3- year strategy that includes risk-based goals, which is a process to ensure resource allocations align with overall Departmental strategic priorities, and a common reporting framework for personnel who are deployed abroad. My bill requires the DHS to not only take into account where it currently deploys resources for these overseas screening and vetting programs and the number of DHS personnel at each location, but also any impacts of these overseas activities on domestic operations, including with respect to staffing at U.S. ports of entry. After 9/11, the attempted Christmas Day attack in 2009, as well as other more recent cases, it is imperative for the DHS and its Federal partners to bolster the screening and vetting of travelers before they arrive at our borders. My bill will help ensure that the DHS has a sound strategy for its efforts to do so. Mr. Speaker, we face evolving terrorist threats, which include individuals who are attempting to use legitimate forms of travel to the U.S. to inflict harm. The DHS personnel who are posted abroad perform critical preemptive operations to make sure that travelers who are coming to our country are thoroughly screened and vetted. H.R. 4780 will help ensure that these important international DHS programs are utilized in a strategic and effective manner to further enhance the security of the U.S. Before I yield back, I would note that H.R. 4780 is a part of a larger legislative package that I am introducing today. Among other things, my package would authorize significant expansions of critical CBP and ICE overseas screening and vetting programs and significant new CBP staffing resources to support overseas program expansion and address domestic staffing shortages at U.S. international airports. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4780. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4780. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4780, the ``Department of Homeland Security Strategy for International Programs Act.'' This legislation directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to submit a comprehensive three-year strategy for international programs in which DHS personnel and resources are deployed abroad for vetting and screening persons seeking to enter the United States. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security I support this bill because the issue of proper vetting and screening processes' upon the entry into the country is paramount. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4780 directs the Security Committee of the Department of Homeland Security to use the following strategies to implement this legislation: 1. A risk-based method for determining whether to establish new international programs in new locations, given resource constraints, or expand existing international programs; 2. Alignment with the highest DHS-wide and government-wide strategic priorities of resource allocations on such programs; and 3. A common reporting framework for the submission of reliable, comparable cost data by DHS components on overseas expenditures attributable to such programs. In developing this strategy the Department for health and human services shall secure: 1. Information on existing operations of DHS programs that includes corresponding information for each location in which each such program operates, 2. Analysis of the impact of each such international program on domestic activities of DHS components, 3. The number of DHS personnel deployed to each location at which such an international program is in operation during the current and preceding fiscal year, and 4. Analysis of barriers to the expansion of such an international program. There should be a proper vetting and screening process for individuals entering the country from locations abroad. Border security is an evolving process, and our legislative process must evolve with it. Avoiding recurrences of attacks on the homeland such as the 911 attack is a major reason entry into the country should be heavily monitored. I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 4780. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4780, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_176.csv,14858,14858,14923,"[congressional record volume 162, number 77 (monday, may 16, 2016)] [house] [pages h2411-h2413] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] department of homeland security strategy for international programs act mr. ratcliffe. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 4780) to require the secretary of homeland security to develop a comprehensive strategy for department of homeland security operations abroad, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 4780 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``department of homeland security strategy for international programs act''. sec. 2. comprehensive strategy for international programs for vetting and screening persons seeking to enter the united states.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4743) to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4743 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY PREPAREDNESS CONSORTIUM.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to [[Page H2410]] revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4743. The National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016 allows the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to work with a consortium, including the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, to support efforts to address cybersecurity risks and incidents. This bill allows DHS to engage with a consortium to assist the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, or NCCIC, in providing training to State and local first responders in preparing for and responding to cybersecurity risks and incidents. An example of a consortium DHS may work with under this bill is the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, or NCPC. The NCPC provides State and local communities with the tools they need to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber attacks. The consortium also evaluates communities' cybersecurity posture and provides them with a roadmap to correct deficiencies in the security of their information systems. Based out of the University of Texas at San Antonio's Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security, the NCPC membership includes the University of Arkansas, the University of Memphis, Norwich University, and Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service. DHS is responsible for carrying out significant aspects of the Federal Government's cybersecurity mission. The Cybersecurity Act, which was recently signed into law, allows DHS to actively share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures with the private sector by affording liability protections. DHS's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center is responsible for facilitating cross-sector coordination to address cybersecurity risks and incidents. H.R. 4743 allows DHS to work with any consortium, including the NCPC, in a number of activities, including providing technical assistance, conducting cross-sector cybersecurity training and simulation exercises, and helping States and local communities to develop cybersecurity information sharing programs. Allowing DHS to work with organizations already supporting State and local cyber preparedness and response will provide additional support to State and local entities. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4743, the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4743 allows the Department of Homeland Security to utilize university-based consortia to help provide cybersecurity training and support to State, local, and tribal leaders, including first responders. There is strong bipartisan support for this legislation, as introduced by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro). H.R. 4743 authorizes DHS to use consortia to provide State and local governments with university-developed cyber training and technical assistance, including for the development of cyber information sharing that jurisdictions in need can use. Recent studies reveal that organizations at the State and local level describe their cybersecurity programs as being in the early and middle stages of maturity, and 86 percent of State and local respondents identified managing cybersecurity risk as one of their most stressful jobs. By partnering with consortia, DHS can make a meaningful impact on raising the levels of cybersecurity on the State, local, and tribal levels. Importantly, H.R. 4743 requires DHS, when selecting a consortium for participation in its cyber efforts, to not only take into account the prior experience of the institutions that would be conducting cybersecurity training exercises, but also the geographic diversity of the institutions participating in the consortium. The inclusion of geographic diversity should help reach more States and localities. Moreover, I am pleased that the bill requires DHS to do outreach to colleges and universities, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and other minority-serving institutions about opportunities to provide research-based cybersecurity-related training exercises and technical assistance. Mr. Speaker, States and localities need the ability to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber events as they would have any other disaster or emergency situation. For this reason, I support H.R. 4743 and urge passage. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd), my distinguished friend and colleague. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue and for yielding me some time. I would like to also thank the ranking member and my colleague from San Antonio on this piece of legislation that is so important to our hometown. It is no secret that cyber attacks are on the rise, and the unfortunate reality is that everyone is vulnerable. The costs of protecting your network and properly training communities on best practices in a digital world can be burdensome. As we all know, State and local communities, in many instances, do not possess the same digital resources as the Federal Government. States and communities need the ability to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber events just as they would any other disaster or emergency situation. That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 4743, which will allow DHS to coordinate with a handful of universities that have been leading the way in cyber preparedness. One of these universities, the University of Texas at San Antonio, is located in my hometown and serves many of my constituents. Another leader in this field is none other than my alma mater, Texas A&M University. Building upon their great work and the breakthroughs of others across the country will be crucial to protecting our digital infrastructure at all levels. This will help us ensure that our first responders and government entities are adequately prepared for a significant cyber event. I thank my colleague from Texas for his attention to this issue. I fully support H.R. 4743, the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro), the author of this bill. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Thompson for yielding me this time and for his support of this legislation. He and his staff have been terrific partners in moving this bill forward. I would also like to thank my fellow Texans, Chairman McCaul, Congressman Hurd, Congressman Ratcliffe, and also Congressman Richmond, who is not a Texan, but is a wonderful person here in our body, for all of their work on this issue. Every day our Nation faces a growing number of potentially debilitating cyber threats. Our retailers, our banks, government agencies, military operations, and everyday private American citizens all face these threats. We must ensure that our defenses are as strong as possible because of that. I represent San Antonio, a national leader in the cybersecurity field. Institutions in San Antonio do cutting-edge cyber work that keeps our Nation safe. For example, the University of Texas at San Antonio leads the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, which helps communities across the Nation improve their cyber defenses. It is critical that localities understand the impact cyber attacks could have on their ability to function and are prepared to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from harmful cyber incidents. UTSA and its cybersecurity consortium are educating communities about these cyber threats and helping them develop the defenses they need to successfully withstand a cyber emergency. [[Page H2411]] This legislation allows consortiums like UTSAs to work more closely with DHS to address cybersecurity risks and incidents at the State and local level. This collaboration will bolster our cyber preparedness and keep us one step ahead of cyber attackers. Mr. Speaker, again I would like to thank the Homeland Security Committee's leadership for their partnership on this legislation and also all of the staff, both Republican and Democratic, who helped bring this to the floor. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the inspiration for this bill was important work being done by the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, a group of five universities led by the University of Texas at San Antonio that has helped to raise cyber preparedness at the State and local level by evaluating communities, cybersecurity postures, and providing them with a roadmap to correct deficiencies. While this consortium is making an important contribution to cybersecurity, there is an enormous need for training and technical assistance around the Nation. With the enactment of H.R. 4743, more institutions will be able to partner with DHS to provide such critical assistance. As such, I urge passage. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4743. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4743, the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016. This bill allows the Department of Homeland Security to work with a cybersecurity consortium to carry out training, technical assistance and simulation exercises for State and local officials, critical infrastructure owners and operators and private industry. The National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, based at the University of Texas San Antonio's Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security, provides research-based cybersecurity-related training and exercises to increase cybersecurity preparedness across the nation. Other members of the Consortium include the Texas Engineering Extension Service in the Texas A&M University system, the University of Memphis, the University of Arkansas System, and Norwich University. Last December, I helped usher through the landmark Cybersecurity Act of 2015. That legislation helps protect our nation's private sector and federal networks which are under continuous threat from foreign hackers and cyber terrorists. H.R. 4743 will be a value add in better securing the Nation's overall cybersecurity preparedness. Locally, first responders and government officials as well as critical infrastructure owners and operators and private industry are bombarded with cybersecurity threats in the same way as at the federal level. Helping organizations working to incorporate cybersecurity risk and incident prevention and response into State and local emergency plans is just one of the elements this bill encourages. Allowing DHS to work with organizations like the Consortium, will ensure more tools are available back at home for those working to prepare for and combat cyber attacks on a regular basis. I support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4743, the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016, because it will establish an important resource to ensure that private sector entities are better prepared to protect against cyber threats. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am well aware of the threats posed by cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and this bill takes an essential step to strengthen domestic cybersecurity. H.R. 4743 establishes a National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium to engage academic, nonprofit, private industry, and federal, state, and local government partners to address cybersecurity risks and incidents, including threats or acts of terrorism. The Consortium may provide training to State and local first responders and officials to equip them with the tools and skills needed to prepare for and respond to cybersecurity risks and incidents, including threats and acts of terrorism, in accordance with current law. I thank both Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for the bipartisan work done to bring the bill before the House for Consideration. I am pleased that during the Committee markup of H.R. 4743, two important Jackson Lee Amendments were adopted. The first Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R. 4743 establishes metrics as a measure of the effectiveness of the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium program. Having the information provided by my amendment to H.R. 4743, will allow the Congressional oversight committees to better plan future programs around cybersecurity collaborations that are intended to share knowledge on best practices in securing computer networks from attack. The second Jackson Lee Amendment added an additional objective of the bill, a directive that should help participants prepare to address continuity of operations. This amendment provides a focus for the Consortium's work on the issue of continuity of operation, which addresses whether an entity can survive a cyber-attack, continue to provide information or services during an attack; or the likelihood that the time to recovery from a successful cyberattack or threat is predictable and reasonable. Just as the attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001 came without notice so may a major cyber-attack. In March, of this year, U.S. Attorney General Lynch announced ``wanted'' notices for a group of Iranian hackers the United States believes are behind a 2013 computer intrusion of a small New York dam and a series of cyberattacks on dozens of U.S. banks. There are many companies offering continuity of operations services to companies large and small with the intent that they will be there to support their clients in the event of a cyber incident. The work of the Consortium should go beyond planning to the answering questions regarding the operationalization of plans in the event of an attack or cyber incident. We know that planning is crucial, but we must encourage cybersecurity planning to go beyond the planning process to understand the capacity of an entity's continuity of operations plans by looking at continuity of operations of service providers should an incident impact an area or industry. I support H.R. 4743, because it provides this assurance by providing critical cybersecurity collaboration among experts and industries that are essential to critical infrastructure operations or have a significant economic presence in our nation's economy that a cyber- attack would have broad repercussions. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4743. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4743, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2409-H2411] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY PREPAREDNESS CONSORTIUM ACT OF 2016 Mr. RATCLIFFE.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to [[Page H2410]] revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4743. The National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016 allows the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to work with a consortium, including the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, to support efforts to address cybersecurity risks and incidents. This bill allows DHS to engage with a consortium to assist the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, or NCCIC, in providing training to State and local first responders in preparing for and responding to cybersecurity risks and incidents. An example of a consortium DHS may work with under this bill is the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, or NCPC. The NCPC provides State and local communities with the tools they need to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber attacks. The consortium also evaluates communities' cybersecurity posture and provides them with a roadmap to correct deficiencies in the security of their information systems. Based out of the University of Texas at San Antonio's Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security, the NCPC membership includes the University of Arkansas, the University of Memphis, Norwich University, and Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service. DHS is responsible for carrying out significant aspects of the Federal Government's cybersecurity mission. The Cybersecurity Act, which was recently signed into law, allows DHS to actively share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures with the private sector by affording liability protections. DHS's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center is responsible for facilitating cross-sector coordination to address cybersecurity risks and incidents. H.R. 4743 allows DHS to work with any consortium, including the NCPC, in a number of activities, including providing technical assistance, conducting cross-sector cybersecurity training and simulation exercises, and helping States and local communities to develop cybersecurity information sharing programs. Allowing DHS to work with organizations already supporting State and local cyber preparedness and response will provide additional support to State and local entities. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4743, the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4743 allows the Department of Homeland Security to utilize university-based consortia to help provide cybersecurity training and support to State, local, and tribal leaders, including first responders. There is strong bipartisan support for this legislation, as introduced by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro). H.R. 4743 authorizes DHS to use consortia to provide State and local governments with university-developed cyber training and technical assistance, including for the development of cyber information sharing that jurisdictions in need can use. Recent studies reveal that organizations at the State and local level describe their cybersecurity programs as being in the early and middle stages of maturity, and 86 percent of State and local respondents identified managing cybersecurity risk as one of their most stressful jobs. By partnering with consortia, DHS can make a meaningful impact on raising the levels of cybersecurity on the State, local, and tribal levels. Importantly, H.R. 4743 requires DHS, when selecting a consortium for participation in its cyber efforts, to not only take into account the prior experience of the institutions that would be conducting cybersecurity training exercises, but also the geographic diversity of the institutions participating in the consortium. The inclusion of geographic diversity should help reach more States and localities. Moreover, I am pleased that the bill requires DHS to do outreach to colleges and universities, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and other minority-serving institutions about opportunities to provide research-based cybersecurity-related training exercises and technical assistance. Mr. Speaker, States and localities need the ability to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber events as they would have any other disaster or emergency situation. For this reason, I support H.R. 4743 and urge passage. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd), my distinguished friend and colleague. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue and for yielding me some time. I would like to also thank the ranking member and my colleague from San Antonio on this piece of legislation that is so important to our hometown. It is no secret that cyber attacks are on the rise, and the unfortunate reality is that everyone is vulnerable. The costs of protecting your network and properly training communities on best practices in a digital world can be burdensome. As we all know, State and local communities, in many instances, do not possess the same digital resources as the Federal Government. States and communities need the ability to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber events just as they would any other disaster or emergency situation.

Recent studies reveal that organizations at the State and local level describe their cybersecurity programs as being in the early and middle stages of maturity, and 86 percent of State and local respondents identified managing cybersecurity risk as one of their most stressful jobs. By partnering with consortia, DHS can make a meaningful impact on raising the levels of cybersecurity on the State, local, and tribal levels. Importantly, H.R. 4743 requires DHS, when selecting a consortium for participation in its cyber efforts, to not only take into account the prior experience of the institutions that would be conducting cybersecurity training exercises, but also the geographic diversity of the institutions participating in the consortium. The inclusion of geographic diversity should help reach more States and localities. Moreover, I am pleased that the bill requires DHS to do outreach to colleges and universities, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and other minority-serving institutions about opportunities to provide research-based cybersecurity-related training exercises and technical assistance. Mr. Speaker, States and localities need the ability to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber events as they would have any other disaster or emergency situation. For this reason, I support H.R. 4743 and urge passage. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd), my distinguished friend and colleague. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue and for yielding me some time. I would like to also thank the ranking member and my colleague from San Antonio on this piece of legislation that is so important to our hometown. It is no secret that cyber attacks are on the rise, and the unfortunate reality is that everyone is vulnerable. The costs of protecting your network and properly training communities on best practices in a digital world can be burdensome. As we all know, State and local communities, in many instances, do not possess the same digital resources as the Federal Government. States and communities need the ability to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber events just as they would any other disaster or emergency situation. That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 4743, which will allow DHS to coordinate with a handful of universities that have been leading the way in cyber preparedness. One of these universities, the University of Texas at San Antonio, is located in my hometown and serves many of my constituents. Another leader in this field is none other than my alma mater, Texas A&M University. Building upon their great work and the breakthroughs of others across the country will be crucial to protecting our digital infrastructure at all levels. This will help us ensure that our first responders and government entities are adequately prepared for a significant cyber event. I thank my colleague from Texas for his attention to this issue. I fully support H.R. 4743, the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro), the author of this bill. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Thompson for yielding me this time and for his support of this legislation. He and his staff have been terrific partners in moving this bill forward. I would also like to thank my fellow Texans, Chairman McCaul, Congressman Hurd, Congressman Ratcliffe, and also Congressman Richmond, who is not a Texan, but is a wonderful person here in our body, for all of their work on this issue. Every day our Nation faces a growing number of potentially debilitating cyber threats. Our retailers, our banks, government agencies, military operations, and everyday private American citizens all face these threats. We must ensure that our defenses are as strong as possible because of that. I represent San Antonio, a national leader in the cybersecurity field. Institutions in San Antonio do cutting-edge cyber work that keeps our Nation safe. For example, the University of Texas at San Antonio leads the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, which helps communities across the Nation improve their cyber defenses. It is critical that localities understand the impact cyber attacks could have on their ability to function and are prepared to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from harmful cyber incidents. UTSA and its cybersecurity consortium are educating communities about these cyber threats and helping them develop the defenses they need to successfully withstand a cyber emergency. [[Page H2411]] This legislation allows consortiums like UTSAs to work more closely with DHS to address cybersecurity risks and incidents at the State and local level. This collaboration will bolster our cyber preparedness and keep us one step ahead of cyber attackers. Mr. Speaker, again I would like to thank the Homeland Security Committee's leadership for their partnership on this legislation and also all of the staff, both Republican and Democratic, who helped bring this to the floor. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the inspiration for this bill was important work being done by the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, a group of five universities led by the University of Texas at San Antonio that has helped to raise cyber preparedness at the State and local level by evaluating communities, cybersecurity postures, and providing them with a roadmap to correct deficiencies. While this consortium is making an important contribution to cybersecurity, there is an enormous need for training and technical assistance around the Nation. With the enactment of H.R. 4743, more institutions will be able to partner with DHS to provide such critical assistance. As such, I urge passage. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4743. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4743, the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016. This bill allows the Department of Homeland Security to work with a cybersecurity consortium to carry out training, technical assistance and simulation exercises for State and local officials, critical infrastructure owners and operators and private industry. The National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, based at the University of Texas San Antonio's Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security, provides research-based cybersecurity-related training and exercises to increase cybersecurity preparedness across the nation. Other members of the Consortium include the Texas Engineering Extension Service in the Texas A&M University system, the University of Memphis, the University of Arkansas System, and Norwich University. Last December, I helped usher through the landmark Cybersecurity Act of 2015. That legislation helps protect our nation's private sector and federal networks which are under continuous threat from foreign hackers and cyber terrorists. H.R. 4743 will be a value add in better securing the Nation's overall cybersecurity preparedness. Locally, first responders and government officials as well as critical infrastructure owners and operators and private industry are bombarded with cybersecurity threats in the same way as at the federal level. Helping organizations working to incorporate cybersecurity risk and incident prevention and response into State and local emergency plans is just one of the elements this bill encourages. Allowing DHS to work with organizations like the Consortium, will ensure more tools are available back at home for those working to prepare for and combat cyber attacks on a regular basis. I support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4743, the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2016, because it will establish an important resource to ensure that private sector entities are better prepared to protect against cyber threats. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am well aware of the threats posed by cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and this bill takes an essential step to strengthen domestic cybersecurity. H.R. 4743 establishes a National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium to engage academic, nonprofit, private industry, and federal, state, and local government partners to address cybersecurity risks and incidents, including threats or acts of terrorism. The Consortium may provide training to State and local first responders and officials to equip them with the tools and skills needed to prepare for and respond to cybersecurity risks and incidents, including threats and acts of terrorism, in accordance with current law. I thank both Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for the bipartisan work done to bring the bill before the House for Consideration. I am pleased that during the Committee markup of H.R. 4743, two important Jackson Lee Amendments were adopted. The first Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R. 4743 establishes metrics as a measure of the effectiveness of the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium program. Having the information provided by my amendment to H.R. 4743, will allow the Congressional oversight committees to better plan future programs around cybersecurity collaborations that are intended to share knowledge on best practices in securing computer networks from attack. The second Jackson Lee Amendment added an additional objective of the bill, a directive that should help participants prepare to address continuity of operations. This amendment provides a focus for the Consortium's work on the issue of continuity of operation, which addresses whether an entity can survive a cyber-attack, continue to provide information or services during an attack; or the likelihood that the time to recovery from a successful cyberattack or threat is predictable and reasonable. Just as the attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001 came without notice so may a major cyber-attack. In March, of this year, U.S. Attorney General Lynch announced ``wanted'' notices for a group of Iranian hackers the United States believes are behind a 2013 computer intrusion of a small New York dam and a series of cyberattacks on dozens of U.S. banks. There are many companies offering continuity of operations services to companies large and small with the intent that they will be there to support their clients in the event of a cyber incident. The work of the Consortium should go beyond planning to the answering questions regarding the operationalization of plans in the event of an attack or cyber incident. We know that planning is crucial, but we must encourage cybersecurity planning to go beyond the planning process to understand the capacity of an entity's continuity of operations plans by looking at continuity of operations of service providers should an incident impact an area or industry. I support H.R. 4743, because it provides this assurance by providing critical cybersecurity collaboration among experts and industries that are essential to critical infrastructure operations or have a significant economic presence in our nation's economy that a cyber- attack would have broad repercussions. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4743. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4743, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_176.csv,20970,20970,21035,"[congressional record volume 162, number 77 (monday, may 16, 2016)] [house] [pages h2409-h2411] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] national cybersecurity preparedness consortium act of 2016 mr. ratcliffe. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 4743) to authorize the secretary of homeland security to establish a national cybersecurity preparedness consortium, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 4743 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``national cybersecurity preparedness consortium act of 2016''. sec. 2. national cybersecurity preparedness consortium.

minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas. general leave mr. ratcliffe. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to [[page h2410]] revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from texas? there was no objection. mr. ratcliffe. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 4743. the national cybersecurity preparedness consortium act of 2016 allows the u.s. department of homeland security to work with a consortium, including the national cybersecurity preparedness consortium, to support efforts to address cybersecurity risks and incidents. this bill allows dhs to engage with a consortium to assist the national cybersecurity and communications integration center, or nccic, in providing training to state and local first responders in preparing for and responding to cybersecurity risks and incidents. an example of a consortium dhs may work with under this bill is the national cybersecurity preparedness consortium, or ncpc. the ncpc provides state and local communities with the tools they need to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber attacks. the consortium also evaluates communities' cybersecurity posture and provides them with a roadmap to correct deficiencies in the security of their information systems. based out of the university of texas at san antonio's center for infrastructure assurance and security, the ncpc membership includes the university of arkansas, the university of memphis, norwich university, and texas a&m engineering extension service. dhs is responsible for carrying out significant aspects of the federal government's cybersecurity mission. the cybersecurity act, which was recently signed into law, allows dhs to actively share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures with the private sector by affording liability protections. dhs's national cybersecurity and communications integration center is responsible for facilitating cross-sector coordination to address cybersecurity risks and incidents. h.r. 4743 allows dhs to work with any consortium, including the ncpc, in a number of activities, including providing technical assistance, conducting cross-sector cybersecurity training and simulation exercises, and helping states and local communities to develop cybersecurity information sharing programs. allowing dhs to work with organizations already supporting state and local cyber preparedness and response will provide additional support to state and local entities. i urge all members to join me in supporting this bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h.r. 4743, the national cybersecurity preparedness consortium act of 2016. mr. speaker, h.r. 4743 allows the department of homeland security to utilize university-based consortia to help provide cybersecurity training and support to state, local, and tribal leaders, including first responders. there is strong bipartisan support for this legislation, as introduced by the gentleman from texas (mr. castro). h.r. 4743 authorizes dhs to use consortia to provide state and local governments with university-developed cyber training and technical assistance, including for the development of cyber information sharing that jurisdictions in need can use. recent studies reveal that organizations at the state and local level describe their cybersecurity programs as being in the early and middle stages of maturity, and 86 percent of state and local respondents identified managing cybersecurity risk as one of their most stressful jobs. by partnering with consortia, dhs can make a meaningful impact on raising the levels of cybersecurity on the state, local, and tribal levels. importantly, h.r. 4743 requires dhs, when selecting a consortium for participation in its cyber efforts, to not only take into account the prior experience of the institutions that would be conducting

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from [[Page H2414]] New York (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Since the tragic events of 9/11, this body has endeavored to better integrate intelligence and law enforcement agencies to react to new and evolving threats and to reduce duplicative efforts and waste. To a large extent, we have succeeded in producing a more integrated security apparatus that properly reflects the terrorist threats of the 21st century. However, we must continue to make improvements to counter fast-changing threats like those posed by ISIS. Mr. Speaker, we are seeing the greatest convergence of radical Islamic threats in history, with more than 40,000 jihadist fighters traveling to the battlefield in Syria and Iraq. Furthermore, the United States faces the highest threat level since 9/11--with open counterterrorism investigations in all 50 States in this great country of ours and with more than 80 ISIS-related arrests in the past 2 years, including one just up the road from my district on New Year's Eve. With the current threat environment in mind, I offer H.R. 4407, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board Act of 2016. Initially established at the end of 2010, this panel brings together the Department of Homeland Security's top counterterrorism decisionmakers to respond to threats. However, I led a bipartisan task force, which found that the Counterterrorism Advisory Board, or CTAB, had neither been codified nor had its charter kept pace with today's evolving terrorist threats. That is why we need to pass this bill--to ensure that the DHS is effectively integrating intelligence, operations, and policy to fight terrorism and that it is quickly exchanging threat information. This legislation formally establishes the CTAB in law, and it makes it the Department's central coordination body for counterterrorism activities. The bill also updates the Board's charter to better enable it to confront tomorrow's challenges today, and it requires the Secretary to appoint a Coordinator for Counterterrorism to oversee the Board's activities. It is an important change to the current structure. Additionally, the legislation requires the CTAB to advise the Secretary on the issuance of terrorism alerts, ensuring that top counterterrorism and intelligence officials play a key role in developing these critical notices to the public. Finally, H.R. 4407 ensures continued congressional oversight by requiring the DHS to report on the status and activities of the CTAB so that we can be certain it is meeting its mandate. I thank Chairman McCaul for appointing me to lead the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, which formulated, roughly, 50 recommendations for making our country safer, one of which serves as the basis for this legislation. I also thank Ranking Member Thompson and his great staff for all of the work we have been doing to get a lot of these bills passed into law, and I very much appreciate our bipartisan work together. I am proud to say we have now acted legislatively on more than half of the task force's findings, largely thanks to the hard work of the other members of the task force and their willingness to reach across the aisle and do what is right for our country. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4407, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board Act of 2016. H.R. 4407 authorizes, within the Department of Homeland Security, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board, or CTAB, to coordinate and integrate Departmental intelligence, activities, and policy related to counterterrorism. Since 2010, the internal body, which is comprised of top DHS officials, has helped to harmonize counterterrorism programs and activities across the DHS. H.R. 4407 directs the CTAB to meet on a regular basis to coordinate and integrate the Department's counterterrorism efforts, and it sets forth the leadership and composition of the Board. H.R. 4407 also requires the DHS to report to Congress on the Board's status and activities. This legislation is a product of the House Committee on Homeland Security's bipartisan Task Force on Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, which learned that the CTAB, which has operated for 6 years, was never authorized in law. {time} 1800 To ensure that the board remains an integral part of counterterrorism policy recommendations and responses across the Department, the task force recommended that the board be codified in law. Codification of the board is consistent with the task force's finding that information sharing is critical to preventing foreign fighter travel. I believe that the CTAB should be a permanent fixture in the Department to help inform the counterterrorism decisionmaking of future Department Secretaries. As such, I support this legislation, which tackles an important task force recommendation and finding, and commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) for introducing it as well as making it here for the hearing of this bill today. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Again, H.R. 4407 will authorize within the Department of Homeland Security the counterterrorism advisory board to coordinate and integrate departmental intelligence activities and policies related to counterterrorism. The board already plays a central and necessary role within DHS. Enactment of H.R. 4407 will ensure that, no matter what happens in the upcoming election or who is the head of the Department, the counterterrorism advisory board will remain intact. I urge passage of H.R. 4407. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I once again urge my colleagues to support this strong bipartisan piece of legislation. It is commonsense legislation, but it is very important to institutionalize things that are working to some extent within the Department of Homeland Security and the counterterrorism advisory board. The tweaks that we have in this legislation are going to make it a good, firm setting for fighting the counterterrorism activity going forward. I do want to note for a moment as well that there have been an awful lot of bills that came out of Homeland Security this term, and the vast majority of those bills have had bipartisan support. I am proud of the work we are doing together with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and we are going to continue to do that moving forward to keep this country safe. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4407, Counterterrorism Advisory Board Act of 2016, because it will establish a board to coordinate and integrate DHS's intelligence, activities, and clarify policy related to its counterterrorism mission and functions. As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security since its establishment, and current Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security this bill is of importance to me. It was said of the George W. Bush Administration by the 9-11 Commission that it did not connect the dots that would have allowed the intelligence and law enforcement communities to detect and possibly deter the September 11, 2001 attack against our nation. We have learned a great deal over the nearly 15 years since Al Qaeda attacked our nation. One of the more important lessons is the need to have coordination and unity of effort among and within intelligence and law enforcement agencies in our battle to defeat terrorists. [[Page H2415]] H.R. 4407 establishes a board that will: (1) advise the Secretary of DHS on the issuance of terrorism alerts, and meet on a regular basis to discuss intelligence; and (2) coordinate ongoing threat mitigation efforts and departmental activities. The terrorism alert system initiated following September 2001, caused confusion and uncertainty. In November 2002, I was proud to join my colleagues in voting to create the Department of Homeland Security. H.R. 4407 will develop a process for determining when alerts should be issued, which will make it easier for the Department of Homeland Security to develop messages that will guide public and interagency actions. My work on the Homeland Security Committee has allowed me the privilege of serving as Chair of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, and the Ranking Member of the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee. The Homeland Security Committee has worked over the years since its founding to ensure that this agency is prepared and staffed to meet the challenges and demands of its mandate. As we have worked to define and support the mission of the Department of Homeland Security we have worked to keep the efforts of the agency focused not only on the threats we have faced, but also the new ones that may come. It is the responsibility of Congress not only to provide DHS with new guidelines, but also to provide the agency with the funding it needs to do the work of protecting this great nation. For several Congresses DHS has faced a government shutdown and sequestration that has depleted its resources and stranded its efforts to do all of the work members of this body demands. Mr. Speaker, since DHS initiated its headquarters consolidation in 2006, it has progressed despite changes in senior leadership and waning funding support from Congress. As I urge my colleagues to support this bill, I also remind them that the passage of new laws that require more of the agency should also mean that we should require more of ourselves as members of Congress. We should support the work of the men and women of DHS as they stand on the front line of our nation's domestic security by making sure that they have the tools and the skills needed to do the job we require. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4407. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4407, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2413-H2415] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COUNTERTERRORISM ADVISORY BOARD ACT OF 2016 Mr. KATKO.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Since the tragic events of 9/11, this body has endeavored to better integrate intelligence and law enforcement agencies to react to new and evolving threats and to reduce duplicative efforts and waste. To a large extent, we have succeeded in producing a more integrated security apparatus that properly reflects the terrorist threats of the 21st century. However, we must continue to make improvements to counter fast-changing threats like those posed by ISIS. Mr. Speaker, we are seeing the greatest convergence of radical Islamic threats in history, with more than 40,000 jihadist fighters traveling to the battlefield in Syria and Iraq. Furthermore, the United States faces the highest threat level since 9/11--with open counterterrorism investigations in all 50 States in this great country of ours and with more than 80 ISIS-related arrests in the past 2 years, including one just up the road from my district on New Year's Eve. With the current threat environment in mind, I offer H.R. 4407, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board Act of 2016. Initially established at the end of 2010, this panel brings together the Department of Homeland Security's top counterterrorism decisionmakers to respond to threats. However, I led a bipartisan task force, which found that the Counterterrorism Advisory Board, or CTAB, had neither been codified nor had its charter kept pace with today's evolving terrorist threats. That is why we need to pass this bill--to ensure that the DHS is effectively integrating intelligence, operations, and policy to fight terrorism and that it is quickly exchanging threat information. This legislation formally establishes the CTAB in law, and it makes it the Department's central coordination body for counterterrorism activities. The bill also updates the Board's charter to better enable it to confront tomorrow's challenges today, and it requires the Secretary to appoint a Coordinator for Counterterrorism to oversee the Board's activities. It is an important change to the current structure. Additionally, the legislation requires the CTAB to advise the Secretary on the issuance of terrorism alerts, ensuring that top counterterrorism and intelligence officials play a key role in developing these critical notices to the public. Finally, H.R. 4407 ensures continued congressional oversight by requiring the DHS to report on the status and activities of the CTAB so that we can be certain it is meeting its mandate. I thank Chairman McCaul for appointing me to lead the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, which formulated, roughly, 50 recommendations for making our country safer, one of which serves as the basis for this legislation. I also thank Ranking Member Thompson and his great staff for all of the work we have been doing to get a lot of these bills passed into law, and I very much appreciate our bipartisan work together. I am proud to say we have now acted legislatively on more than half of the task force's findings, largely thanks to the hard work of the other members of the task force and their willingness to reach across the aisle and do what is right for our country. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4407, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board Act of 2016. H.R. 4407 authorizes, within the Department of Homeland Security, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board, or CTAB, to coordinate and integrate Departmental intelligence, activities, and policy related to counterterrorism. Since 2010, the internal body, which is comprised of top DHS officials, has helped to harmonize counterterrorism programs and activities across the DHS. H.R. 4407 directs the CTAB to meet on a regular basis to coordinate and integrate the Department's counterterrorism efforts, and it sets forth the leadership and composition of the Board. H.R. 4407 also requires the DHS to report to Congress on the Board's status and activities. This legislation is a product of the House Committee on Homeland Security's bipartisan Task Force on Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, which learned that the CTAB, which has operated for 6 years, was never authorized in law. {time} 1800 To ensure that the board remains an integral part of counterterrorism policy recommendations and responses across the Department, the task force recommended that the board be codified in law. Codification of the board is consistent with the task force's finding that information sharing is critical to preventing foreign fighter travel. I believe that the CTAB should be a permanent fixture in the Department to help inform the counterterrorism decisionmaking of future Department Secretaries. As such, I support this legislation, which tackles an important task force recommendation and finding, and commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) for introducing it as well as making it here for the hearing of this bill today. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Again, H.R. 4407 will authorize within the Department of Homeland Security the counterterrorism advisory board to coordinate and integrate departmental intelligence activities and policies related to counterterrorism. The board already plays a central and necessary role within DHS. Enactment of H.R. 4407 will ensure that, no matter what happens in the upcoming election or who is the head of the Department, the counterterrorism advisory board will remain intact. I urge passage of H.R. 4407. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I once again urge my colleagues to support this strong bipartisan piece of legislation. It is commonsense legislation, but it is very important to institutionalize things that are working to some extent within the Department of Homeland Security and the counterterrorism advisory board. The tweaks that we have in this legislation are going to make it a good, firm setting for fighting the counterterrorism activity going forward. I do want to note for a moment as well that there have been an awful lot of bills that came out of Homeland Security this term, and the vast majority of those bills have had bipartisan support. I am proud of the work we are doing together with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and we are going to continue to do that moving forward to keep this country safe. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4407, Counterterrorism Advisory Board Act of 2016, because it will establish a board to coordinate and integrate DHS's intelligence, activities, and clarify policy related to its counterterrorism mission and functions. As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security since its establishment, and current Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security this bill is of importance to me. It was said of the George W. Bush Administration by the 9-11 Commission that it did not connect the dots that would have allowed the intelligence and law enforcement communities to detect and possibly deter the September 11, 2001 attack against our nation. We have learned a great deal over the nearly 15 years since Al Qaeda attacked our nation. One of the more important lessons is the need to have coordination and unity of effort among and within intelligence and law enforcement agencies in our battle to defeat terrorists. [[Page H2415]] H.R. 4407 establishes a board that will: (1) advise the Secretary of DHS on the issuance of terrorism alerts, and meet on a regular basis to discuss intelligence; and (2) coordinate ongoing threat mitigation efforts and departmental activities. The terrorism alert system initiated following September 2001, caused confusion and uncertainty. In November 2002, I was proud to join my colleagues in voting to create the Department of Homeland Security. H.R. 4407 will develop a process for determining when alerts should be issued, which will make it easier for the Department of Homeland Security to develop messages that will guide public and interagency actions. My work on the Homeland Security Committee has allowed me the privilege of serving as Chair of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, and the Ranking Member of the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee. The Homeland Security Committee has worked over the years since its founding to ensure that this agency is prepared and staffed to meet the challenges and demands of its mandate. As we have worked to define and support the mission of the Department of Homeland Security we have worked to keep the efforts of the agency focused not only on the threats we have faced, but also the new ones that may come. It is the responsibility of Congress not only to provide DHS with new guidelines, but also to provide the agency with the funding it needs to do the work of protecting this great nation. For several Congresses DHS has faced a government shutdown and sequestration that has depleted its resources and stranded its efforts to do all of the work members of this body demands. Mr. Speaker, since DHS initiated its headquarters consolidation in 2006, it has progressed despite changes in senior leadership and waning funding support from Congress. As I urge my colleagues to support this bill, I also remind them that the passage of new laws that require more of the agency should also mean that we should require more of ourselves as members of Congress. We should support the work of the men and women of DHS as they stand on the front line of our nation's domestic security by making sure that they have the tools and the skills needed to do the job we require. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4407. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4407, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_176.csv,15194,15194,15259,"[congressional record volume 162, number 77 (monday, may 16, 2016)] [house] [pages h2413-h2415] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] counterterrorism advisory board act of 2016 mr. katko. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 4407) to amend the homeland security act of 2002 to establish in the department of homeland security a board to coordinate and integrate departmental intelligence, activities, and policy related to counterterrorism, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 4407 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``counterterrorism advisory board act of 2016''. sec. 2. department of homeland security counterterrorism advisory board.

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security is currently in Cuba participating in bilateral meetings on law enforcement cooperation with the Castro regime. This will serve as another propaganda coup for the Castro brothers. In the past, the Obama administration and Cuba have held technical exchanges on counternarcotics. Yet, last month, Panamanian authorities intercepted over 400 kilos of cocaine in a shipment from--guess where-- Cuba en route to Belgium. This is not the first time that the Castro brothers tried to ship illicit materials. In 2013, Mr. Speaker, approximately 240 tons of illegal weapons were intercepted by Panamanians on a ship going from Cuba to North Korea. In fact, this shipment was the largest weapons cache ever intercepted going to North Korea in violation of several U.N. Security Council resolutions. So how does this happen, Mr. Speaker? Let's not forget that Cuba's military owns and operates Cuba's port facilities. [[Page H2417]] So how does cocaine, how do shipments, and how do guns get onto these ships? I doubt that our deputy secretary will inquire about the complicity of the Castro regime in these illicit shipments when he meets with his Cuban counterparts.

Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, today is a day that is a very emotional day for my family and me. Many years ago, there was a beautiful young woman who grew up in Pacoima. She was the daughter of immigrants, and I was lucky enough to meet her and lucky enough for her to accept a date. Some years later, we got married, 24 years ago today, and I just wanted to take an opportunity to thank her for having a moment of lapse and accepting that date and eventually for us getting married. We have four beautiful children that we have raised. I don't take it for granted, ladies and gentlemen, that as her parents are from Mexico and my parents are from Mexico, from another country, we now have been able to provide a better life for our children that previous generations could not. So I stand before you as a proud American and a very happy man to know that I am married to a wonderful woman, born Norma Sanchez and now is Norma Cardenas. She is the mother of our children and someone that I miss very much. So to you, Norma, I am sorry I couldn't be home. I am thousands of miles away. But thank you for understanding. I look forward to seeing you to celebrate with you soon. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Page H2417] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE CARDENAS' 24TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Every year on May 17, LGBT individuals and their allies use this day to bring awareness to LGBT discrimination. Since 2004, this day has expanded to every corner of the world. It is celebrated in more than 130 countries, including 37 countries where homosexuality is illegal, where courageous individuals and organizations are standing up for basic human rights. Sadly, homophobia, transphobia, and LGBT discrimination still exist around the world. Despite last year's victory for marriage equality, many still want to turn the clock back on equality. North Carolina, Mississippi, and Tennessee's recent anti-LGBT laws cast light on this discrimination. Sadly, these hateful bills are nothing more than State- sanctioned hate. I am proud to have introduced H. Res. 263, supporting the goals and ideals of the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members [[Page H2419]] may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous material relevant to the subject matter of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening as co-anchor along with my classmate and scholar, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, from the Eighth District of New York, for tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, Equal Justice Under the Law: Criminal Justice Reform and Challenging the School-to-Prison Pipeline. Congressman Jeffries leads by example. He is a member of the Criminal Justice Task Force, and he has a long personal and professional history of being a Brother's Keeper. This evening the Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor to discuss the current state of America's criminal justice system and the necessary reform, reform that will allow us to invest in our communities and expand opportunities for all Americans. Mr. Speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is an epidemic that is plaguing schools across the Nation. Mr. Speaker, the need and appetite to reform our Federal criminal justice system has been building for years, and now it is clear that there is consensus that the time is now to take meaningful action. The school-to-prison pipeline refers to the policies and practices that pushes our Nation's children, especially our most at-risk children, out of the classroom and into the juvenile and criminal justice system. Far too often, students are expended, expelled, or even arrested for minor offenses that lead to visits to the principal's office a thing of the past. Statistics reflect that these policies disproportionately target students of color and those with a history of abuse, neglect, poverty, or learning disabilities. Those who are unnecessarily forced out of school become stigmatized and fall behind in their studies, Mr. Speaker. Many eventually decide to drop out of school altogether, and many others commit crimes in their community. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder discussed the issue in a speech to the American Bar Association in 2013, stating that rigid discipline policies transformed too many educational institutions from the doorway of opportunity into the gateway to the criminal justice system and that a minor school disciplinary offense should put a student in the principal's office, not in the police precinct. According to recent data by the Department of Education, African American students are arrested far more than their White classmates. Black and Hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in school-related arrests or referrals to law enforcement. Currently, African Americans make up two-fifths of combined youth today, Mr. Speaker. In my home State of Ohio, the impact of suspensions and expulsions on communities is striking. In Ohio, a history of prior suspensions from school is the number one factor that leads children to dropping out of school. Children who do not finish high school, as we all are aware, are more likely to end up incarcerated or in our juvenile or criminal justice system and are 3.5 times more likely to be arrested. Approximately 82 percent of the adult population is composed of high school dropouts. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this is a pipeline that reflects the prioritization of incarceration over education. But, Mr. Speaker, I come today as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus because I believe we can disrupt the pipeline. To do this, we need to be honest about the opportunity gaps that exist across our country and in our schools because you cannot talk about the school-to-prison pipeline without discussing what needs to be provided as economic opportunities. We need better educational chances for our young people. We need more support to our families so that they can do the best job that they can or that they are capable of doing to help support their own children. We must confront prejudices in our Nation head-on. That is why initiatives like the White House's My Brother's Keeper is so important. My Brother's Keeper Task Force is a coordinated Federal effort to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Mr. Speaker, lastly, this past weekend I met with the dynamic men of the Columbus chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, in my district and saw My Brother's Keeper work firsthand. I learned of their many forms of being role models, as being community mentors for at-risk students, particularly young males, who are in need of inspiration and counsel regarding their choice of a life's career. The mentoring men of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, are men who are doctors, lawyers, government officials, teachers, and entrepreneurs, just to name a few. Mr. Speaker, these men are role models for the community. They bought a house in my district, and they use that home as an anchor to provide opportunities and leadership development, professional networking, and positive reinforcement. Tonight it is important for me to put a face on what we need to do as one small example to stop the school-to-prison pipeline. I salute Philip Shotwell, Polemarch; Richard Crockett, 1st Vice Polemarch; Attorney Byron Potts; Dr. Gus Parker; and Board of Directors Nathaniel Jordan for being men who understand, if we are going to stop the school-to-prison pipeline, we need to look at our own districts. A young man asked them why he should stay in school, and they replied: Young man, you are your own future. We are relying on you to be a law-abiding citizen, educated, self-sufficient, and a good citizen because we don't want you to be a statistic in the school-to-prison pipeline. Mr. Speaker, tonight you will hear many stories, you will hear facts, and you will hear about legislation. Let me end by saying that I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Safe, Accountable, Fair, Effective (SAFE) Justice Reinvestment Act of 2015, H.R. 2944, a bill that recognizes the importance of mentoring and reducing recidivism and helps offenders think through the decisions that confront them when they leave prison. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), our chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, a person who has a long background in being an advocate and a fighter for those who are in our communities and faced with many of the things that you are going to hear tonight. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Beatty for yielding, thank her for her friendship, and thank her for all that she does not just for the Congressional Black Caucus, but for all that she does for the constituents that she represents back in Ohio and for what she does for all people in America. Let me also thank Congressman Jeffries for his great work and his willingness to participate in these Special Order hours. I know that the evening is late sometimes, but the two of them come to the floor and work very hard. I want to spend my few minutes, if I may, Mr. Speaker, talking about just an overview of the criminal justice system. There is no question that the criminal justice system is broken. All of us I think can agree on that. Those on the left and those on the right, all of us even, for different reasons, perhaps, come to one conclusion, that the criminal justice system is in need of serious, serious reform. I know that we are debating legislation here in the House regarding reforming the criminal justice system. Our colleagues over in the Senate are doing the same. But it is time for action. It is time for action on criminal justice reform in the 114th Congress. As many of my colleagues know, I spent 30 years, 30 long years, in a courtroom, half of those as a lawyer, the other half as a judge. Most of the 15 years as a judge I was a trial judge, which meant that I was on the front line in our criminal justice system and I saw it firsthand. I can tell you without question that the criminal justice system in America is in need of serious reform from the top to the bottom. [[Page H2420]] We have all heard the statistics, and I am going to repeat them again tonight: 2.2 million Americans are in prison. Of that number, that number is disproportionately African American. That is 25 percent of the world's prison population right here in the United States of America. Just think about that, Mr. Speaker. We are 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of those who are incarcerated are incarcerated in the United States of America. We have a serious problem of mass incarceration that must be reduced. But the point that I want to put in the Record tonight is that, of those who are incarcerated in this country, 90 percent of those are incarcerated at the State level and 10 percent incarcerated at the Federal level--90 percent incarcerated at the State level. {time} 1930 When we discuss criminal justice reform--and Congressman Bobby Scott is going to be speaking in a few minutes, and he talks about this all of the time, as well as Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee--we must not only talk about reform at the Federal level, but we must find ways to require States to reform their criminal justice systems at the local level. We should encourage States to take a serious look at their systems and to seek ways to reduce mass incarceration at the State level without posing any harm to the communities. Too many of those who are incarcerated at the State level are in prison for drug-related offenses and crimes that don't endanger the community whatsoever. We should encourage States to enact expungement laws. We get telephone calls all the time--and I am sure my colleagues get the same calls as well--from those who are seeking ways to expunge their records so that young men and women who have served in the criminal justice system can get some of those offenses removed from their records, particularly those offenses that deal with petty crimes and misdemeanors and drug-related offenses, because when you have these offenses on your criminal record, it prevents young people from getting the gainful employment that they so richly deserve. We also need to encourage States to look at ways to remove criminal charges from criminal records that did not result in convictions. I think most of my colleagues can relate to that. We know that, so often, police officers at the local level will charge a young offender with multiple offenses at the time of arrest, and some of the offenses are not even deserving of a charge. Sometimes police have a tendency to overcharge at the time of arrest. Then when the case finally goes to court, those 10 or 12 charges are reduced down to one charge or two charges; the defendant pleads guilty; and the case is disposed of while the other 8 or 10 charges that are dismissed continue to be on the young person's criminal record for a lifetime. So often, just the fact that the individual has been charged with a crime prevents that young person from getting a job. So often, it makes a difference. Finally, I thank Mrs. Beatty for talking about using the court system to punish students. That happens. It happens in every State in America. Our public school systems cannot, and should not, use the court system as a means of punishment for students who have behavioral problems in school. I thank all of my colleagues for all of their work. I thank them for their efforts. I thank them for their tremendous interest in this subject because it is real. We know it. We need criminal justice reform, and we need it now. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank Congressman Butterfield. We certainly agree with you that the criminal justice system is broken. That is why the Congressional Black Caucus is here tonight--to make sure that we are prepared to outline the steps and the legislation that is going to be in the forefront. I thank the gentleman for his leadership in making this a top priority for the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentleman from the Third Congressional District of Virginia. He is a true scholar, an attorney, and someone who is a leader on tonight's topic. He is someone who has worked tirelessly to make sure that we do more than just come and stand and talk about this issue tonight. He comes to talk about real reform, to talk about making a difference in our broken criminal justice system. He is my friend, Congressman Bobby Scott. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlewoman. I appreciate the gentleman from New York and certainly the gentlewoman from Ohio for organizing this Special Order to discuss the need for criminal justice reform. Mr. Speaker, we have serious, fundamental problems with our criminal justice system today. For too long, policymakers have chosen to play politics with crime policy by enacting so-called tough on crime slogans and sound bites, such as three strikes and you are out, mandatory minimum sentences, and--if you get it to rhyme, apparently, it is better--if you do the adult crime, you do the adult time. As appealing as these policies sound, their impacts range from a negligible reduction in crime to actually increasing the crime rate. As a result of these policies, the United States, despite representing only 5 percent of the world's population, has 25 percent of the world's prisoners and now has the highest incarceration rate of any nation's, by far, in the world. There are 2.2 million people behind bars in this country. That is triple the number of prisoners we had just three decades ago. At over 700 persons incarcerated for every 100,000 in the population, the United States far exceeds the world's average incarceration rate of about 100 per 100,000. Recent studies have questioned the sanity of this mass incarceration. For example, the Pew Research Center on States estimates that after about 350 per 100,000, any crime reduction value begins to diminish, and at over 500 per 100,000, incarceration becomes, actually, counterproductive. As I said, our rate is now at 700 per 100,000. These counterproductive effects are created because today there are too many children who are being raised by a parent who is in prison and by too many people with felony records who are unable to find jobs. The impact of our tax dollars is also distressing. The Bureau of Prisons is consuming too much of the Department of Justice's budget, meaning that the Department has fewer and fewer resources for other programs that can actually reduce crime and enhance public safety. The tough on crime approach falls the hardest on minorities. While the incarceration rate overall in the United States is approximately 700 per 100,000, for Blacks, the incarceration rate is over 2,200 per 100,000; and in some jurisdictions, they lock up Blacks at the rate of 4,000 per 100,000--a rate 40 times the international average. The war on drugs has exacerbated this problem. Over 2,000 Federal prisoners are now serving life without parole for nonviolent drug crimes, and many more are serving unduly harsh sentences for nonviolent offenses. The racial disparities are staggering. Despite the fact that Whites engage in drug offenses at a rate equal to or often higher than that of African Americans, African Americans are incarcerated on drug charges at a rate 10 times greater than that of Whites. We all agree that there is a problem with mass incarceration. So what is the best way to solve it? When reviewing any legislative package called criminal justice reform, I think there are some key principles that we have to address. First, reform must meaningfully address the problem of mass incarceration by significantly reducing admissions to prison and shortening a prisoner's length of stay. Second, any reform must address the primary driver of the ballooning Federal prison populations, and that is mandatory minimum penalties, especially those for drug and firearm offenses. Third, we must address the disparate impact on race in the Federal criminal justice system that has resulted from the application of many neutrally worded policies and laws. Fourth, reform must address mental health and addiction issues as a public health issue and require intervention and treatment plans to resolve underlying issues that led those to be involved in the criminal justice system rather than implement so-called tough on crime, lock 'em up approaches. Everybody knows that the war on drugs [[Page H2421]] has failed. We need to address drug abuse more as a public health issue and less as a criminal justice issue. Fifth, we must provide comprehensive reentry and rehabilitation services and incentives for completing those programs that are found to actually work, with a particular focus on those with the greatest need. Finally, any legislation must be based on research and evidence, not on poll-tested slogans and sound bites or political negotiations, which are unrelated to research and evidence. How do the current proposals stack up? First, we look at the current bills that have been reported out of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees and notice that they fail to embody any of the principles. In fact, they often take the opposite approach. While these bills reduce the number of admissions and/or length of stay in some limited cases, they also create new mandatory minimums, even new mandatory minimums or mandatory consecutive enhancements. They enhance existing mandatory minimums to apply to people who would not get them under the present law, and they irrationally limit who can benefit from prospective and retroactive relief provisions. It is unknown whether there will be an overall increase or decrease in prison impact at the 10-year point after implementation, if these bills pass, compared to doing nothing. The United States Sentencing Commission has been unable to quantify the impact of the expansions or the limitations on relief. So the fact that we do not have the numbers means that we cannot determine whether these bills will have any meaningful effect on mass incarceration. Though the bills do shorten two supersized mandatory minimums, they do not eliminate any mandatory minimum. The Senate bill actually creates two new ones, and both bills create new mandatory consecutive sentencing enhancements, which must be served after any other sentence. Both bills expand mandatory minimums for drug and gun offenses by applying them to people who would not be eligible to receive them today. If the problem we are trying to address is mass incarceration, why are those in the bill to begin with? Neither of the bills will do anything to address the disparate racial impact that pervades our criminal justice system. Federal mandatory minimums, in particular those for drug and firearm offenses, have been studied and have been found to have a racially disparate impact. These bills do nothing to eliminate mandatory minimums. Even though they reduce some, they create new ones, expand others, and create new sentencing enhancements. So the bills may actually make racial disparities in sentencing even worse than they are under present law. Finally, both bills put limits on who can receive prospective and retroactive relief. If you look at the limitations, you will find that they have a racially disparate impact on minorities. On the issue of the war on drugs, both bills also fail to treat drug abuse and addiction as a public health problem. In fact, the strategy used in the bills to address heroin addiction is not a public health approach, for the bills impose mandatory additional prison time. This is not a public health, research-based approach. On the comprehensive reentry and rehabilitation services to reduce recidivism, these bills have turned science and empirical evidence upside down. They give the greatest incentives for completing the programs to those with the lowest need while categorically barring offenders with the highest risk from benefiting from the rehabilitation programs. This approach not only violates research, but it will exacerbate the current racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Mr. Speaker, there is ample research available to show what credible criminal justice reform ought to look like. For example, Texas--one of the Nation's most conservative States--recently passed criminal justice reform legislation that was based on research and evidence, and the result was a significant reduction in crime, a significant reduction in incarceration, and a savings of billions of dollars. The SAFE Justice Act--the Safe, Accountable, Fair, and Effective Justice Act--which I cosponsored with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), which the gentlewoman from Ohio pointed out that she is supporting, was based on the Texas model and includes evidence-based prevention and early intervention programs; reducing incarceration even at the State level as well as at the Federal level; comprehensive police training and funding for body cameras, drug and veterans' courts; a significant reduction in the use of mandatory minimum sentences; and rehabilitation for all of those in prison and second- chance programs for those who have been released. It has broad, bipartisan support. All of the provisions in the bill are fully paid for by reallocating the reduction in mandatory minimums, and it shows that we do not have to accept a bill that fails to conform to evidence and research. Mr. Speaker, criminal justice reform legislation ought to be consistent with the research and evidence that is readily available. From what I can tell, the bills reported out of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have nothing based in research and evidence and, sadly, seem more concerned about the politics of criminal justice reform, with little regard to actually wanting to end our Nation's addiction to mass incarceration. The SAFE Justice Act is a better evidence-based approach, which will, if enacted, reduce crime, save money, and reduce racial disparities that pervade our criminal justice system. I appreciate the gentlewoman from Ohio and the gentleman from New York for hosting tonight's Special Order. {time} 1945 Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Scott for clearly articulating to us why we cannot let our criminal justice system remain on this trajectory. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the Congresswoman from the 13th District of California. My colleague and my friend is someone who travels the world advocating for those who live in poverty, advocating for those who are incarcerated in this broken criminal justice system that we are focusing on tonight. I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I first thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for those very kind and humbling remarks. I want to thank her for her tremendous leadership and for continuing to come down here each and every week to ensure that her voice, the Congressional Black Caucus' voice, and Congressman Jeffries' voice are really put forth so that the people of our country will understand the critical issues before us and the fact that the Congressional Black Caucus is really leading on each and every issue. Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman Jeffries really have done a phenomenal job. They both have gone way beyond the call of duty, and so we thank them so much for their efforts. Make no mistake--and I think we are hearing this over and over again tonight--mass incarceration is a crisis in our country. The United States of America imprisons far more people than any other nation in the world. When African Americans are incarcerated at six times the rate of Whites, it is no surprise to me. It is no surprise that African Americans constitute nearly half of the total 2.3 million incarcerated Americans in 2008. Together, African Americans and Latinos comprise 58 percent of all prisoners in 2008, even though African Americans and Latinos make up approximately one-quarter of the United States population. While our prison population grows unchecked and is growing unchecked, we continue to criminalize our students rather than invest in their education. Right now we spend $10,500 a year to educate a child, but we spend $88,000 a year to keep a child locked up. That is unacceptable. Let me repeat that. It costs eight times more money to keep a child in jail than to educate them and prepare them for a good future. We are not just talking about a few children here. Our country incarcerates five times more children than any other nation in the world. Sadly, two-thirds of these kids will never return to school. When we lock up these children, we are essentially throwing away [[Page H2422]] the key. Instead of preparing them for a future, we are just getting them ready for a life in a cell. Now, let me be clear, from the moment many of these children are born, they are funneled into the prison pipeline. Simply put, the system is really stacked against them. For instance, one in three African American children lives in poverty today, while one in four Hispanic children lives in poverty. Mr. Speaker, while Black children represent just 18 percent of preschool enrollment, they account for nearly half of all preschool suspensions. Now, Congresswoman Beatty, we are talking toddlers ages 2 to 5. These kids don't even get a start, let alone a head start. They are being suspended from school. How do you suspend toddlers and babies from school? Something is wrong with this. So we, I must say, in the Appropriations Committee are trying to address this with the Department of Education. This is immoral. When they get older, African American students are four times more likely to be expelled from school than their White peers for the same offense. More than half of all students who are involved in school- related arrests or referred to law enforcement are Black or Latino. This has a lasting effect and impact on young students. Studies show that students who are disciplined by schools are more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system where their chances of returning to school are slim to none. This is unacceptable. These young people are having their futures ripped away before they even have a chance. We need to change the system and end the school-to-prison pipeline. First, we must start by making serious investments in our young people. We should ensure that all students have equal access to high-quality public school education. We must also expand summer youth job opportunities and summer training programs so that our teens have the opportunity to learn workforce skills, contribute to their communities, and start a path to economic opportunity. As a member of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, we are working to try to make sure that these resources become a priority of our subcommittee, which they, unfortunately, aren't at this point. We also need to tear down the institutional racism, quite frankly, that is holding students of color back and trapping our young people in a broken criminal justice system. I am reminded of when I was in the California legislature. I was on the public safety committee, and proposals were brought to us, plans for building prisons 10 to 12 years out for kids who are just starting kindergarten. That is what we had to deal with. Now we see what has happened to the prison industrial complex in California. That is why we must work together and pass legislation to end mass incarceration and fix our broken criminal justice system. We need to get rid of these outdated minimum sentencing standards. These are relics from the failed war on drugs and disproportionately target people of color. In California, once again, the three strikes law passed. Of course, I opposed that while in the California legislature. This law has incarcerated young African American men for nonviolent drug offenses 25 years to life. That is 25 years to life for nonviolent drug offenses. We need to repeal that law. We also need to make sure that law enforcement officers reflect the diversity of communities that they police. So we have introduced H. Res. 262, which supports effective community-oriented policing and encourages greater diversity in law enforcement. During the last appropriation season, the Congressional Black Caucus worked with Congressman Lacy Clay to direct the Department of Justice to begin collecting training data. Our legislation tracks when officers receive training for use of force, racial and ethnic bias, de- escalation of conflict, and constructive engagement with the public. This was just a small step, and we need to do more. With regard to reentry, banning the box is essential. We have worked with the White House to try to make sure that Federal contractors ban the box. We haven't accomplished that, but Federal agencies cannot now ask for one's criminal history records. In my district, we do expungement, we do record remedies. We have remedied thousands and thousands of young people who now can go on and move forward with their lives. I want to thank the Family Law Center in Oakland, California, for doing that. We need to go back to the drawing board and repeal the welfare reform provisions that are denied for life. There is a Federal ban for food stamps, eligibility for public housing, and Pell grants for those who have been incarcerated for drug felonies. Now, you know who that targets; primarily African American and Latino men. They don't even have a second chance when they get out of jail as a result of these lifetime bans. Finally, let me just say it is time to really look at this problem in a big way and to understand that we have to dismantle, not reform--but we have to dismantle this prison industrial complex and start investing in our communities, especially our young children. And we must understand that, in doing this, we have to look at institutional and systemic racism, which is at the core of many of our policies. So this is a fight that we are going to win, but it is going to be because all of us here in the Congressional Black Caucus--Congresswoman Beatty, Congressman Jeffries, Congressman Scott, and Congresswoman Jackson Lee, and the entire membership--continue to fight the good fight to make sure that finally we will begin to see a real criminal justice system, which it is not right now. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lee. When people ask us why are we doing this today, I thank the gentlewoman for reminding us that the system is stacked against us and that we have had the future of so many of our young folks ripped away from them. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of Ohio (Ms. Fudge). She is from the 11th Congressional District. She is an attorney. She has served as a former mayor. She is the immediate past chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. She is someone who gives us advice. I remember her saying to us: Push the envelope because you are the voice for the voiceless. Look at the legislative issues that will make a difference in the lives of others. So tonight we come to talk about equal justice under the law. Mr. Speaker, we come to challenge this House. It is my great honor to yield to Congresswoman Marcia Fudge. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. It is a pleasure to watch my fellow Ohioan and friend and the gentleman from New York on this House floor every Monday night bringing the message of the Congressional Black Caucus because indeed they are the people who carry our message to the United States. Mr. Speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is robbing far too many children of productive futures. Instead of learning in classrooms, a large percentage of our Nation's at-risk students sit in jail cells. The numbers don't lie. Black students are suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater than White students. More than one in four boys of color with disabilities and nearly one in five girls of color with disabilities receives an out-of-school suspension. And studies show that students who are suspended or expelled in school are more likely to end up in prison. Our Nation's children deserve better. It is time we prioritize education and not incarceration. Comprehensive criminal justice reform must include policies which dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline. We must reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, a bill that funds delinquency prevention and improvements in State and local juvenile justice programs, supports restorative initiatives, and promotes early intervention. Disrupting the pipeline will provide a pathway for a successful future and lessen the burden on our current judicial system. The number of people incarcerated in America quadrupled between 1980 and 2008. Of the more than 2.3 million Americans incarcerated today, more than 1 million of them are Black. In my home State of Ohio, more than 50,000 people are incarcerated in a system that was designed to only hold [[Page H2423]] 39,000. And on average, States across this Nation spend $30,000 per year to house one inmate. That is at least $19,000 more per year than we spend to educate one child. It is time we get our priorities straight. As ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, promoting policies that keep our children in school is one of my top priorities. I ask my colleagues: What are yours? Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Fudge for reminding us again of the value and the importance of our work. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is indeed my honor to yield time to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), who is coanchor of tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. As I said earlier, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries is not only a scholar, he, too, is an attorney. He is someone who walks the talk. He is someone who has a long history of being a Brother's Keeper. Mr. Speaker, so tonight, when we discuss this topic, when we talked about the challenge, when we talked about all of the plethora of things that are incorporated in why we must come forward tonight to challenge the criminal justice system which is stacked against us and broken, certainly we have heard the disparities as it relates to African Americans. So it is indeed my honor to ask my coanchor, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, to share with us our challenge. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio, my good friend, the distinguished and dynamic anchor for tonight's Special Order, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, for yielding and for her continued leadership and for leading the discussion on the House floor today as it relates the urgency of this Congress and America dealing with the school-to-prison pipeline mass incarceration and the prison industrial complex that so many of my colleagues have explained and exposed here on the House floor today. A few years ago I had a conversation that has always stuck with me in the area of criminal justice when I was speaking to a formally incarcerated individual who spent several years behind bars incarcerated in a New York State penitentiary. He has turned his life around and he is now an advocate for criminal justice reform. He said to me on his final day, after being imprisoned for years in upstate New York, that he had a conversation with a high-ranking corrections officer, a supervisor who he had gotten to know and thought he had befriended to some degree during his time of incarceration. {time} 2000 On that last day, he said to this young African American incarcerated individual who was on his way out, he said: I just want to thank you. This gentleman was a little perplexed. He wasn't sure what he was talking about. He said: I just want to thank you for helping me to get my boat; and beyond that, I want to thank your son, who is going to help my son get his boat as well. That conversation has really haunted me because, in such a powerful and profound way, what it captures is the essence of what the prison industrial complex represents, which is this decision that was made in so many parts of the United States of America, certainly in New York, by Democrats and Republicans. When the automobile factories and the steel mills, the manufacturing plants began to close in the 1970s and in the 1980s, devastating parts of the upstate economy, a decision was made in place of those factory jobs to build prisons in their place as a means of economic development for depressed upstate communities. But here is the problem. If you build it, someone has got to fill those prisons. In order to fill those prisons, several things have developed which we are in the process of trying to dismantle right now: the school-to-prison pipeline and the criminalization of young people, particularly in communities of color, where they basically are not given a chance from the very beginning. As a result of being channeled unjustly, often, into the criminal justice system at an early age, they essentially become economic commodities for those who have come to rely on prisons to replace the factory and manufacturing jobs that have left the United States of America. That has been a big problem in New York. It is a problem in other parts of the country. It is a shame here in the United States of America that we have gone from a place where, when the war on drugs began in 1971--President Nixon declared drug abuse public enemy number one--there were less than 350,000 people incarcerated in America. Even when the crime bill that is being heavily debated in the public domain right now was passed in 1994, at the height of the concern about crime here in the United States of America, the incarcerated population was still under 900,000 people. But we have gone from less than 350,000 in 1971 to under 900,000 in 1994 to more than 2.2 million in 2016. The United States has 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's incarcerated individuals. We incarcerate more people than any other country in the world, and it is shameful. The school-to-prison pipeline is a large part of that dynamic, along with the failed war on drugs. So we are going to have to deal with this situation in a meaningful way. The statistics clearly show that, if you suspend a young person, that individual--often a Black or Latino boy--is less likely to graduate and complete school and more likely to become entangled in the criminal justice system because we have applied an overly punitive approach to discipline, particularly in the inner city. Now, in this Chamber, I have seen surprising levels of compassion as it relates to dealing with the heroin and opioid crisis that is sweeping across America right now, and I am glad that folks have decided to take a different approach than the approach that was taken in the 1980s with the crack cocaine epidemic that was sweeping across communities that those of us in the Congressional Black Caucus represent. I welcome this newfound compassion. I just hope that you would extend it now not just to the manner in which we deal with the heroin crisis-- that is important--but let's extend it to the overcriminalization that is taking place as relates to young people across America, particularly in Black and Brown communities. I am glad that we have become enlightened as it relates to moving away from punishment and toward prevention and intervention related to the heroin and opioid crisis. Let's also become enlightened in terms of dealing with breaking the school-to-prison pipeline. We will have more to say as we move forward with this discussion, but I know there are other Members who would like to contribute to this hour of power that Representative Joyce Beatty has brought to the House floor in connection with the CBC Special Order. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jeffries for reminding us that the United States makes up less than 5 percent of the world's population, yet incarcerates nearly a quarter of the global prison population. Thank you for also being on point and reminding us, Mr. Speaker, if we are to reform America's criminal justice system and advance efforts to break the cycles of incarceration in African American communities, in low-income communities, then we must unite and make sure that we pass real legislation. Mr. Speaker, can you advise me how much time we have left, please. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Ohio has 12 minutes remaining. Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is indeed my honor to yield to the gentlewoman who hails from the 18th Congressional District of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Of the many things that this Congresswoman does, she serves on the Committee on the Judiciary, she has been a longtime advocate for reforming the criminal justice system. I refer to her as a strong voice, a strong advocate, and, truly, a scholar. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to add my appreciation to the gentlewoman from Ohio; the gentleman from New York; and the Members who [[Page H2424]] have spoken, including the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Butterfield; the former chair, Ms. Fudge; and the ranking member on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, Mr. Scott. There could not be a more important topic than the topic that we are speaking about tonight. There are moments in history that I think come at times when urgency is the call of the day. It is often said that Dr. King emphasized in his tenure the urgency of moving forward on civil rights and spoke eloquently about the fact of why we cannot wait. If I might, I want to capture his theme of why we cannot wait to end the school-to-prison pipeline. End it now and begin the whole comprehensive approach of criminal justice reform. Let me take Texas as an example and cite some very important statistics from the Appleseed Report and as well a comment on the work that we are doing in the Committee on the Judiciary. I am so glad at this moment in history to be the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations and working with the members of my subcommittee, including Mr. Jeffries, who is a member, Ms. Bass, who is a member, and a number of other members as well, on this very difficult hurdle that we have. Let it be very clear that this hurdle of criminal justice reform is, as I heard Mr. Jeffries make mention of, that we have taken hold of this issue of opioids and heroin in a way that not one single bill was passed last week that had a criminal focus, particularly out of the Committee on the Judiciary. Not one bill had mandatory minimums. In the debate last week, on Friday, I reiterated over and over again no mandatory minimums in this legislation. That should be the perfect that we try to achieve going forward on criminal justice reform. But let me give the beginnings of that very tragic outcome in America, filling up the Nation's prisons, not having criminal justice but criminal unfairness. It starts with a path to incarceration, which includes in the schools, stops, failing public schools, zero tolerance and other school discipline, police in school hallways, disciplinary alternative schools, and court involvement in juvenile detention. All of these are a path for students to incarceration, and it is without understanding what a class C misdemeanor ticket and a trip to court for thousands of Texas students and their families means. Texas students as young as 6 have been ticketed at school in past years, and it is not uncommon for elementary school students to be ticketed by school-based law enforcement. School-based arrest of students often occurs without prior notice to parents. Police officers in some Texas schools are resorting to use of force, measures more commonly associated with fighting street crime: pepper spray, tasers, and trained canines when a schoolyard fight breaks out or when students are misbehaving in a cafeteria or at a school event. This should not be the picture for a 6-year-old or a 4-year-old or an 8-year-old or an 11-year-old or a 13-year-old. This should not be equated with school. Let me read to you part of the Appleseed Report and a quote by Ryan Kellus Turner and Mark Goodner: ``In a little over two decades, a paradigm shift has occurred in the Lone Star State. The misdeeds of children--acts that in the near recent past resulted in trips to the principal's office, corporal punishment, or extra laps under the supervision of a middle school or high school coach . . . '' Now, of course, corporal punishment will be eliminated from that. What is worse, `` . . . now result in criminal prosecution, criminal records, and untold millions of dollars in punitive fines and hefty court costs being imposed against children ages 10 through 16.'' ``It is conservatively estimated that more than 275,000 non-traffic tickets are issued to juveniles in Texas each year . . . '' And based on the information from the Texas Office of Court Administration, the number of non-traffic tickets issued to students may well grossly exceed that number because it was very difficult to get it. ``Texas can interrupt this destructive cycle and prevent the loss of more young people to the `school-to-prison pipeline' through early interventions focused less on punishment and more on creating positive school environments that address students' academic and behavioral needs.'' Let me just say that ``police officers in some Texas schools are resorting to `use of force.' '' Now, they are supposed to be there as SROs. SROs are supposed to have educational training. SROs are supposed to be able to have the understanding of how to deal with counseling issues and teaching that is evidence based, but here is the problem. The problem is that they are focused more on law enforcement. I am glad to be part of this Special Order tonight that deals with the pipeline that has started working our children toward incarceration: overcrowded schools, lack of qualified teachers, inadequate resources, and then the zero tolerance for school discipline of children and the rate of suspension having increased dramatically in recent years from 1.7 million in 1974 to 3.1 million in 2000; and it has gone beyond that, and the greatest emphasis has been on children of color. So here is my call to the United States Congress. We have to begin the process of dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline. We have to understand that children can learn. No child is a throwaway. I offer that often in my remarks in my district. The detention system is an unfair system. I don't know how many of you realize that when a child is sent to juvie, that child can remain there until they reach the age of 21. How does that happen? Even if their sentence is not as egregious as one might think--a simple misbehavior in school. The way that happens is because in juvenile, you can assess more time on a child without telling that child's parent because that child did not follow orders or, in essence, that child did not behave or that child chewed gum when you told them not to. {time} 2015 We in the Judiciary Committee are working on juvenile justice reform. One of them that I am most concerned about and want to move is ending solitary confinement for juveniles, recognizing Kalief's Law, involving the death of one inside the New York prison at Rikers Island. The individual in solitary confinement had not been rendered guilty yet. And so we want to eliminate putting juveniles in solitary confinement. Because the tragedy, Mr. Speaker, was that that youngster was released, ultimately, but after he was released, he, in essence, committed suicide. So I want to close my remarks by indicating that I want to turn this system upside down. I want to make sure that we deal with juvenile justice reform. I want to ban the box. We have done that in legislation that has not yet passed. I want to make sure that we have alternative sentencing. At the same time, the Judiciary Committee has moved two bills out of committee. I want to see these bills have a vigorous discussion and debate on the floor of the House so that we can move to conference. Time is going by. Let us not let the perfect be, in essence, the downfall of change. H.R. 3713 provides for the reduction of sentencing for many who are languishing, by law, in prison today in the Federal system. As I have spoken to people across the country, they have indicated that, even though some States like my State of Texas have made enormous, enormous strides--I am proud of that--it has not happened around the country. The bully pulpit of the Federal Government can be the most effective tool to moving toward criminal justice reform and sentencing reduction dealing with felony drug offenses. We are moving toward that point. A vote on the floor of the House and moving toward conference can move our efforts toward legislation that can truly be responsive to both concerns and as well positives that are in that bill. So as we deal with this prison pipeline, we have to not only talk, we have to do. And when we do, we have to make sure that we respond to the concerns, but we also have to make sure that we move legislation that can ultimately come out of the Senate and go to conference and make a difference in the lives of so many. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio. I also want to say how [[Page H2425]] timely the Congressional Black Caucus is. All that have been crying out, from Black Lives Matter to the Mother of the Movement, say that we need changes dealing with the whole vastness of criminal justice reform: police-community relations, police actions, actions dealing with guns, actions dealing with the loss of life of our young people. Let's get a framework that can allow us to debate, to fix, to amend, and to get a product that will ultimately be signed by the President of the United States on behalf of the people of the United States who are crying out for relief. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) who are anchoring this Special Order on Ending the School-to-Prison Pipeline. The over-criminalization of school children in America can no longer be swept under the rug, ignored or irrationally justified. We are in a state of national crisis and it is time to act. Upon taking office, every Member of Congress makes a solemn pledge: to protect and defend the American people. This is the most important oath we take as elected officials--and, to honor this promise, we must do everything in our power to stem the School-to-Prison Pipeline in our nation. The three most important concerns for Members of Congress today are No. 1 Children, No. 2 Children, and No. 3 Children. House Republicans are still unwilling to act to stop the criminalization of our children in schools and instead work towards providing children the opportunity to thrive in American communities. This Congress has a moral obligation to do our part to end the epidemic of losing our children to the correctional system. Now is the time for Republicans to join Democrats in protecting the lives of America's youth by taking common sense steps in redirecting those who go astray. Over the past year, several proposals have been introduced to address the need for overarching reform of our nation's criminal justice system. Americans must consider the educational environment in which we place our students, from preschool to high school, subjecting them to disciplinary policies that more closely resemble policing than teaching. Around the country, advocates are collecting data illustrating the devastating effects of what they call the ``school-to-prison pipeline,'' where student behavior is criminalized, children are treated like prisoners and, all too often, actually end up behind bars. The school-to-prison pipeline refers to interlocking sets of relationships at the institutional/structural and the individual levels. All of these policies and practices work together to push our nation's schoolchildren--youth of color, especially, our most at-risk children--out of schools and into unemployment and into the juvenile and criminal justice legal systems. This pipeline reflects the prioritization of incarceration over education. For a growing number of students, the path to incarceration includes the ``stops'' deterring matriculation such as: 1) Failing Public Schools; 2) Zero-Tolerance and Other School Discipline; 3) Policing School Hallways; 4) Disciplinary Alternative Schools; and 5) Court Involvement and Juvenile Detention. In a little over two decades, a paradigm shift has occurred in the Lone Star State. The misdeeds of children--acts that in the near recent past resulted in trips to the principal's office, corporal punishment, or extra laps under the supervision of a middle school or high school coach, now result in criminal prosecution, criminal records, and untold millions of dollars in punitive fines and hefty court costs being imposed against children in elementary and high schools. Disrupting class, using profanity, misbehaving on a school bus, student fights, and truancy once meant a trip to the principal's office. Today, such misbehavior results in a Class C misdemeanor ticket and a trip to court for thousands of Texas students and their families each year. It is conservatively estimated that more than 275,000 non-traffic tickets are issued to juveniles in Texas each year. While it is impossible to pinpoint how many of these tickets are issued by campus police, the vast majority of these tickets are issued for offenses most commonly linked to school-related misbehavior-- disruption of class, disorderly conduct, disruption of transportation, truancy, and simple assaults related to student fights. ``Criminalization'' of student misbehavior extends to even the youngest students. In Texas, students as young as six have been ticketed at school in the past five years, and it is not uncommon for elementary-school students to be ticketed by school-based law enforcement. School-based arrest of students often occurs without prior notice to parents or a lawyer being present during initial questioning of the student. The increase in ticketing and arrest of students, in Texas and nationwide, has coincided with the growth in school-based policing. Campus policing is the largest and fastest growing area of law enforcement in Texas, according to its own professional association. With counselors stretched to handle class scheduling and test administration duties, school administrators and teachers are increasingly turning to campus police officers to handle student behavior problems. Today in Texas, most public schools have a police officer assigned to patrol hallways, lunchrooms, school grounds, and after-school events. Police officers in some Texas schools are resorting to ``use of force'' measures more commonly associated with fighting street crime-- pepper spray, Tasers and trained canines--when a schoolyard fight breaks out or when students are misbehaving in a cafeteria or at a school event. The intent is to keep schools and students safe, but there can be unintended consequences to disciplining public school students in a way that introduces them to the justice system or exposes them to policing techniques more commonly used with adults. Texas can interrupt this destructive cycle and prevent the loss of more young people to the ``school-to-prison pipeline'' through early interventions focused less on punishment and more on creating positive school environments that address students' academic and behavioral needs. We must seek appropriate recommendations for reform. For most students, the pipeline begins with inadequate resources in public schools. Overcrowded classrooms, a lack of qualified teachers, and insufficient funding for ``extras'' such as counselors, special education services, and even textbooks, lock students into second-rate educational environments. This failure to meet educational needs increases disengagement and dropouts, increasing the risk of later court involvement. Even worse, schools may actually encourage dropouts in response to pressures from test-based accountability regimes such as the No Child Left Behind Act, which create incentives to push out low-performing students to boost overall test scores. Lacking resources, facing incentives to push out low-performing students, and responding to a handful of highly-publicized school shootings, schools have embraced zero-tolerance policies that automatically impose severe punishment regardless of circumstances. Under these policies, students have been expelled for bringing nail clippers or scissors to school. Rates of suspension have increased dramatically in recent years--from 1.7 million in 1974 to 3.1 million in 2000--and have been most dramatic for children of color. Overly harsh disciplinary policies push students down the pipeline and into the juvenile justice system. Suspended and expelled children are often left unsupervised and without constructive activities. They also can easily fall behind in their coursework, leading to a greater likelihood of disengagement and drop-outs. All of these factors increase the likelihood of court involvement. As harsh penalties for minor misbehavior become more pervasive, schools increasingly ignore or bypass due process protections for suspensions and expulsions. The lack of due process is particularly acute for students with special needs, who are disproportionately represented in the pipeline despite the heightened protections afforded to them under law. Many under-resourced schools become ``pipeline gateways'' by placing increased reliance on police rather than teachers and administrators to maintain discipline. Growing numbers of districts employ school resource officers to patrol school hallways, often with little or no training in working with youth. As a result, children are far more likely to be subject to school- based arrests--the majority of which are for non-violent offenses, such as disruptive behavior--than they were a generation ago. The rise in school-based arrests, the quickest route from the classroom to the jailhouse, most directly exemplifies the criminalization of school children. In some jurisdictions, students who have been suspended or expelled have been completely denied their right to an education. In others, they are sent to disciplinary alternative schools. [[Page H2426]] Growing in number across the country, these shadow systems--sometimes run by private, for-profit companies--are immune from educational accountability standards (such as minimum classroom hours and curriculum requirements) and may fail to provide meaningful educational services to the students who need them the most. As a result, struggling students return to their regular schools unprepared, are permanently locked into inferior educational settings, or are funneled through alternative schools into the juvenile justice system. Youth who become involved in the juvenile justice system are often denied procedural protections in the courts. Studies demonstrate that as many as 80 percent of court-involved children do not have lawyers. Students who commit minor offenses may end up in secured detention if they violate boilerplate probation conditions prohibiting them from activities like missing school or disobeying teachers. Students pushed along the pipeline find themselves in juvenile detention facilities, many of which provide few, if any, educational services. Students of color, who are far more likely than their white peers to be suspended, expelled, or arrested for the same kind of conduct at school, and those with disabilities are particularly likely to travel down this pipeline. Though many students are propelled down the pipeline from school to jail, it is difficult for them to make the journey in reverse. Students who enter the juvenile justice system face many barriers to their re-entry into traditional schools. The vast majority of these students never graduate from high school. Numerous studies have also shown that as many as 70-80 percent of youth involved in the justice system meet the criteria for a disability. We must move away from the engrained culture of criminalization as the answer to our problems. It is no secret that 1 in every 3 black males born today can expect to go to prison at some point in their life, compared with 1 in every 6 Latino males, and 1 in every 17 white males. It is a statistic we know well because it is one that has been reported since 2001 and has remained unchanged for nearly 15 years. It is time we stop repeating and start understanding and unraveling the fateful 1 in 3 trend that continues to sweep entire generations of young men of color into a lifetime of systematic and barriers. The United States currently has the largest number of prisoners in the world due to its skyrocketing national imprisonment rate. Rather than investing in premier educational responses, the United States pays the highest cost globally for incarceration. Federal, state, and local leaders are looking for innovative ways to improve public health and public safety outcomes, while reducing the costs of criminal justice and corrections. A number of innovative strategies can save public funds and improve public health by keeping low-risk, non-violent, drug-involved offenders out of prison or jail, while still holding them accountable and ensuring the safety of our communities. The Obama Administration is committed to funding and evaluating the long-term effects of these innovative criminal justice and corrections interventions. I too call upon my colleagues to come together and pass legislation that will help stop the derailment of children's lives. Meanwhile, Federal agencies will continue to seek opportunities to expand smart probation and problem-solving court initiatives around the country in collaboration with state, local, and tribal agencies. In recognition of the considerable potential in cost savings, improved outcomes for offenders, and improved public safety, a growing number of state and local officials around the country are starting their own promising initiatives to break the cycle of drug use, crime, and incarceration. Nearly every state is struggling with significant shortfalls in revenue and making significant cuts to spending in order to close budget gaps. In making these cuts, many states are focusing attention on corrections spending, one of the fastest growing lines in state budgets over the past two decades. Many states are pursuing a justice reinvestment approach, using data to determine what has been driving the growth in the prison population and how that growth might be stopped. In addition, small investments have been made in programs designed to reduce recidivism. New policies have been enacted, slowing the growth of prison populations or even downsizing corrections systems, saving states hundreds of millions of dollars. A portion of those savings are being reinvested in community-based services and supports, including substance abuse treatment. However, to have meaningful impact on behaviors that contribute to crime, recidivism, and substance abuse, states must focus on a handful of proven strategies that will maximize the impact of limited investments being made in the treatment of substance use disorders and community supervision. I am a strong supporter of education and I am particularly sensitive and protective of measures to keep students safe in school. In this same spirit, we must invest in a multi-step, collaborative process that involves the combined efforts of law enforcement, prosecutors, influential community members, social services, reentry services, community corrections, faith-based organizations, and city management. We have seen too often the horrific abuses of school officers dragging, punching, slapping, and more to students. First and foremost school-based law enforcement personnel need to be removed from the educational setting. And if law enforcement are not removed, they should be required to receive post-certification training in issues specific to youth, including: 1) de-escalation and mediation techniques; 2) restraint techniques to be used when force cannot be avoided; 3) signs and symptoms of trauma, abuse and neglect in children and youth, as well as appropriate responses; 4) signs and symptoms of mental illness in children and youth, and appropriate responses; and 5) manifestations of other disabilities, such as autism, and appropriate responses, adolescent development, Juvenile law, and Special education and applicable general education law. Prohibit school districts from receiving any revenue from Class C ticketing for truancy or any other offense. Eliminate Disruption of Class and Disruption of Transportation as penal code offenses. Prohibit ticketing of students under the age of 14. Young children are simply not equipped to understand a Class C misdemeanor ticket as a meaningful consequence of misbehavior, and the consequences of court involvement on academic success are too great to allow this practice to continue. Ticketing of older students should be a last resort. Ticketing, arrest and use of force in schools is preposterously reshaping today's school disciplinary policies disproportionately to actual need. We must acknowledge this epidemic and move to correct the inevitable injustice that follows when our children are derailed from their futures. I thank my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) for hosting this Special Order on Ending the School-to-Prison Pipeline. It is an invaluable and much needed effort. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, let me just end by saying that the urgency is now. In the words of Nelson Mandela, ``It always seems impossible until it's done.'' Tonight the Congressional Black Caucus says: Let's get it done. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, our children represent the future of our nation. Our future is more promising when our children have a clear path to succeed and have the opportunities to become active members of the community. Over time, a culture of favoring incarceration over education has become more prominent throughout our society--particularly as it relates to minority and low- income populations. Financial shortfalls at all levels of government are also placing downward pressure on states and municipalities to cut back on public services and educational or community-based programs in favor of harsh criminalization or incarceration. The result is the ``school-to-prison pipeline,'' which poses a very real threat to our children and our society. This pipeline refers to harsh policies and practices that cultivate a culture where young individuals are pushed into the juvenile and criminal justice systems through harsh punishments in schools. Inadequate resources in public schools, economic instability, zero-tolerance policies, and harsh punishments for non-violent offenses are all contributing to the school-to-prison pipeline. As a result, the United States suffers from the largest number of prisoners in the world and the economic and social burden of the high costs of incarceration. Zero tolerance policies are dangerous to have in our schools. These policies impose extremely severe punishments on students, regardless of the circumstances, which can result in suspension or even expulsion from school. Children of color and students with special needs have experienced a dramatic increase in these suspensions and expulsions, which greatly increase their probability of entering into the juvenile justice system. Schools [[Page H2427]] are also beginning to display an overreliance on law enforcement to maintain discipline through the use of school resource officers. Mr. Speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is the result of a dangerous precedent being set in our schools. Zero tolerance policies and the overreliance on law enforcement to keep order in our schools not only detracts from the culture of learning we expect in our schools, but also condemns countless children to a life of suffering for making simple mistakes during their youth. Our society will suffer if we continue on this path of forcing children into the criminal justice system and it is time that we considered serious reforms to keep children in our communities and outside the juvenile justice system. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2418-H2427] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members [[Page H2419]] may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous material relevant to the subject matter of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening as co-anchor along with my classmate and scholar, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, from the Eighth District of New York, for tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, Equal Justice Under the Law: Criminal Justice Reform and Challenging the School-to-Prison Pipeline. Congressman Jeffries leads by example. He is a member of the Criminal Justice Task Force, and he has a long personal and professional history of being a Brother's Keeper. This evening the Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor to discuss the current state of America's criminal justice system and the necessary reform, reform that will allow us to invest in our communities and expand opportunities for all Americans. Mr. Speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is an epidemic that is plaguing schools across the Nation. Mr. Speaker, the need and appetite to reform our Federal criminal justice system has been building for years, and now it is clear that there is consensus that the time is now to take meaningful action. The school-to-prison pipeline refers to the policies and practices that pushes our Nation's children, especially our most at-risk children, out of the classroom and into the juvenile and criminal justice system. Far too often, students are expended, expelled, or even arrested for minor offenses that lead to visits to the principal's office a thing of the past. Statistics reflect that these policies disproportionately target students of color and those with a history of abuse, neglect, poverty, or learning disabilities. Those who are unnecessarily forced out of school become stigmatized and fall behind in their studies, Mr. Speaker. Many eventually decide to drop out of school altogether, and many others commit crimes in their community. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder discussed the issue in a speech to the American Bar Association in 2013, stating that rigid discipline policies transformed too many educational institutions from the doorway of opportunity into the gateway to the criminal justice system and that a minor school disciplinary offense should put a student in the principal's office, not in the police precinct. According to recent data by the Department of Education, African American students are arrested far more than their White classmates. Black and Hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in school-related arrests or referrals to law enforcement. Currently, African Americans make up two-fifths of combined youth today, Mr. Speaker. In my home State of Ohio, the impact of suspensions and expulsions on communities is striking. In Ohio, a history of prior suspensions from school is the number one factor that leads children to dropping out of school. Children who do not finish high school, as we all are aware, are more likely to end up incarcerated or in our juvenile or criminal justice system and are 3.5 times more likely to be arrested. Approximately 82 percent of the adult population is composed of high school dropouts. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this is a pipeline that reflects the prioritization of incarceration over education. But, Mr. Speaker, I come today as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus because I believe we can disrupt the pipeline. To do this, we need to be honest about the opportunity gaps that exist across our country and in our schools because you cannot talk about the school-to-prison pipeline without discussing what needs to be provided as economic opportunities. We need better educational chances for our young people. We need more support to our families so that they can do the best job that they can or that they are capable of doing to help support their own children. We must confront prejudices in our Nation head-on. That is why initiatives like the White House's My Brother's Keeper is so important. My Brother's Keeper Task Force is a coordinated Federal effort to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Mr. Speaker, lastly, this past weekend I met with the dynamic men of the Columbus chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, in my district and saw My Brother's Keeper work firsthand. I learned of their many forms of being role models, as being community mentors for at-risk students, particularly young males, who are in need of inspiration and counsel regarding their choice of a life's career. The mentoring men of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, are men who are doctors, lawyers, government officials, teachers, and entrepreneurs, just to name a few. Mr. Speaker, these men are role models for the community. They bought a house in my district, and they use that home as an anchor to provide opportunities and leadership development, professional networking, and positive reinforcement. Tonight it is important for me to put a face on what we need to do as one small example to stop the school-to-prison pipeline. I salute Philip Shotwell, Polemarch; Richard Crockett, 1st Vice Polemarch; Attorney Byron Potts; Dr. Gus Parker; and Board of Directors Nathaniel Jordan for being men who understand, if we are going to stop the school-to-prison pipeline, we need to look at our own districts. A young man asked them why he should stay in school, and they replied: Young man, you are your own future. We are relying on you to be a law-abiding citizen, educated, self-sufficient, and a good citizen because we don't want you to be a statistic in the school-to-prison pipeline. Mr. Speaker, tonight you will hear many stories, you will hear facts, and you will hear about legislation. Let me end by saying that I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Safe, Accountable, Fair, Effective (SAFE) Justice Reinvestment Act of 2015, H.R. 2944, a bill that recognizes the importance of mentoring and reducing recidivism and helps offenders think through the decisions that confront them when they leave prison. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), our chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, a person who has a long background in being an advocate and a fighter for those who are in our communities and faced with many of the things that you are going to hear tonight. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Beatty for yielding, thank her for her friendship, and thank her for all that she does not just for the Congressional Black Caucus, but for all that she does for the constituents that she represents back in Ohio and for what she does for all people in America. Let me also thank Congressman Jeffries for his great work and his willingness to participate in these Special Order hours. I know that the evening is late sometimes, but the two of them come to the floor and work very hard. I want to spend my few minutes, if I may, Mr. Speaker, talking about just an overview of the criminal justice system. There is no question that the criminal justice system is broken. All of us I think can agree on that. Those on the left and those on the right, all of us even, for different reasons, perhaps, come to one conclusion, that the criminal justice system is in need of serious, serious reform. I know that we are debating legislation here in the House regarding reforming the criminal justice system. Our colleagues over in the Senate are doing the same. But it is time for action. It is time for action on criminal justice reform in the 114th Congress. As many of my colleagues know, I spent 30 years, 30 long years, in a courtroom, half of those as a lawyer, the other half as a judge. Most of the 15 years as a judge I was a trial judge, which meant that I was on the front line in our criminal justice system and I saw it firsthand. I can tell you without question that the criminal justice system in America is in need of serious reform from the top to the bottom. [[Page H2420]] We have all heard the statistics, and I am going to repeat them again tonight: 2.2 million Americans are in prison. Of that number, that number is disproportionately African American. That is 25 percent of the world's prison population right here in the United States of America. Just think about that, Mr. Speaker. We are 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of those who are incarcerated are incarcerated in the United States of America. We have a serious problem of mass incarceration that must be reduced. But the point that I want to put in the Record tonight is that, of those who are incarcerated in this country, 90 percent of those are incarcerated at the State level and 10 percent incarcerated at the Federal level--90 percent incarcerated at the State level. {time} 1930 When we discuss criminal justice reform--and Congressman Bobby Scott is going to be speaking in a few minutes, and he talks about this all of the time, as well as Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee--we must not only talk about reform at the Federal level, but we must find ways to require States to reform their criminal justice systems at the local level. We should encourage States to take a serious look at their systems and to seek ways to reduce mass incarceration at the State level without posing any harm to the communities. Too many of those who are incarcerated at the State level are in prison for drug-related offenses and crimes that don't endanger the community whatsoever. We should encourage States to enact expungement laws. We get telephone calls all the time--and I am sure my colleagues get the same calls as well--from those who are seeking ways to expunge their records so that young men and women who have served in the criminal justice system can get some of those offenses removed from their records, particularly those offenses that deal with petty crimes and misdemeanors and drug-related offenses, because when you have these offenses on your criminal record, it prevents young people from getting the gainful employment that they so richly deserve. We also need to encourage States to look at ways to remove criminal charges from criminal records that did not result in convictions. I think most of my colleagues can relate to that. We know that, so often, police officers at the local level will charge a young offender with multiple offenses at the time of arrest, and some of the offenses are not even deserving of a charge. Sometimes police have a tendency to overcharge at the time of arrest. Then when the case finally goes to court, those 10 or 12 charges are reduced down to one charge or two charges; the defendant pleads guilty; and the case is disposed of while the other 8 or 10 charges that are dismissed continue to be on the young person's criminal record for a lifetime. So often, just the fact that the individual has been charged with a crime prevents that young person from getting a job. So often, it makes a difference. Finally, I thank Mrs. Beatty for talking about using the court system to punish students. That happens. It happens in every State in America. Our public school systems cannot, and should not, use the court system as a means of punishment for students who have behavioral problems in school. I thank all of my colleagues for all of their work. I thank them for their efforts. I thank them for their tremendous interest in this subject because it is real. We know it. We need criminal justice reform, and we need it now. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank Congressman Butterfield. We certainly agree with you that the criminal justice system is broken. That is why the Congressional Black Caucus is here tonight--to make sure that we are prepared to outline the steps and the legislation that is going to be in the forefront. I thank the gentleman for his leadership in making this a top priority for the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentleman from the Third Congressional District of Virginia. He is a true scholar, an attorney, and someone who is a leader on tonight's topic. He is someone who has worked tirelessly to make sure that we do more than just come and stand and talk about this issue tonight. He comes to talk about real reform, to talk about making a difference in our broken criminal justice system. He is my friend, Congressman Bobby Scott. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlewoman. I appreciate the gentleman from New York and certainly the gentlewoman from Ohio for organizing this Special Order to discuss the need for criminal justice reform. Mr. Speaker, we have serious, fundamental problems with our criminal justice system today. For too long, policymakers have chosen to play politics with crime policy by enacting so-called tough on crime slogans and sound bites, such as three strikes and you are out, mandatory minimum sentences, and--if you get it to rhyme, apparently, it is better--if you do the adult crime, you do the adult time. As appealing as these policies sound, their impacts range from a negligible reduction in crime to actually increasing the crime rate. As a result of these policies, the United States, despite representing only 5 percent of the world's population, has 25 percent of the world's prisoners and now has the highest incarceration rate of any nation's, by far, in the world. There are 2.2 million people behind bars in this country. That is triple the number of prisoners we had just three decades ago. At over 700 persons incarcerated for every 100,000 in the population, the United States far exceeds the world's average incarceration rate of about 100 per 100,000. Recent studies have questioned the sanity of this mass incarceration. For example, the Pew Research Center on States estimates that after about 350 per 100,000, any crime reduction value begins to diminish, and at over 500 per 100,000, incarceration becomes, actually, counterproductive. As I said, our rate is now at 700 per 100,000. These counterproductive effects are created because today there are too many children who are being raised by a parent who is in prison and by too many people with felony records who are unable to find jobs. The impact of our tax dollars is also distressing. The Bureau of Prisons is consuming too much of the Department of Justice's budget, meaning that the Department has fewer and fewer resources for other programs that can actually reduce crime and enhance public safety. The tough on crime approach falls the hardest on minorities. While the incarceration rate overall in the United States is approximately 700 per 100,000, for Blacks, the incarceration rate is over 2,200 per 100,000; and in some jurisdictions, they lock up Blacks at the rate of 4,000 per 100,000--a rate 40 times the international average. The war on drugs has exacerbated this problem. Over 2,000 Federal prisoners are now serving life without parole for nonviolent drug crimes, and many more are serving unduly harsh sentences for nonviolent offenses. The racial disparities are staggering. Despite the fact that Whites engage in drug offenses at a rate equal to or often higher than that of African Americans, African Americans are incarcerated on drug charges at a rate 10 times greater than that of Whites. We all agree that there is a problem with mass incarceration. So what is the best way to solve it? When reviewing any legislative package called criminal justice reform, I think there are some key principles that we have to address. First, reform must meaningfully address the problem of mass incarceration by significantly reducing admissions to prison and shortening a prisoner's length of stay. Second, any reform must address the primary driver of the ballooning Federal prison populations, and that is mandatory minimum penalties, especially those for drug and firearm offenses. Third, we must address the disparate impact on race in the Federal criminal justice system that has resulted from the application of many neutrally worded policies and laws. Fourth, reform must address mental health and addiction issues as a public health issue and require intervention and treatment plans to resolve underlying issues that led those to be involved in the criminal justice system rather than implement so-called tough on crime, lock 'em up approaches. Everybody knows that the war on drugs [[Page H2421]] has failed. We need to address drug abuse more as a public health issue and less as a criminal justice issue. Fifth, we must provide comprehensive reentry and rehabilitation services and incentives for completing those programs that are found to actually work, with a particular focus on those with the greatest need. Finally, any legislation must be based on research and evidence, not on poll-tested slogans and sound bites or political negotiations, which are unrelated to research and evidence. How do the current proposals stack up? First, we look at the current bills that have been reported out of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees and notice that they fail to embody any of the principles. In fact, they often take the opposite approach. While these bills reduce the number of admissions and/or length of stay in some limited cases, they also create new mandatory minimums, even new mandatory minimums or mandatory consecutive enhancements. They enhance existing mandatory minimums to apply to people who would not get them under the present law, and they irrationally limit who can benefit from prospective and retroactive relief provisions. It is unknown whether there will be an overall increase or decrease in prison impact at the 10-year point after implementation, if these bills pass, compared to doing nothing. The United States Sentencing Commission has been unable to quantify the impact of the expansions or the limitations on relief. So the fact that we do not have the numbers means that we cannot determine whether these bills will have any meaningful effect on mass incarceration. Though the bills do shorten two supersized mandatory minimums, they do not eliminate any mandatory minimum. The Senate bill actually creates two new ones, and both bills create new mandatory consecutive sentencing enhancements, which must be served after any other sentence. Both bills expand mandatory minimums for drug and gun offenses by applying them to people who would not be eligible to receive them today. If the problem we are trying to address is mass incarceration, why are those in the bill to begin with? Neither of the bills will do anything to address the disparate racial impact that pervades our criminal justice system. Federal mandatory minimums, in particular those for drug and firearm offenses, have been studied and have been found to have a racially disparate impact. These bills do nothing to eliminate mandatory minimums. Even though they reduce some, they create new ones, expand others, and create new sentencing enhancements. So the bills may actually make racial disparities in sentencing even worse than they are under present law. Finally, both bills put limits on who can receive prospective and retroactive relief. If you look at the limitations, you will find that they have a racially disparate impact on minorities. On the issue of the war on drugs, both bills also fail to treat drug abuse and addiction as a public health problem. In fact, the strategy used in the bills to address heroin addiction is not a public health approach, for the bills impose mandatory additional prison time. This is not a public health, research-based approach. On the comprehensive reentry and rehabilitation services to reduce recidivism, these bills have turned science and empirical evidence upside down. They give the greatest incentives for completing the programs to those with the lowest need while categorically barring offenders with the highest risk from benefiting from the rehabilitation programs. This approach not only violates research, but it will exacerbate the current racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Mr. Speaker, there is ample research available to show what credible criminal justice reform ought to look like. For example, Texas--one of the Nation's most conservative States--recently passed criminal justice reform legislation that was based on research and evidence, and the result was a significant reduction in crime, a significant reduction in incarceration, and a savings of billions of dollars. The SAFE Justice Act--the Safe, Accountable, Fair, and Effective Justice Act--which I cosponsored with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), which the gentlewoman from Ohio pointed out that she is supporting, was based on the Texas model and includes evidence-based prevention and early intervention programs; reducing incarceration even at the State level as well as at the Federal level; comprehensive police training and funding for body cameras, drug and veterans' courts; a significant reduction in the use of mandatory minimum sentences; and rehabilitation for all of those in prison and second- chance programs for those who have been released. It has broad, bipartisan support. All of the provisions in the bill are fully paid for by reallocating the reduction in mandatory minimums, and it shows that we do not have to accept a bill that fails to conform to evidence and research. Mr. Speaker, criminal justice reform legislation ought to be consistent with the research and evidence that is readily available. From what I can tell, the bills reported out of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have nothing based in research and evidence and, sadly, seem more concerned about the politics of criminal justice reform, with little regard to actually wanting to end our Nation's addiction to mass incarceration. The SAFE Justice Act is a better evidence-based approach, which will, if enacted, reduce crime, save money, and reduce racial disparities that pervade our criminal justice system. I appreciate the gentlewoman from Ohio and the gentleman from New York for hosting tonight's Special Order. {time} 1945 Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Scott for clearly articulating to us why we cannot let our criminal justice system remain on this trajectory. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the Congresswoman from the 13th District of California. My colleague and my friend is someone who travels the world advocating for those who live in poverty, advocating for those who are incarcerated in this broken criminal justice system that we are focusing on tonight. I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I first thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for those very kind and humbling remarks. I want to thank her for her tremendous leadership and for continuing to come down here each and every week to ensure that her voice, the Congressional Black Caucus' voice, and Congressman Jeffries' voice are really put forth so that the people of our country will understand the critical issues before us and the fact that the Congressional Black Caucus is really leading on each and every issue. Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman Jeffries really have done a phenomenal job. They both have gone way beyond the call of duty, and so we thank them so much for their efforts. Make no mistake--and I think we are hearing this over and over again tonight--mass incarceration is a crisis in our country. The United States of America imprisons far more people than any other nation in the world. When African Americans are incarcerated at six times the rate of Whites, it is no surprise to me. It is no surprise that African Americans constitute nearly half of the total 2.3 million incarcerated Americans in 2008. Together, African Americans and Latinos comprise 58 percent of all prisoners in 2008, even though African Americans and Latinos make up approximately one-quarter of the United States population. While our prison population grows unchecked and is growing unchecked, we continue to criminalize our students rather than invest in their education. Right now we spend $10,500 a year to educate a child, but we spend $88,000 a year to keep a child locked up. That is unacceptable. Let me repeat that. It costs eight times more money to keep a child in jail than to educate them and prepare them for a good future. We are not just talking about a few children here. Our country incarcerates five times more children than any other nation in the world. Sadly, two-thirds of these kids will never return to school. When we lock up these children, we are essentially throwing away [[Page H2422]] the key. Instead of preparing them for a future, we are just getting them ready for a life in a cell. Now, let me be clear, from the moment many of these children are born, they are funneled into the prison pipeline. Simply put, the system is really stacked against them. For instance, one in three African American children lives in poverty today, while one in four Hispanic children lives in poverty. Mr. Speaker, while Black children represent just 18 percent of preschool enrollment, they account for nearly half of all preschool suspensions. Now, Congresswoman Beatty, we are talking toddlers ages 2 to 5. These kids don't even get a start, let alone a head start. They are being suspended from school. How do you suspend toddlers and babies from school? Something is wrong with this. So we, I must say, in the Appropriations Committee are trying to address this with the Department of Education. This is immoral. When they get older, African American students are four times more likely to be expelled from school than their White peers for the same offense. More than half of all students who are involved in school- related arrests or referred to law enforcement are Black or Latino. This has a lasting effect and impact on young students. Studies show that students who are disciplined by schools are more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system where their chances of returning to school are slim to none. This is unacceptable. These young people are having their futures ripped away before they even have a chance. We need to change the system and end the school-to-prison pipeline. First, we must start by making serious investments in our young people. We should ensure that all students have equal access to high-quality public school education. We must also expand summer youth job opportunities and summer training programs so that our teens have the opportunity to learn workforce skills, contribute to their communities, and start a path to economic opportunity. As a member of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, we are working to try to make sure that these resources become a priority of our subcommittee, which they, unfortunately, aren't at this point. We also need to tear down the institutional racism, quite frankly, that is holding students of color back and trapping our young people in a broken criminal justice system. I am reminded of when I was in the California legislature. I was on the public safety committee, and proposals were brought to us, plans for building prisons 10 to 12 years out for kids who are just starting kindergarten. That is what we had to deal with. Now we see what has happened to the prison industrial complex in California. That is why we must work together and pass legislation to end mass incarceration and fix our broken criminal justice system. We need to get rid of these outdated minimum sentencing standards. These are relics from the failed war on drugs and disproportionately target people of color. In California, once again, the three strikes law passed. Of course, I opposed that while in the California legislature. This law has incarcerated young African American men for nonviolent drug offenses 25 years to life. That is 25 years to life for nonviolent drug offenses. We need to repeal that law. We also need to make sure that law enforcement officers reflect the diversity of communities that they police. So we have introduced H. Res. 262, which supports effective community-oriented policing and encourages greater diversity in law enforcement. During the last appropriation season, the Congressional Black Caucus worked with Congressman Lacy Clay to direct the Department of Justice to begin collecting training data. Our legislation tracks when officers receive training for use of force, racial and ethnic bias, de- escalation of conflict, and constructive engagement with the public. This was just a small step, and we need to do more. With regard to reentry, banning the box is essential. We have worked with the White House to try to make sure that Federal contractors ban the box. We haven't accomplished that, but Federal agencies cannot now ask for one's criminal history records. In my district, we do expungement, we do record remedies. We have remedied thousands and thousands of young people who now can go on and move forward with their lives. I want to thank the Family Law Center in Oakland, California, for doing that. We need to go back to the drawing board and repeal the welfare reform provisions that are denied for life. There is a Federal ban for food stamps, eligibility for public housing, and Pell grants for those who have been incarcerated for drug felonies. Now, you know who that targets; primarily African American and Latino men. They don't even have a second chance when they get out of jail as a result of these lifetime bans. Finally, let me just say it is time to really look at this problem in a big way and to understand that we have to dismantle, not reform--but we have to dismantle this prison industrial complex and start investing in our communities, especially our young children. And we must understand that, in doing this, we have to look at institutional and systemic racism, which is at the core of many of our policies. So this is a fight that we are going to win, but it is going to be because all of us here in the Congressional Black Caucus--Congresswoman Beatty, Congressman Jeffries, Congressman Scott, and Congresswoman Jackson Lee, and the entire membership--continue to fight the good fight to make sure that finally we will begin to see a real criminal justice system, which it is not right now. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lee. When people ask us why are we doing this today, I thank the gentlewoman for reminding us that the system is stacked against us and that we have had the future of so many of our young folks ripped away from them. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of Ohio (Ms. Fudge). She is from the 11th Congressional District. She is an attorney. She has served as a former mayor. She is the immediate past chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. She is someone who gives us advice. I remember her saying to us: Push the envelope because you are the voice for the voiceless. Look at the legislative issues that will make a difference in the lives of others. So tonight we come to talk about equal justice under the law. Mr. Speaker, we come to challenge this House. It is my great honor to yield to Congresswoman Marcia Fudge. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. It is a pleasure to watch my fellow Ohioan and friend and the gentleman from New York on this House floor every Monday night bringing the message of the Congressional Black Caucus because indeed they are the people who carry our message to the United States. Mr. Speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is robbing far too many children of productive futures. Instead of learning in classrooms, a large percentage of our Nation's at-risk students sit in jail cells. The numbers don't lie. Black students are suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater than White students. More than one in four boys of color with disabilities and nearly one in five girls of color with disabilities receives an out-of-school suspension. And studies show that students who are suspended or expelled in school are more likely to end up in prison. Our Nation's children deserve better. It is time we prioritize education and not incarceration. Comprehensive criminal justice reform must include policies which dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline. We must reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, a bill that funds delinquency prevention and improvements in State and local juvenile justice programs, supports restorative initiatives, and promotes early intervention. Disrupting the pipeline will provide a pathway for a successful future and lessen the burden on our current judicial system. The number of people incarcerated in America quadrupled between 1980 and 2008. Of the more than 2.3 million Americans incarcerated today, more than 1 million of them are Black. In my home State of Ohio, more than 50,000 people are incarcerated in a system that was designed to only hold [[Page H2423]] 39,000. And on average, States across this Nation spend $30,000 per year to house one inmate. That is at least $19,000 more per year than we spend to educate one child. It is time we get our priorities straight. As ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, promoting policies that keep our children in school is one of my top priorities. I ask my colleagues: What are yours? Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Fudge for reminding us again of the value and the importance of our work. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is indeed my honor to yield time to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), who is coanchor of tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. As I said earlier, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries is not only a scholar, he, too, is an attorney. He is someone who walks the talk. He is someone who has a long history of being a Brother's Keeper. Mr. Speaker, so tonight, when we discuss this topic, when we talked about the challenge, when we talked about all of the plethora of things that are incorporated in why we must come forward tonight to challenge the criminal justice system which is stacked against us and broken, certainly we have heard the disparities as it relates to African Americans. So it is indeed my honor to ask my coanchor, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, to share with us our challenge. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio, my good friend, the distinguished and dynamic anchor for tonight's Special Order, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, for yielding and for her continued leadership and for leading the discussion on the House floor today as it relates the urgency of this Congress and America dealing with the school-to-prison pipeline mass incarceration and the prison industrial complex that so many of my colleagues have explained and exposed here on the House floor today. A few years ago I had a conversation that has always stuck with me in the area of criminal justice when I was speaking to a formally incarcerated individual who spent several years behind bars incarcerated in a New York State penitentiary. He has turned his life around and he is now an advocate for criminal justice reform. He said to me on his final day, after being imprisoned for years in upstate New York, that he had a conversation with a high-ranking corrections officer, a supervisor who he had gotten to know and thought he had befriended to some degree during his time of incarceration. {time} 2000 On that last day, he said to this young African American incarcerated individual who was on his way out, he said: I just want to thank you. This gentleman was a little perplexed. He wasn't sure what he was talking about. He said: I just want to thank you for helping me to get my boat; and beyond that, I want to thank your son, who is going to help my son get his boat as well. That conversation has really haunted me because, in such a powerful and profound way, what it captures is the essence of what the prison industrial complex represents, which is this decision that was made in so many parts of the United States of America, certainly in New York, by Democrats and Republicans. When the automobile factories and the steel mills, the manufacturing plants began to close in the 1970s and in the 1980s, devastating parts of the upstate economy, a decision was made in place of those factory jobs to build prisons in their place as a means of economic development for depressed upstate communities. But here is the problem. If you build it, someone has got to fill those prisons. In order to fill those prisons, several things have developed which we are in the process of trying to dismantle right now: the school-to-prison pipeline and the criminalization of young people, particularly in communities of color, where they basically are not given a chance from the very beginning. As a result of being channeled unjustly, often, into the criminal justice system at an early age, they essentially become economic commodities for those who have come to rely on prisons to replace the factory and manufacturing jobs that have left the United States of America. That has been a big problem in New York. It is a problem in other parts of the country. It is a shame here in the United States of America that we have gone from a place where, when the war on drugs began in 1971--President Nixon declared drug abuse public enemy number one--there were less than 350,000 people incarcerated in America. Even when the crime bill that is being heavily debated in the public domain right now was passed in 1994, at the height of the concern about crime here in the United States of America, the incarcerated population was still under 900,000 people. But we have gone from less than 350,000 in 1971 to under 900,000 in 1994 to more than 2.2 million in 2016. The United States has 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's incarcerated individuals. We incarcerate more people than any other country in the world, and it is shameful. The school-to-prison pipeline is a large part of that dynamic, along with the failed war on drugs. So we are going to have to deal with this situation in a meaningful way. The statistics clearly show that, if you suspend a young person, that individual--often a Black or Latino boy--is less likely to graduate and complete school and more likely to become entangled in the criminal justice system because we have applied an overly punitive approach to discipline, particularly in the inner city. Now, in this Chamber, I have seen surprising levels of compassion as it relates to dealing with the heroin and opioid crisis that is sweeping across America right now, and I am glad that folks have decided to take a different approach than the approach that was taken in the 1980s with the crack cocaine epidemic that was sweeping across communities that those of us in the Congressional Black Caucus represent. I welcome this newfound compassion. I just hope that you would extend it now not just to the manner in which we deal with the heroin crisis-- that is important--but let's extend it to the overcriminalization that is taking place as relates to young people across America, particularly in Black and Brown communities. I am glad that we have become enlightened as it relates to moving away from punishment and toward prevention and intervention related to the heroin and opioid crisis. Let's also become enlightened in terms of dealing with breaking the school-to-prison pipeline. We will have more to say as we move forward with this discussion, but I know there are other Members who would like to contribute to this hour of power that Representative Joyce Beatty has brought to the House floor in connection with the CBC Special Order. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jeffries for reminding us that the United States makes up less than 5 percent of the world's population, yet incarcerates nearly a quarter of the global prison population. Thank you for also being on point and reminding us, Mr. Speaker, if we are to reform America's criminal justice system and advance efforts to break the cycles of incarceration in African American communities, in low-income communities, then we must unite and make sure that we pass real legislation. Mr. Speaker, can you advise me how much time we have left, please. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Ohio has 12 minutes remaining. Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is indeed my honor to yield to the gentlewoman who hails from the 18th Congressional District of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Of the many things that this Congresswoman does, she serves on the Committee on the Judiciary, she has been a longtime advocate for reforming the criminal justice system. I refer to her as a strong voice, a strong advocate, and, truly, a scholar. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to add my appreciation to the gentlewoman from Ohio; the gentleman from New York; and the Members who [[Page H2424]] have spoken, including the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Butterfield; the former chair, Ms. Fudge; and the ranking member on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, Mr. Scott. There could not be a more important topic than the topic that we are speaking about tonight. There are moments in history that I think come at times when urgency is the call of the day. It is often said that Dr. King emphasized in his tenure the urgency of moving forward on civil rights and spoke eloquently about the fact of why we cannot wait. If I might, I want to capture his theme of why we cannot wait to end the school-to-prison pipeline. End it now and begin the whole comprehensive approach of criminal justice reform. Let me take Texas as an example and cite some very important statistics from the Appleseed Report and as well a comment on the work that we are doing in the Committee on the Judiciary. I am so glad at this moment in history to be the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations and working with the members of my subcommittee, including Mr. Jeffries, who is a member, Ms. Bass, who is a member, and a number of other members as well, on this very difficult hurdle that we have. Let it be very clear that this hurdle of criminal justice reform is, as I heard Mr. Jeffries make mention of, that we have taken hold of this issue of opioids and heroin in a way that not one single bill was passed last week that had a criminal focus, particularly out of the Committee on the Judiciary. Not one bill had mandatory minimums. In the debate last week, on Friday, I reiterated over and over again no mandatory minimums in this legislation. That should be the perfect that we try to achieve going forward on criminal justice reform. But let me give the beginnings of that very tragic outcome in America, filling up the Nation's prisons, not having criminal justice but criminal unfairness. It starts with a path to incarceration, which includes in the schools, stops, failing public schools, zero tolerance and other school discipline, police in school hallways, disciplinary alternative schools, and court involvement in juvenile detention. All of these are a path for students to incarceration, and it is without understanding what a class C misdemeanor ticket and a trip to court for thousands of Texas students and their families means. Texas students as young as 6 have been ticketed at school in past years, and it is not uncommon for elementary school students to be ticketed by school-based law enforcement. School-based arrest of students often occurs without prior notice to parents. Police officers in some Texas schools are resorting to use of force, measures more commonly associated with fighting street crime: pepper spray, tasers, and trained canines when a schoolyard fight breaks out or when students are misbehaving in a cafeteria or at a school event. This should not be the picture for a 6-year-old or a 4-year-old or an 8-year-old or an 11-year-old or a 13-year-old. This should not be equated with school. Let me read to you part of the Appleseed Report and a quote by Ryan Kellus Turner and Mark Goodner: ``In a little over two decades, a paradigm shift has occurred in the Lone Star State. The misdeeds of children--acts that in the near recent past resulted in trips to the principal's office, corporal punishment, or extra laps under the supervision of a middle school or high school coach . . . '' Now, of course, corporal punishment will be eliminated from that. What is worse, `` . . . now result in criminal prosecution, criminal records, and untold millions of dollars in punitive fines and hefty court costs being imposed against children ages 10 through 16.'' ``It is conservatively estimated that more than 275,000 non-traffic tickets are issued to juveniles in Texas each year . . . '' And based on the information from the Texas Office of Court Administration, the number of non-traffic tickets issued to students may well grossly exceed that number because it was very difficult to get it. ``Texas can interrupt this destructive cycle and prevent the loss of more young people to the `school-to-prison pipeline' through early interventions focused less on punishment and more on creating positive school environments that address students' academic and behavioral needs.'' Let me just say that ``police officers in some Texas schools are resorting to `use of force.' '' Now, they are supposed to be there as SROs. SROs are supposed to have educational training. SROs are supposed to be able to have the understanding of how to deal with counseling issues and teaching that is evidence based, but here is the problem. The problem is that they are focused more on law enforcement. I am glad to be part of this Special Order tonight that deals with the pipeline that has started working our children toward incarceration: overcrowded schools, lack of qualified teachers, inadequate resources, and then the zero tolerance for school discipline of children and the rate of suspension having increased dramatically in recent years from 1.7 million in 1974 to 3.1 million in 2000; and it has gone beyond that, and the greatest emphasis has been on children of color. So here is my call to the United States Congress. We have to begin the process of dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline. We have to understand that children can learn. No child is a throwaway. I offer that often in my remarks in my district. The detention system is an unfair system. I don't know how many of you realize that when a child is sent to juvie, that child can remain there until they reach the age of 21. How does that happen? Even if their sentence is not as egregious as one might think--a simple misbehavior in school. The way that happens is because in juvenile, you can assess more time on a child without telling that child's parent because that child did not follow orders or, in essence, that child did not behave or that child chewed gum when you told them not to. {time} 2015 We in the Judiciary Committee are working on juvenile justice reform. One of them that I am most concerned about and want to move is ending solitary confinement for juveniles, recognizing Kalief's Law, involving the death of one inside the New York prison at Rikers Island. The individual in solitary confinement had not been rendered guilty yet. And so we want to eliminate putting juveniles in solitary confinement. Because the tragedy, Mr. Speaker, was that that youngster was released, ultimately, but after he was released, he, in essence, committed suicide. So I want to close my remarks by indicating that I want to turn this system upside down. I want to make sure that we deal with juvenile justice reform. I want to ban the box. We have done that in legislation that has not yet passed. I want to make sure that we have alternative sentencing. At the same time, the Judiciary Committee has moved two bills out of committee. I want to see these bills have a vigorous discussion and debate on the floor of the House so that we can move to conference. Time is going by. Let us not let the perfect be, in essence, the downfall of change. H.R. 3713 provides for the reduction of sentencing for many who are languishing, by law, in prison today in the Federal system. As I have spoken to people across the country, they have indicated that, even though some States like my State of Texas have made enormous, enormous strides--I am proud of that--it has not happened around the country. The bully pulpit of the Federal Government can be the most effective tool to moving toward criminal justice reform and sentencing reduction dealing with felony drug offenses. We are moving toward that point. A vote on the floor of the House and moving toward conference can move our efforts toward legislation that can truly be responsive to both concerns and as well positives that are in that bill. So as we deal with this prison pipeline, we have to not only talk, we have to do. And when we do, we have to make sure that we respond to the concerns, but we also have to make sure that we move legislation that can ultimately come out of the Senate and go to conference and make a difference in the lives of so many. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio. I also want to say how [[Page H2425]] timely the Congressional Black Caucus is. All that have been crying out, from Black Lives Matter to the Mother of the Movement, say that we need changes dealing with the whole vastness of criminal justice reform: police-community relations, police actions, actions dealing with guns, actions dealing with the loss of life of our young people. Let's get a framework that can allow us to debate, to fix, to amend, and to get a product that will ultimately be signed by the President of the United States on behalf of the people of the United States who are crying out for relief. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) who are anchoring this Special Order on Ending the School-to-Prison Pipeline. The over-criminalization of school children in America can no longer be swept under the rug, ignored or irrationally justified. We are in a state of national crisis and it is time to act. Upon taking office, every Member of Congress makes a solemn pledge: to protect and defend the American people. This is the most important oath we take as elected officials--and, to honor this promise, we must do everything in our power to stem the School-to-Prison Pipeline in our nation. The three most important concerns for Members of Congress today are No. 1 Children, No. 2 Children, and No. 3 Children. House Republicans are still unwilling to act to stop the criminalization of our children in schools and instead work towards providing children the opportunity to thrive in American communities. This Congress has a moral obligation to do our part to end the epidemic of losing our children to the correctional system. Now is the time for Republicans to join Democrats in protecting the lives of America's youth by taking common sense steps in redirecting those who go astray. Over the past year, several proposals have been introduced to address the need for overarching reform of our nation's criminal justice system. Americans must consider the educational environment in which we place our students, from preschool to high school, subjecting them to disciplinary policies that more closely resemble policing than teaching. Around the country, advocates are collecting data illustrating the devastating effects of what they call the ``school-to-prison pipeline,'' where student behavior is criminalized, children are treated like prisoners and, all too often, actually end up behind bars. The school-to-prison pipeline refers to interlocking sets of relationships at the institutional/structural and the individual levels. All of these policies and practices work together to push our nation's schoolchildren--youth of color, especially, our most at-risk children--out of schools and into unemployment and into the juvenile and criminal justice legal systems. This pipeline reflects the prioritization of incarceration over education. For a growing number of students, the path to incarceration includes the ``stops'' deterring matriculation such as: 1) Failing Public Schools; 2) Zero-Tolerance and Other School Discipline; 3) Policing School Hallways; 4) Disciplinary Alternative Schools; and 5) Court Involvement and Juvenile Detention. In a little over two decades, a paradigm shift has occurred in the Lone Star State. The misdeeds of children--acts that in the near recent past resulted in trips to the principal's office, corporal punishment, or extra laps under the supervision of a middle school or high school coach, now result in criminal prosecution, criminal records, and untold millions of dollars in punitive fines and hefty court costs being imposed against children in elementary and high schools. Disrupting class, using profanity, misbehaving on a school bus, student fights, and truancy once meant a trip to the principal's office. Today, such misbehavior results in a Class C misdemeanor ticket and a trip to court for thousands of Texas students and their families each year. It is conservatively estimated that more than 275,000 non-traffic tickets are issued to juveniles in Texas each year. While it is impossible to pinpoint how many of these tickets are issued by campus police, the vast majority of these tickets are issued for offenses most commonly linked to school-related misbehavior-- disruption of class, disorderly conduct, disruption of transportation, truancy, and simple assaults related to student fights. ``Criminalization'' of student misbehavior extends to even the youngest students. In Texas, students as young as six have been ticketed at school in the past five years, and it is not uncommon for elementary-school students to be ticketed by school-based law enforcement. School-based arrest of students often occurs without prior notice to parents or a lawyer being present during initial questioning of the student. The increase in ticketing and arrest of students, in Texas and nationwide, has coincided with the growth in school-based policing. Campus policing is the largest and fastest growing area of law enforcement in Texas, according to its own professional association. With counselors stretched to handle class scheduling and test administration duties, school administrators and teachers are increasingly turning to campus police officers to handle student behavior problems. Today in Texas, most public schools have a police officer assigned to patrol hallways, lunchrooms, school grounds, and after-school events. Police officers in some Texas schools are resorting to ``use of force'' measures more commonly associated with fighting street crime-- pepper spray, Tasers and trained canines--when a schoolyard fight breaks out or when students are misbehaving in a cafeteria or at a school event. The intent is to keep schools and students safe, but there can be unintended consequences to disciplining public school students in a way that introduces them to the justice system or exposes them to policing techniques more commonly used with adults. Texas can interrupt this destructive cycle and prevent the loss of more young people to the ``school-to-prison pipeline'' through early interventions focused less on punishment and more on creating positive school environments that address students' academic and behavioral needs. We must seek appropriate recommendations for reform. For most students, the pipeline begins with inadequate resources in public schools. Overcrowded classrooms, a lack of qualified teachers, and insufficient funding for ``extras'' such as counselors, special education services, and even textbooks, lock students into second-rate educational environments. This failure to meet educational needs increases disengagement and dropouts, increasing the risk of later court involvement. Even worse, schools may actually encourage dropouts in response to pressures from test-based accountability regimes such as the No Child Left Behind Act, which create incentives to push out low-performing students to boost overall test scores. Lacking resources, facing incentives to push out low-performing students, and responding to a handful of highly-publicized school shootings, schools have embraced zero-tolerance policies that automatically impose severe punishment regardless of circumstances. Under these policies, students have been expelled for bringing nail clippers or scissors to school. Rates of suspension have increased dramatically in recent years--from 1.7 million in 1974 to 3.1 million in 2000--and have been most dramatic for children of color. Overly harsh disciplinary policies push students down the pipeline and into the juvenile justice system. Suspended and expelled children are often left unsupervised and without constructive activities. They also can easily fall behind in their coursework, leading to a greater likelihood of disengagement and drop-outs. All of these factors increase the likelihood of court involvement. As harsh penalties for minor misbehavior become more pervasive, schools increasingly ignore or bypass due process protections for suspensions and expulsions. The lack of due process is particularly acute for students with special needs, who are disproportionately represented in the pipeline despite the heightened protections afforded to them under law. Many under-resourced schools become ``pipeline gateways'' by placing increased reliance on police rather than teachers and administrators to maintain discipline. Growing numbers of districts employ school resource officers to patrol school hallways, often with little or no training in working with youth. As a result, children are far more likely to be subject to school- based arrests--the majority of which are for non-violent offenses, such as disruptive behavior--than they were a generation ago. The rise in school-based arrests, the quickest route from the classroom to the jailhouse, most directly exemplifies the criminalization of school children. In some jurisdictions, students who have been suspended or expelled have been completely denied their right to an education. In others, they are sent to disciplinary alternative schools. [[Page H2426]] Growing in number across the country, these shadow systems--sometimes run by private, for-profit companies--are immune from educational accountability standards (such as minimum classroom hours and curriculum requirements) and may fail to provide meaningful educational services to the students who need them the most. As a result, struggling students return to their regular schools unprepared, are permanently locked into inferior educational settings, or are funneled through alternative schools into the juvenile justice system. Youth who become involved in the juvenile justice system are often denied procedural protections in the courts. Studies demonstrate that as many as 80 percent of court-involved children do not have lawyers. Students who commit minor offenses may end up in secured detention if they violate boilerplate probation conditions prohibiting them from activities like missing school or disobeying teachers. Students pushed along the pipeline find themselves in juvenile detention facilities, many of which provide few, if any, educational services. Students of color, who are far more likely than their white peers to be suspended, expelled, or arrested for the same kind of conduct at school, and those with disabilities are particularly likely to travel down this pipeline. Though many students are propelled down the pipeline from school to jail, it is difficult for them to make the journey in reverse. Students who enter the juvenile justice system face many barriers to their re-entry into traditional schools. The vast majority of these students never graduate from high school. Numerous studies have also shown that as many as 70-80 percent of youth involved in the justice system meet the criteria for a disability. We must move away from the engrained culture of criminalization as the answer to our problems. It is no secret that 1 in every 3 black males born today can expect to go to prison at some point in their life, compared with 1 in every 6 Latino males, and 1 in every 17 white males. It is a statistic we know well because it is one that has been reported since 2001 and has remained unchanged for nearly 15 years. It is time we stop repeating and start understanding and unraveling the fateful 1 in 3 trend that continues to sweep entire generations of young men of color into a lifetime of systematic and barriers. The United States currently has the largest number of prisoners in the world due to its skyrocketing national imprisonment rate. Rather than investing in premier educational responses, the United States pays the highest cost globally for incarceration. Federal, state, and local leaders are looking for innovative ways to improve public health and public safety outcomes, while reducing the costs of criminal justice and corrections. A number of innovative strategies can save public funds and improve public health by keeping low-risk, non-violent, drug-involved offenders out of prison or jail, while still holding them accountable and ensuring the safety of our communities. The Obama Administration is committed to funding and evaluating the long-term effects of these innovative criminal justice and corrections interventions. I too call upon my colleagues to come together and pass legislation that will help stop the derailment of children's lives. Meanwhile, Federal agencies will continue to seek opportunities to expand smart probation and problem-solving court initiatives around the country in collaboration with state, local, and tribal agencies. In recognition of the considerable potential in cost savings, improved outcomes for offenders, and improved public safety, a growing number of state and local officials around the country are starting their own promising initiatives to break the cycle of drug use, crime, and incarceration. Nearly every state is struggling with significant shortfalls in revenue and making significant cuts to spending in order to close budget gaps. In making these cuts, many states are focusing attention on corrections spending, one of the fastest growing lines in state budgets over the past two decades. Many states are pursuing a justice reinvestment approach, using data to determine what has been driving the growth in the prison population and how that growth might be stopped. In addition, small investments have been made in programs designed to reduce recidivism. New policies have been enacted, slowing the growth of prison populations or even downsizing corrections systems, saving states hundreds of millions of dollars. A portion of those savings are being reinvested in community-based services and supports, including substance abuse treatment. However, to have meaningful impact on behaviors that contribute to crime, recidivism, and substance abuse, states must focus on a handful of proven strategies that will maximize the impact of limited investments being made in the treatment of substance use disorders and community supervision. I am a strong supporter of education and I am particularly sensitive and protective of measures to keep students safe in school. In this same spirit, we must invest in a multi-step, collaborative process that involves the combined efforts of law enforcement, prosecutors, influential community members, social services, reentry services, community corrections, faith-based organizations, and city management. We have seen too often the horrific abuses of school officers dragging, punching, slapping, and more to students. First and foremost school-based law enforcement personnel need to be removed from the educational setting. And if law enforcement are not removed, they should be required to receive post-certification training in issues specific to youth, including: 1) de-escalation and mediation techniques; 2) restraint techniques to be used when force cannot be avoided; 3) signs and symptoms of trauma, abuse and neglect in children and youth, as well as appropriate responses; 4) signs and symptoms of mental illness in children and youth, and appropriate responses; and 5) manifestations of other disabilities, such as autism, and appropriate responses, adolescent development, Juvenile law, and Special education and applicable general education law. Prohibit school districts from receiving any revenue from Class C ticketing for truancy or any other offense. Eliminate Disruption of Class and Disruption of Transportation as penal code offenses. Prohibit ticketing of students under the age of 14. Young children are simply not equipped to understand a Class C misdemeanor ticket as a meaningful consequence of misbehavior, and the consequences of court involvement on academic success are too great to allow this practice to continue. Ticketing of older students should be a last resort. Ticketing, arrest and use of force in schools is preposterously reshaping today's school disciplinary policies disproportionately to actual need. We must acknowledge this epidemic and move to correct the inevitable injustice that follows when our children are derailed from their futures. I thank my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) for hosting this Special Order on Ending the School-to-Prison Pipeline. It is an invaluable and much needed effort. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, let me just end by saying that the urgency is now. In the words of Nelson Mandela, ``It always seems impossible until it's done.'' Tonight the Congressional Black Caucus says: Let's get it done. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, our children represent the future of our nation. Our future is more promising when our children have a clear path to succeed and have the opportunities to become active members of the community. Over time, a culture of favoring incarceration over education has become more prominent throughout our society--particularly as it relates to minority and low- income populations. Financial shortfalls at all levels of government are also placing downward pressure on states and municipalities to cut back on public services and educational or community-based programs in favor of harsh criminalization or incarceration. The result is the ``school-to-prison pipeline,'' which poses a very real threat to our children and our society. This pipeline refers to harsh policies and practices that cultivate a culture where young individuals are pushed into the juvenile and criminal justice systems through harsh punishments in schools. Inadequate resources in public schools, economic instability, zero-tolerance policies, and harsh punishments for non-violent offenses are all contributing to the school-to-prison pipeline. As a result, the United States suffers from the largest number of prisoners in the world and the economic and social burden of the high costs of incarceration. Zero tolerance policies are dangerous to have in our schools. These policies impose extremely severe punishments on students, regardless of the circumstances, which can result in suspension or even expulsion from school. Children of color and students with special needs have experienced a dramatic increase in these suspensions and expulsions, which greatly increase their probability of entering into the juvenile justice system. Schools [[Page H2427]] are also beginning to display an overreliance on law enforcement to maintain discipline through the use of school resource officers. Mr. Speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is the result of a dangerous precedent being set in our schools. Zero tolerance policies and the overreliance on law enforcement to keep order in our schools not only detracts from the culture of learning we expect in our schools, but also condemns countless children to a life of suffering for making simple mistakes during their youth. Our society will suffer if we continue on this path of forcing children into the criminal justice system and it is time that we considered serious reforms to keep children in our communities and outside the juvenile justice system. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2418-H2427] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members [[Page H2419]] may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous material relevant to the subject matter of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening as co-anchor along with my classmate and scholar, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, from the Eighth District of New York, for tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, Equal Justice Under the Law: Criminal Justice Reform and Challenging the School-to-Prison Pipeline. Congressman Jeffries leads by example. He is a member of the Criminal Justice Task Force, and he has a long personal and professional history of being a Brother's Keeper. This evening the Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor to discuss the current state of America's criminal justice system and the necessary reform, reform that will allow us to invest in our communities and expand opportunities for all Americans. Mr. Speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is an epidemic that is plaguing schools across the Nation. Mr. Speaker, the need and appetite to reform our Federal criminal justice system has been building for years, and now it is clear that there is consensus that the time is now to take meaningful action. The school-to-prison pipeline refers to the policies and practices that pushes our Nation's children, especially our most at-risk children, out of the classroom and into the juvenile and criminal justice system. Far too often, students are expended, expelled, or even arrested for minor offenses that lead to visits to the principal's office a thing of the past. Statistics reflect that these policies disproportionately target students of color and those with a history of abuse, neglect, poverty, or learning disabilities. Those who are unnecessarily forced out of school become stigmatized and fall behind in their studies, Mr. Speaker. Many eventually decide to drop out of school altogether, and many others commit crimes in their community. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder discussed the issue in a speech to the American Bar Association in 2013, stating that rigid discipline policies transformed too many educational institutions from the doorway of opportunity into the gateway to the criminal justice system and that a minor school disciplinary offense should put a student in the principal's office, not in the police precinct. According to recent data by the Department of Education, African American students are arrested far more than their White classmates. Black and Hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in school-related arrests or referrals to law enforcement. Currently, African Americans make up two-fifths of combined youth today, Mr. Speaker. In my home State of Ohio, the impact of suspensions and expulsions on communities is striking. In Ohio, a history of prior suspensions from school is the number one factor that leads children to dropping out of school. Children who do not finish high school, as we all are aware, are more likely to end up incarcerated or in our juvenile or criminal justice system and are 3.5 times more likely to be arrested. Approximately 82 percent of the adult population is composed of high school dropouts. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this is a pipeline that reflects the prioritization of incarceration over education. But, Mr. Speaker, I come today as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus because I believe we can disrupt the pipeline. To do this, we need to be honest about the opportunity gaps that exist across our country and in our schools because you cannot talk about the school-to-prison pipeline without discussing what needs to be provided as economic opportunities. We need better educational chances for our young people. We need more support to our families so that they can do the best job that they can or that they are capable of doing to help support their own children. We must confront prejudices in our Nation head-on. That is why initiatives like the White House's My Brother's Keeper is so important. My Brother's Keeper Task Force is a coordinated Federal effort to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Mr. Speaker, lastly, this past weekend I met with the dynamic men of the Columbus chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, in my district and saw My Brother's Keeper work firsthand. I learned of their many forms of being role models, as being community mentors for at-risk students, particularly young males, who are in need of inspiration and counsel regarding their choice of a life's career. The mentoring men of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, are men who are doctors, lawyers, government officials, teachers, and entrepreneurs, just to name a few. Mr. Speaker, these men are role models for the community. They bought a house in my district, and they use that home as an anchor to provide opportunities and leadership development, professional networking, and positive reinforcement. Tonight it is important for me to put a face on what we need to do as one small example to stop the school-to-prison pipeline. I salute Philip Shotwell, Polemarch; Richard Crockett, 1st Vice Polemarch; Attorney Byron Potts; Dr. Gus Parker; and Board of Directors Nathaniel Jordan for being men who understand, if we are going to stop the school-to-prison pipeline, we need to look at our own districts. A young man asked them why he should stay in school, and they replied: Young man, you are your own future. We are relying on you to be a law-abiding citizen, educated, self-sufficient, and a good citizen because we don't want you to be a statistic in the school-to-prison pipeline. Mr. Speaker, tonight you will hear many stories, you will hear facts, and you will hear about legislation. Let me end by saying that I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Safe, Accountable, Fair, Effective (SAFE) Justice Reinvestment Act of 2015, H.R. 2944, a bill that recognizes the importance of mentoring and reducing recidivism and helps offenders think through the decisions that confront them when they leave prison. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), our chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, a person who has a long background in being an advocate and a fighter for those who are in our communities and faced with many of the things that you are going to hear tonight. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Beatty for yielding, thank her for her friendship, and thank her for all that she does not just for the Congressional Black Caucus, but for all that she does for the constituents that she represents back in Ohio and for what she does for all people in America. Let me also thank Congressman Jeffries for his great work and his willingness to participate in these Special Order hours. I know that the evening is late sometimes, but the two of them come to the floor and work very hard. I want to spend my few minutes, if I may, Mr. Speaker, talking about just an overview of the criminal justice system. There is no question that the criminal justice system is broken. All of us I think can agree on that. Those on the left and those on the right, all of us even, for different reasons, perhaps, come to one conclusion, that the criminal justice system is in need of serious, serious reform. I know that we are debating legislation here in the House regarding reforming the criminal justice system. Our colleagues over in the Senate are doing the same. But it is time for action. It is time for action on criminal justice reform in the 114th Congress. As many of my colleagues know, I spent 30 years, 30 long years, in a courtroom, half of those as a lawyer, the other half as a judge. Most of the 15 years as a judge I was a trial judge, which meant that I was on the front line in our criminal justice system and I saw it firsthand. I can tell you without question that the criminal justice system in America is in need of serious reform from the top to the bottom. [[Page H2420]] We have all heard the statistics, and I am going to repeat them again tonight: 2.2 million Americans are in prison. Of that number, that number is disproportionately African American. That is 25 percent of the world's prison population right here in the United States of America. Just think about that, Mr. Speaker. We are 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of those who are incarcerated are incarcerated in the United States of America. We have a serious problem of mass incarceration that must be reduced. But the point that I want to put in the Record tonight is that, of those who are incarcerated in this country, 90 percent of those are incarcerated at the State level and 10 percent incarcerated at the Federal level--90 percent incarcerated at the State level. {time} 1930 When we discuss criminal justice reform--and Congressman Bobby Scott is going to be speaking in a few minutes, and he talks about this all of the time, as well as Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee--we must not only talk about reform at the Federal level, but we must find ways to require States to reform their criminal justice systems at the local level. We should encourage States to take a serious look at their systems and to seek ways to reduce mass incarceration at the State level without posing any harm to the communities. Too many of those who are incarcerated at the State level are in prison for drug-related offenses and crimes that don't endanger the community whatsoever. We should encourage States to enact expungement laws. We get telephone calls all the time--and I am sure my colleagues get the same calls as well--from those who are seeking ways to expunge their records so that young men and women who have served in the criminal justice system can get some of those offenses removed from their records, particularly those offenses that deal with petty crimes and misdemeanors and drug-related offenses, because when you have these offenses on your criminal record, it prevents young people from getting the gainful employment that they so richly deserve. We also need to encourage States to look at ways to remove criminal charges from criminal records that did not result in convictions. I think most of my colleagues can relate to that. We know that, so often, police officers at the local level will charge a young offender with multiple offenses at the time of arrest, and some of the offenses are not even deserving of a charge. Sometimes police have a tendency to overcharge at the time of arrest. Then when the case finally goes to court, those 10 or 12 charges are reduced down to one charge or two charges; the defendant pleads guilty; and the case is disposed of while the other 8 or 10 charges that are dismissed continue to be on the young person's criminal record for a lifetime. So often, just the fact that the individual has been charged with a crime prevents that young person from getting a job. So often, it makes a difference. Finally, I thank Mrs. Beatty for talking about using the court system to punish students. That happens. It happens in every State in America. Our public school systems cannot, and should not, use the court system as a means of punishment for students who have behavioral problems in school. I thank all of my colleagues for all of their work. I thank them for their efforts. I thank them for their tremendous interest in this subject because it is real. We know it. We need criminal justice reform, and we need it now. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank Congressman Butterfield. We certainly agree with you that the criminal justice system is broken. That is why the Congressional Black Caucus is here tonight--to make sure that we are prepared to outline the steps and the legislation that is going to be in the forefront. I thank the gentleman for his leadership in making this a top priority for the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentleman from the Third Congressional District of Virginia. He is a true scholar, an attorney, and someone who is a leader on tonight's topic. He is someone who has worked tirelessly to make sure that we do more than just come and stand and talk about this issue tonight. He comes to talk about real reform, to talk about making a difference in our broken criminal justice system. He is my friend, Congressman Bobby Scott. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlewoman. I appreciate the gentleman from New York and certainly the gentlewoman from Ohio for organizing this Special Order to discuss the need for criminal justice reform. Mr. Speaker, we have serious, fundamental problems with our criminal justice system today. For too long, policymakers have chosen to play politics with crime policy by enacting so-called tough on crime slogans and sound bites, such as three strikes and you are out, mandatory minimum sentences, and--if you get it to rhyme, apparently, it is better--if you do the adult crime, you do the adult time. As appealing as these policies sound, their impacts range from a negligible reduction in crime to actually increasing the crime rate. As a result of these policies, the United States, despite representing only 5 percent of the world's population, has 25 percent of the world's prisoners and now has the highest incarceration rate of any nation's, by far, in the world. There are 2.2 million people behind bars in this country. That is triple the number of prisoners we had just three decades ago. At over 700 persons incarcerated for every 100,000 in the population, the United States far exceeds the world's average incarceration rate of about 100 per 100,000. Recent studies have questioned the sanity of this mass incarceration. For example, the Pew Research Center on States estimates that after about 350 per 100,000, any crime reduction value begins to diminish, and at over 500 per 100,000, incarceration becomes, actually, counterproductive. As I said, our rate is now at 700 per 100,000. These counterproductive effects are created because today there are too many children who are being raised by a parent who is in prison and by too many people with felony records who are unable to find jobs. The impact of our tax dollars is also distressing. The Bureau of Prisons is consuming too much of the Department of Justice's budget, meaning that the Department has fewer and fewer resources for other programs that can actually reduce crime and enhance public safety. The tough on crime approach falls the hardest on minorities. While the incarceration rate overall in the United States is approximately 700 per 100,000, for Blacks, the incarceration rate is over 2,200 per 100,000; and in some jurisdictions, they lock up Blacks at the rate of 4,000 per 100,000--a rate 40 times the international average. The war on drugs has exacerbated this problem. Over 2,000 Federal prisoners are now serving life without parole for nonviolent drug crimes, and many more are serving unduly harsh sentences for nonviolent offenses. The racial disparities are staggering. Despite the fact that Whites engage in drug offenses at a rate equal to or often higher than that of African Americans, African Americans are incarcerated on drug charges at a rate 10 times greater than that of Whites. We all agree that there is a problem with mass incarceration. So what is the best way to solve it? When reviewing any legislative package called criminal justice reform, I think there are some key principles that we have to address. First, reform must meaningfully address the problem of mass incarceration by significantly reducing admissions to prison and shortening a prisoner's length of stay. Second, any reform must address the primary driver of the ballooning Federal prison populations, and that is mandatory minimum penalties, especially those for drug and firearm offenses. Third, we must address the disparate impact on race in the Federal criminal justice system that has resulted from the application of many neutrally worded policies and laws. Fourth, reform must address mental health and addiction issues as a public health issue and require intervention and treatment plans to resolve underlying issues that led those to be involved in the criminal justice system rather than implement so-called tough on crime, lock 'em up approaches. Everybody knows that the war on drugs [[Page H2421]] has failed. We need to address drug abuse more as a public health issue and less as a criminal justice issue. Fifth, we must provide comprehensive reentry and rehabilitation services and incentives for completing those programs that are found to actually work, with a particular focus on those with the greatest need. Finally, any legislation must be based on research and evidence, not on poll-tested slogans and sound bites or political negotiations, which are unrelated to research and evidence. How do the current proposals stack up? First, we look at the current bills that have been reported out of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees and notice that they fail to embody any of the principles. In fact, they often take the opposite approach. While these bills reduce the number of admissions and/or length of stay in some limited cases, they also create new mandatory minimums, even new mandatory minimums or mandatory consecutive enhancements. They enhance existing mandatory minimums to apply to people who would not get them under the present law, and they irrationally limit who can benefit from prospective and retroactive relief provisions. It is unknown whether there will be an overall increase or decrease in prison impact at the 10-year point after implementation, if these bills pass, compared to doing nothing. The United States Sentencing Commission has been unable to quantify the impact of the expansions or the limitations on relief. So the fact that we do not have the numbers means that we cannot determine whether these bills will have any meaningful effect on mass incarceration. Though the bills do shorten two supersized mandatory minimums, they do not eliminate any mandatory minimum. The Senate bill actually creates two new ones, and both bills create new mandatory consecutive sentencing enhancements, which must be served after any other sentence. Both bills expand mandatory minimums for drug and gun offenses by applying them to people who would not be eligible to receive them today. If the problem we are trying to address is mass incarceration, why are those in the bill to begin with? Neither of the bills will do anything to address the disparate racial impact that pervades our criminal justice system. Federal mandatory minimums, in particular those for drug and firearm offenses, have been studied and have been found to have a racially disparate impact. These bills do nothing to eliminate mandatory minimums. Even though they reduce some, they create new ones, expand others, and create new sentencing enhancements. So the bills may actually make racial disparities in sentencing even worse than they are under present law. Finally, both bills put limits on who can receive prospective and retroactive relief. If you look at the limitations, you will find that they have a racially disparate impact on minorities. On the issue of the war on drugs, both bills also fail to treat drug abuse and addiction as a public health problem. In fact, the strategy used in the bills to address heroin addiction is not a public health approach, for the bills impose mandatory additional prison time. This is not a public health, research-based approach. On the comprehensive reentry and rehabilitation services to reduce recidivism, these bills have turned science and empirical evidence upside down. They give the greatest incentives for completing the programs to those with the lowest need while categorically barring offenders with the highest risk from benefiting from the rehabilitation programs. This approach not only violates research, but it will exacerbate the current racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Mr. Speaker, there is ample research available to show what credible criminal justice reform ought to look like. For example, Texas--one of the Nation's most conservative States--recently passed criminal justice reform legislation that was based on research and evidence, and the result was a significant reduction in crime, a significant reduction in incarceration, and a savings of billions of dollars. The SAFE Justice Act--the Safe, Accountable, Fair, and Effective Justice Act--which I cosponsored with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), which the gentlewoman from Ohio pointed out that she is supporting, was based on the Texas model and includes evidence-based prevention and early intervention programs; reducing incarceration even at the State level as well as at the Federal level; comprehensive police training and funding for body cameras, drug and veterans' courts; a significant reduction in the use of mandatory minimum sentences; and rehabilitation for all of those in prison and second- chance programs for those who have been released. It has broad, bipartisan support. All of the provisions in the bill are fully paid for by reallocating the reduction in mandatory minimums, and it shows that we do not have to accept a bill that fails to conform to evidence and research. Mr. Speaker, criminal justice reform legislation ought to be consistent with the research and evidence that is readily available. From what I can tell, the bills reported out of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have nothing based in research and evidence and, sadly, seem more concerned about the politics of criminal justice reform, with little regard to actually wanting to end our Nation's addiction to mass incarceration. The SAFE Justice Act is a better evidence-based approach, which will, if enacted, reduce crime, save money, and reduce racial disparities that pervade our criminal justice system. I appreciate the gentlewoman from Ohio and the gentleman from New York for hosting tonight's Special Order. {time} 1945 Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Scott for clearly articulating to us why we cannot let our criminal justice system remain on this trajectory. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the Congresswoman from the 13th District of California. My colleague and my friend is someone who travels the world advocating for those who live in poverty, advocating for those who are incarcerated in this broken criminal justice system that we are focusing on tonight. I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I first thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for those very kind and humbling remarks. I want to thank her for her tremendous leadership and for continuing to come down here each and every week to ensure that her voice, the Congressional Black Caucus' voice, and Congressman Jeffries' voice are really put forth so that the people of our country will understand the critical issues before us and the fact that the Congressional Black Caucus is really leading on each and every issue. Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman Jeffries really have done a phenomenal job. They both have gone way beyond the call of duty, and so we thank them so much for their efforts. Make no mistake--and I think we are hearing this over and over again tonight--mass incarceration is a crisis in our country. The United States of America imprisons far more people than any other nation in the world. When African Americans are incarcerated at six times the rate of Whites, it is no surprise to me. It is no surprise that African Americans constitute nearly half of the total 2.3 million incarcerated Americans in 2008. Together, African Americans and Latinos comprise 58 percent of all prisoners in 2008, even though African Americans and Latinos make up approximately one-quarter of the United States population. While our prison population grows unchecked and is growing unchecked, we continue to criminalize our students rather than invest in their education. Right now we spend $10,500 a year to educate a child, but we spend $88,000 a year to keep a child locked up. That is unacceptable. Let me repeat that. It costs eight times more money to keep a child in jail than to educate them and prepare them for a good future. We are not just talking about a few children here. Our country incarcerates five times more children than any other nation in the world. Sadly, two-thirds of these kids will never return to school. When we lock up these children, we are essentially throwing away [[Page H2422]] the key. Instead of preparing them for a future, we are just getting them ready for a life in a cell. Now, let me be clear, from the moment many of these children are born, they are funneled into the prison pipeline. Simply put, the system is really stacked against them. For instance, one in three African American children lives in poverty today, while one in four Hispanic children lives in poverty. Mr. Speaker, while Black children represent just 18 percent of preschool enrollment, they account for nearly half of all preschool suspensions. Now, Congresswoman Beatty, we are talking toddlers ages 2 to 5. These kids don't even get a start, let alone a head start. They are being suspended from school. How do you suspend toddlers and babies from school? Something is wrong with this. So we, I must say, in the Appropriations Committee are trying to address this with the Department of Education. This is immoral. When they get older, African American students are four times more likely to be expelled from school than their White peers for the same offense. More than half of all students who are involved in school- related arrests or referred to law enforcement are Black or Latino. This has a lasting effect and impact on young students. Studies show that students who are disciplined by schools are more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system where their chances of returning to school are slim to none. This is unacceptable. These young people are having their futures ripped away before they even have a chance. We need to change the system and end the school-to-prison pipeline. First, we must start by making serious investments in our young people. We should ensure that all students have equal access to high-quality public school education. We must also expand summer youth job opportunities and summer training programs so that our teens have the opportunity to learn workforce skills, contribute to their communities, and start a path to economic opportunity. As a member of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, we are working to try to make sure that these resources become a priority of our subcommittee, which they, unfortunately, aren't at this point. We also need to tear down the institutional racism, quite frankly, that is holding students of color back and trapping our young people in a broken criminal justice system. I am reminded of when I was in the California legislature. I was on the public safety committee, and proposals were brought to us, plans for building prisons 10 to 12 years out for kids who are just starting kindergarten. That is what we had to deal with. Now we see what has happened to the prison industrial complex in California. That is why we must work together and pass legislation to end mass incarceration and fix our broken criminal justice system. We need to get rid of these outdated minimum sentencing standards. These are relics from the failed war on drugs and disproportionately target people of color. In California, once again, the three strikes law passed. Of course, I opposed that while in the California legislature. This law has incarcerated young African American men for nonviolent drug offenses 25 years to life. That is 25 years to life for nonviolent drug offenses. We need to repeal that law. We also need to make sure that law enforcement officers reflect the diversity of communities that they police. So we have introduced H. Res. 262, which supports effective community-oriented policing and encourages greater diversity in law enforcement. During the last appropriation season, the Congressional Black Caucus worked with Congressman Lacy Clay to direct the Department of Justice to begin collecting training data. Our legislation tracks when officers receive training for use of force, racial and ethnic bias, de- escalation of conflict, and constructive engagement with the public. This was just a small step, and we need to do more. With regard to reentry, banning the box is essential. We have worked with the White House to try to make sure that Federal contractors ban the box. We haven't accomplished that, but Federal agencies cannot now ask for one's criminal history records. In my district, we do expungement, we do record remedies. We have remedied thousands and thousands of young people who now can go on and move forward with their lives. I want to thank the Family Law Center in Oakland, California, for doing that. We need to go back to the drawing board and repeal the welfare reform provisions that are denied for life. There is a Federal ban for food stamps, eligibility for public housing, and Pell grants for those who have been incarcerated for drug felonies. Now, you know who that targets; primarily African American and Latino men. They don't even have a second chance when they get out of jail as a result of these lifetime bans. Finally, let me just say it is time to really look at this problem in a big way and to understand that we have to dismantle, not reform--but we have to dismantle this prison industrial complex and start investing in our communities, especially our young children. And we must understand that, in doing this, we have to look at institutional and systemic racism, which is at the core of many of our policies. So this is a fight that we are going to win, but it is going to be because all of us here in the Congressional Black Caucus--Congresswoman Beatty, Congressman Jeffries, Congressman Scott, and Congresswoman Jackson Lee, and the entire membership--continue to fight the good fight to make sure that finally we will begin to see a real criminal justice system, which it is not right now. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lee. When people ask us why are we doing this today, I thank the gentlewoman for reminding us that the system is stacked against us and that we have had the future of so many of our young folks ripped away from them. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of Ohio (Ms. Fudge). She is from the 11th Congressional District. She is an attorney. She has served as a former mayor. She is the immediate past chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. She is someone who gives us advice. I remember her saying to us: Push the envelope because you are the voice for the voiceless. Look at the legislative issues that will make a difference in the lives of others. So tonight we come to talk about equal justice under the law. Mr. Speaker, we come to challenge this House. It is my great honor to yield to Congresswoman Marcia Fudge. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. It is a pleasure to watch my fellow Ohioan and friend and the gentleman from New York on this House floor every Monday night bringing the message of the Congressional Black Caucus because indeed they are the people who carry our message to the United States. Mr. Speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is robbing far too many children of productive futures. Instead of learning in classrooms, a large percentage of our Nation's at-risk students sit in jail cells. The numbers don't lie. Black students are suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater than White students. More than one in four boys of color with disabilities and nearly one in five girls of color with disabilities receives an out-of-school suspension. And studies show that students who are suspended or expelled in school are more likely to end up in prison. Our Nation's children deserve better. It is time we prioritize education and not incarceration. Comprehensive criminal justice reform must include policies which dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline. We must reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, a bill that funds delinquency prevention and improvements in State and local juvenile justice programs, supports restorative initiatives, and promotes early intervention. Disrupting the pipeline will provide a pathway for a successful future and lessen the burden on our current judicial system. The number of people incarcerated in America quadrupled between 1980 and 2008. Of the more than 2.3 million Americans incarcerated today, more than 1 million of them are Black. In my home State of Ohio, more than 50,000 people are incarcerated in a system that was designed to only hold [[Page H2423]] 39,000. And on average, States across this Nation spend $30,000 per year to house one inmate. That is at least $19,000 more per year than we spend to educate one child. It is time we get our priorities straight. As ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, promoting policies that keep our children in school is one of my top priorities. I ask my colleagues: What are yours? Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Fudge for reminding us again of the value and the importance of our work. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is indeed my honor to yield time to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), who is coanchor of tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. As I said earlier, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries is not only a scholar, he, too, is an attorney. He is someone who walks the talk. He is someone who has a long history of being a Brother's Keeper. Mr. Speaker, so tonight, when we discuss this topic, when we talked about the challenge, when we talked about all of the plethora of things that are incorporated in why we must come forward tonight to challenge the criminal justice system which is stacked against us and broken, certainly we have heard the disparities as it relates to African Americans. So it is indeed my honor to ask my coanchor, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, to share with us our challenge. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio, my good friend, the distinguished and dynamic anchor for tonight's Special Order, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, for yielding and for her continued leadership and for leading the discussion on the House floor today as it relates the urgency of this Congress and America dealing with the school-to-prison pipeline mass incarceration and the prison industrial complex that so many of my colleagues have explained and exposed here on the House floor today. A few years ago I had a conversation that has always stuck with me in the area of criminal justice when I was speaking to a formally incarcerated individual who spent several years behind bars incarcerated in a New York State penitentiary. He has turned his life around and he is now an advocate for criminal justice reform. He said to me on his final day, after being imprisoned for years in upstate New York, that he had a conversation with a high-ranking corrections officer, a supervisor who he had gotten to know and thought he had befriended to some degree during his time of incarceration. {time} 2000 On that last day, he said to this young African American incarcerated individual who was on his way out, he said: I just want to thank you. This gentleman was a little perplexed. He wasn't sure what he was talking about. He said: I just want to thank you for helping me to get my boat; and beyond that, I want to thank your son, who is going to help my son get his boat as well. That conversation has really haunted me because, in such a powerful and profound way, what it captures is the essence of what the prison industrial complex represents, which is this decision that was made in so many parts of the United States of America, certainly in New York, by Democrats and Republicans. When the automobile factories and the steel mills, the manufacturing plants began to close in the 1970s and in the 1980s, devastating parts of the upstate economy, a decision was made in place of those factory jobs to build prisons in their place as a means of economic development for depressed upstate communities. But here is the problem. If you build it, someone has got to fill those prisons. In order to fill those prisons, several things have developed which we are in the process of trying to dismantle right now: the school-to-prison pipeline and the criminalization of young people, particularly in communities of color, where they basically are not given a chance from the very beginning. As a result of being channeled unjustly, often, into the criminal justice system at an early age, they essentially become economic commodities for those who have come to rely on prisons to replace the factory and manufacturing jobs that have left the United States of America. That has been a big problem in New York. It is a problem in other parts of the country. It is a shame here in the United States of America that we have gone from a place where, when the war on drugs began in 1971--President Nixon declared drug abuse public enemy number one--there were less than 350,000 people incarcerated in America. Even when the crime bill that is being heavily debated in the public domain right now was passed in 1994, at the height of the concern about crime here in the United States of America, the incarcerated population was still under 900,000 people. But we have gone from less than 350,000 in 1971 to under 900,000 in 1994 to more than 2.2 million in 2016. The United States has 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's incarcerated individuals. We incarcerate more people than any other country in the world, and it is shameful. The school-to-prison pipeline is a large part of that dynamic, along with the failed war on drugs. So we are going to have to deal with this situation in a meaningful way. The statistics clearly show that, if you suspend a young person, that individual--often a Black or Latino boy--is less likely to graduate and complete school and more likely to become entangled in the criminal justice system because we have applied an overly punitive approach to discipline, particularly in the inner city. Now, in this Chamber, I have seen surprising levels of compassion as it relates to dealing with the heroin and opioid crisis that is sweeping across America right now, and I am glad that folks have decided to take a different approach than the approach that was taken in the 1980s with the crack cocaine epidemic that was sweeping across communities that those of us in the Congressional Black Caucus represent. I welcome this newfound compassion. I just hope that you would extend it now not just to the manner in which we deal with the heroin crisis-- that is important--but let's extend it to the overcriminalization that is taking place as relates to young people across America, particularly in Black and Brown communities. I am glad that we have become enlightened as it relates to moving away from punishment and toward prevention and intervention related to the heroin and opioid crisis. Let's also become enlightened in terms of dealing with breaking the school-to-prison pipeline. We will have more to say as we move forward with this discussion, but I know there are other Members who would like to contribute to this hour of power that Representative Joyce Beatty has brought to the House floor in connection with the CBC Special Order. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jeffries for reminding us that the United States makes up less than 5 percent of the world's population, yet incarcerates nearly a quarter of the global prison population. Thank you for also being on point and reminding us, Mr. Speaker, if we are to reform America's criminal justice system and advance efforts to break the cycles of incarceration in African American communities, in low-income communities, then we must unite and make sure that we pass real legislation. Mr. Speaker, can you advise me how much time we have left, please. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Ohio has 12 minutes remaining. Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is indeed my honor to yield to the gentlewoman who hails from the 18th Congressional District of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Of the many things that this Congresswoman does, she serves on the Committee on the Judiciary, she has been a longtime advocate for reforming the criminal justice system. I refer to her as a strong voice, a strong advocate, and, truly, a scholar. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to add my appreciation to the gentlewoman from Ohio; the gentleman from New York; and the Members who [[Page H2424]] have spoken, including the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Butterfield; the former chair, Ms. Fudge; and the ranking member on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, Mr. Scott. There could not be a more important topic than the topic that we are speaking about tonight. There are moments in history that I think come at times when urgency is the call of the day. It is often said that Dr. King emphasized in his tenure the urgency of moving forward on civil rights and spoke eloquently about the fact of why we cannot wait. If I might, I want to capture his theme of why we cannot wait to end the school-to-prison pipeline. End it now and begin the whole comprehensive approach of criminal justice reform. Let me take Texas as an example and cite some very important statistics from the Appleseed Report and as well a comment on the work that we are doing in the Committee on the Judiciary. I am so glad at this moment in history to be the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations and working with the members of my subcommittee, including Mr. Jeffries, who is a member, Ms. Bass, who is a member, and a number of other members as well, on this very difficult hurdle that we have. Let it be very clear that this hurdle of criminal justice reform is, as I heard Mr. Jeffries make mention of, that we have taken hold of this issue of opioids and heroin in a way that not one single bill was passed last week that had a criminal focus, particularly out of the Committee on the Judiciary. Not one bill had mandatory minimums. In the debate last week, on Friday, I reiterated over and over again no mandatory minimums in this legislation. That should be the perfect that we try to achieve going forward on criminal justice reform. But let me give the beginnings of that very tragic outcome in America, filling up the Nation's prisons, not having criminal justice but criminal unfairness. It starts with a path to incarceration, which includes in the schools, stops, failing public schools, zero tolerance and other school discipline, police in school hallways, disciplinary alternative schools, and court involvement in juvenile detention. All of these are a path for students to incarceration, and it is without understanding what a class C misdemeanor ticket and a trip to court for thousands of Texas students and their families means. Texas students as young as 6 have been ticketed at school in past years, and it is not uncommon for elementary school students to be ticketed by school-based law enforcement. School-based arrest of students often occurs without prior notice to parents. Police officers in some Texas schools are resorting to use of force, measures more commonly associated with fighting street crime: pepper spray, tasers, and trained canines when a schoolyard fight breaks out or when students are misbehaving in a cafeteria or at a school event. This should not be the picture for a 6-year-old or a 4-year-old or an 8-year-old or an 11-year-old or a 13-year-old. This should not be equated with school. Let me read to you part of the Appleseed Report and a quote by Ryan Kellus Turner and Mark Goodner: ``In a little over two decades, a paradigm shift has occurred in the Lone Star State. The misdeeds of children--acts that in the near recent past resulted in trips to the principal's office, corporal punishment, or extra laps under the supervision of a middle school or high school coach . . . '' Now, of course, corporal punishment will be eliminated from that. What is worse, `` . . . now result in criminal prosecution, criminal records, and untold millions of dollars in punitive fines and hefty court costs being imposed against children ages 10 through 16.'' ``It is conservatively estimated that more than 275,000 non-traffic tickets are issued to juveniles in Texas each year . . . '' And based on the information from the Texas Office of Court Administration, the number of non-traffic tickets issued to students may well grossly exceed that number because it was very difficult to get it. ``Texas can interrupt this destructive cycle and prevent the loss of more young people to the `school-to-prison pipeline' through early interventions focused less on punishment and more on creating positive school environments that address students' academic and behavioral needs.'' Let me just say that ``police officers in some Texas schools are resorting to `use of force.' '' Now, they are supposed to be there as SROs. SROs are supposed to have educational training. SROs are supposed to be able to have the understanding of how to deal with counseling issues and teaching that is evidence based, but here is the problem. The problem is that they are focused more on law enforcement. I am glad to be part of this Special Order tonight that deals with the pipeline that has started working our children toward incarceration: overcrowded schools, lack of qualified teachers, inadequate resources, and then the zero tolerance for school discipline of children and the rate of suspension having increased dramatically in recent years from 1.7 million in 1974 to 3.1 million in 2000; and it has gone beyond that, and the greatest emphasis has been on children of color. So here is my call to the United States Congress. We have to begin the process of dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline. We have to understand that children can learn. No child is a throwaway. I offer that often in my remarks in my district. The detention system is an unfair system. I don't know how many of you realize that when a child is sent to juvie, that child can remain there until they reach the age of 21. How does that happen? Even if their sentence is not as egregious as one might think--a simple misbehavior in school. The way that happens is because in juvenile, you can assess more time on a child without telling that child's parent because that child did not follow orders or, in essence, that child did not behave or that child chewed gum when you told them not to. {time} 2015 We in the Judiciary Committee are working on juvenile justice reform. One of them that I am most concerned about and want to move is ending solitary confinement for juveniles, recognizing Kalief's Law, involving the death of one inside the New York prison at Rikers Island. The individual in solitary confinement had not been rendered guilty yet. And so we want to eliminate putting juveniles in solitary confinement. Because the tragedy, Mr. Speaker, was that that youngster was released, ultimately, but after he was released, he, in essence, committed suicide. So I want to close my remarks by indicating that I want to turn this system upside down. I want to make sure that we deal with juvenile justice reform. I want to ban the box. We have done that in legislation that has not yet passed. I want to make sure that we have alternative sentencing. At the same time, the Judiciary Committee has moved two bills out of committee. I want to see these bills have a vigorous discussion and debate on the floor of the House so that we can move to conference. Time is going by. Let us not let the perfect be, in essence, the downfall of change. H.R. 3713 provides for the reduction of sentencing for many who are languishing, by law, in prison today in the Federal system. As I have spoken to people across the country, they have indicated that, even though some States like my State of Texas have made enormous, enormous strides--I am proud of that--it has not happened around the country. The bully pulpit of the Federal Government can be the most effective tool to moving toward criminal justice reform and sentencing reduction dealing with felony drug offenses. We are moving toward that point. A vote on the floor of the House and moving toward conference can move our efforts toward legislation that can truly be responsive to both concerns and as well positives that are in that bill. So as we deal with this prison pipeline, we have to not only talk, we have to do. And when we do, we have to make sure that we respond to the concerns, but we also have to make sure that we move legislation that can ultimately come out of the Senate and go to conference and make a difference in the lives of so many. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio. I also want to say how [[Page H2425]] timely the Congressional Black Caucus is. All that have been crying out, from Black Lives Matter to the Mother of the Movement, say that we need changes dealing with the whole vastness of criminal justice reform: police-community relations, police actions, actions dealing with guns, actions dealing with the loss of life of our young people. Let's get a framework that can allow us to debate, to fix, to amend, and to get a product that will ultimately be signed by the President of the United States on behalf of the people of the United States who are crying out for relief. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) who are anchoring this Special Order on Ending the School-to-Prison Pipeline. The over-criminalization of school children in America can no longer be swept under the rug, ignored or irrationally justified. We are in a state of national crisis and it is time to act. Upon taking office, every Member of Congress makes a solemn pledge: to protect and defend the American people. This is the most important oath we take as elected officials--and, to honor this promise, we must do everything in our power to stem the School-to-Prison Pipeline in our nation. The three most important concerns for Members of Congress today are No. 1 Children, No. 2 Children, and No. 3 Children. House Republicans are still unwilling to act to stop the criminalization of our children in schools and instead work towards providing children the opportunity to thrive in American communities. This Congress has a moral obligation to do our part to end the epidemic of losing our children to the correctional system. Now is the time for Republicans to join Democrats in protecting the lives of America's youth by taking common sense steps in redirecting those who go astray. Over the past year, several proposals have been introduced to address the need for overarching reform of our nation's criminal justice system. Americans must consider the educational environment in which we place our students, from preschool to high school, subjecting them to disciplinary policies that more closely resemble policing than teaching. Around the country, advocates are collecting data illustrating the devastating effects of what they call the ``school-to-prison pipeline,'' where student behavior is criminalized, children are treated like prisoners and, all too often, actually end up behind bars. The school-to-prison pipeline refers to interlocking sets of relationships at the institutional/structural and the individual levels. All of these policies and practices work together to push our nation's schoolchildren--youth of color, especially, our most at-risk children--out of schools and into unemployment and into the juvenile and criminal justice legal systems. This pipeline reflects the prioritization of incarceration over education. For a growing number of students, the path to incarceration includes the ``stops'' deterring matriculation such as: 1) Failing Public Schools; 2) Zero-Tolerance and Other School Discipline; 3) Policing School Hallways; 4) Disciplinary Alternative Schools; and 5) Court Involvement and Juvenile Detention. In a little over two decades, a paradigm shift has occurred in the Lone Star State. The misdeeds of children--acts that in the near recent past resulted in trips to the principal's office, corporal punishment, or extra laps under the supervision of a middle school or high school coach, now result in criminal prosecution, criminal records, and untold millions of dollars in punitive fines and hefty court costs being imposed against children in elementary and high schools. Disrupting class, using profanity, misbehaving on a school bus, student fights, and truancy once meant a trip to the principal's office. Today, such misbehavior results in a Class C misdemeanor ticket and a trip to court for thousands of Texas students and their families each year. It is conservatively estimated that more than 275,000 non-traffic tickets are issued to juveniles in Texas each year. While it is impossible to pinpoint how many of these tickets are issued by campus police, the vast majority of these tickets are issued for offenses most commonly linked to school-related misbehavior-- disruption of class, disorderly conduct, disruption of transportation, truancy, and simple assaults related to student fights. ``Criminalization'' of student misbehavior extends to even the youngest students. In Texas, students as young as six have been ticketed at school in the past five years, and it is not uncommon for elementary-school students to be ticketed by school-based law enforcement. School-based arrest of students often occurs without prior notice to parents or a lawyer being present during initial questioning of the student. The increase in ticketing and arrest of students, in Texas and nationwide, has coincided with the growth in school-based policing. Campus policing is the largest and fastest growing area of law enforcement in Texas, according to its own professional association. With counselors stretched to handle class scheduling and test administration duties, school administrators and teachers are increasingly turning to campus police officers to handle student behavior problems. Today in Texas, most public schools have a police officer assigned to patrol hallways, lunchrooms, school grounds, and after-school events. Police officers in some Texas schools are resorting to ``use of force'' measures more commonly associated with fighting street crime-- pepper spray, Tasers and trained canines--when a schoolyard fight breaks out or when students are misbehaving in a cafeteria or at a school event. The intent is to keep schools and students safe, but there can be unintended consequences to disciplining public school students in a way that introduces them to the justice system or exposes them to policing techniques more commonly used with adults. Texas can interrupt this destructive cycle and prevent the loss of more young people to the ``school-to-prison pipeline'' through early interventions focused less on punishment and more on creating positive school environments that address students' academic and behavioral needs. We must seek appropriate recommendations for reform. For most students, the pipeline begins with inadequate resources in public schools. Overcrowded classrooms, a lack of qualified teachers, and insufficient funding for ``extras'' such as counselors, special education services, and even textbooks, lock students into second-rate educational environments. This failure to meet educational needs increases disengagement and dropouts, increasing the risk of later court involvement. Even worse, schools may actually encourage dropouts in response to pressures from test-based accountability regimes such as the No Child Left Behind Act, which create incentives to push out low-performing students to boost overall test scores. Lacking resources, facing incentives to push out low-performing students, and responding to a handful of highly-publicized school shootings, schools have embraced zero-tolerance policies that automatically impose severe punishment regardless of circumstances. Under these policies, students have been expelled for bringing nail clippers or scissors to school. Rates of suspension have increased dramatically in recent years--from 1.7 million in 1974 to 3.1 million in 2000--and have been most dramatic for children of color. Overly harsh disciplinary policies push students down the pipeline and into the juvenile justice system. Suspended and expelled children are often left unsupervised and without constructive activities. They also can easily fall behind in their coursework, leading to a greater likelihood of disengagement and drop-outs. All of these factors increase the likelihood of court involvement. As harsh penalties for minor misbehavior become more pervasive, schools increasingly ignore or bypass due process protections for suspensions and expulsions. The lack of due process is particularly acute for students with special needs, who are disproportionately represented in the pipeline despite the heightened protections afforded to them under law. Many under-resourced schools become ``pipeline gateways'' by placing increased reliance on police rather than teachers and administrators to maintain discipline. Growing numbers of districts employ school resource officers to patrol school hallways, often with little or no training in working with youth. As a result, children are far more likely to be subject to school- based arrests--the majority of which are for non-violent offenses, such as disruptive behavior--than they were a generation ago. The rise in school-based arrests, the quickest route from the classroom to the jailhouse, most directly exemplifies the criminalization of school children. In some jurisdictions, students who have been suspended or expelled have been completely denied their right to an education. In others, they are sent to disciplinary alternative schools. [[Page H2426]] Growing in number across the country, these shadow systems--sometimes run by private, for-profit companies--are immune from educational accountability standards (such as minimum classroom hours and curriculum requirements) and may fail to provide meaningful educational services to the students who need them the most. As a result, struggling students return to their regular schools unprepared, are permanently locked into inferior educational settings, or are funneled through alternative schools into the juvenile justice system. Youth who become involved in the juvenile justice system are often denied procedural protections in the courts. Studies demonstrate that as many as 80 percent of court-involved children do not have lawyers. Students who commit minor offenses may end up in secured detention if they violate boilerplate probation conditions prohibiting them from activities like missing school or disobeying teachers. Students pushed along the pipeline find themselves in juvenile detention facilities, many of which provide few, if any, educational services. Students of color, who are far more likely than their white peers to be suspended, expelled, or arrested for the same kind of conduct at school, and those with disabilities are particularly likely to travel down this pipeline. Though many students are propelled down the pipeline from school to jail, it is difficult for them to make the journey in reverse. Students who enter the juvenile justice system face many barriers to their re-entry into traditional schools. The vast majority of these students never graduate from high school. Numerous studies have also shown that as many as 70-80 percent of youth involved in the justice system meet the criteria for a disability. We must move away from the engrained culture of criminalization as the answer to our problems. It is no secret that 1 in every 3 black males born today can expect to go to prison at some point in their life, compared with 1 in every 6 Latino males, and 1 in every 17 white males. It is a statistic we know well because it is one that has been reported since 2001 and has remained unchanged for nearly 15 years. It is time we stop repeating and start understanding and unraveling the fateful 1 in 3 trend that continues to sweep entire generations of young men of color into a lifetime of systematic and barriers. The United States currently has the largest number of prisoners in the world due to its skyrocketing national imprisonment rate. Rather than investing in premier educational responses, the United States pays the highest cost globally for incarceration. Federal, state, and local leaders are looking for innovative ways to improve public health and public safety outcomes, while reducing the costs of criminal justice and corrections. A number of innovative strategies can save public funds and improve public health by keeping low-risk, non-violent, drug-involved offenders out of prison or jail, while still holding them accountable and ensuring the safety of our communities. The Obama Administration is committed to funding and evaluating the long-term effects of these innovative criminal justice and corrections interventions. I too call upon my colleagues to come together and pass legislation that will help stop the derailment of children's lives. Meanwhile, Federal agencies will continue to seek opportunities to expand smart probation and problem-solving court initiatives around the country in collaboration with state, local, and tribal agencies. In recognition of the considerable potential in cost savings, improved outcomes for offenders, and improved public safety, a growing number of state and local officials around the country are starting their own promising initiatives to break the cycle of drug use, crime, and incarceration. Nearly every state is struggling with significant shortfalls in revenue and making significant cuts to spending in order to close budget gaps. In making these cuts, many states are focusing attention on corrections spending, one of the fastest growing lines in state budgets over the past two decades. Many states are pursuing a justice reinvestment approach, using data to determine what has been driving the growth in the prison population and how that growth might be stopped. In addition, small investments have been made in programs designed to reduce recidivism. New policies have been enacted, slowing the growth of prison populations or even downsizing corrections systems, saving states hundreds of millions of dollars. A portion of those savings are being reinvested in community-based services and supports, including substance abuse treatment. However, to have meaningful impact on behaviors that contribute to crime, recidivism, and substance abuse, states must focus on a handful of proven strategies that will maximize the impact of limited investments being made in the treatment of substance use disorders and community supervision. I am a strong supporter of education and I am particularly sensitive and protective of measures to keep students safe in school. In this same spirit, we must invest in a multi-step, collaborative process that involves the combined efforts of law enforcement, prosecutors, influential community members, social services, reentry services, community corrections, faith-based organizations, and city management. We have seen too often the horrific abuses of school officers dragging, punching, slapping, and more to students. First and foremost school-based law enforcement personnel need to be removed from the educational setting. And if law enforcement are not removed, they should be required to receive post-certification training in issues specific to youth, including: 1) de-escalation and mediation techniques; 2) restraint techniques to be used when force cannot be avoided; 3) signs and symptoms of trauma, abuse and neglect in children and youth, as well as appropriate responses; 4) signs and symptoms of mental illness in children and youth, and appropriate responses; and 5) manifestations of other disabilities, such as autism, and appropriate responses, adolescent development, Juvenile law, and Special education and applicable general education law. Prohibit school districts from receiving any revenue from Class C ticketing for truancy or any other offense. Eliminate Disruption of Class and Disruption of Transportation as penal code offenses. Prohibit ticketing of students under the age of 14. Young children are simply not equipped to understand a Class C misdemeanor ticket as a meaningful consequence of misbehavior, and the consequences of court involvement on academic success are too great to allow this practice to continue. Ticketing of older students should be a last resort. Ticketing, arrest and use of force in schools is preposterously reshaping today's school disciplinary policies disproportionately to actual need. We must acknowledge this epidemic and move to correct the inevitable injustice that follows when our children are derailed from their futures. I thank my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) for hosting this Special Order on Ending the School-to-Prison Pipeline. It is an invaluable and much needed effort. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, let me just end by saying that the urgency is now. In the words of Nelson Mandela, ``It always seems impossible until it's done.'' Tonight the Congressional Black Caucus says: Let's get it done. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, our children represent the future of our nation. Our future is more promising when our children have a clear path to succeed and have the opportunities to become active members of the community. Over time, a culture of favoring incarceration over education has become more prominent throughout our society--particularly as it relates to minority and low- income populations. Financial shortfalls at all levels of government are also placing downward pressure on states and municipalities to cut back on public services and educational or community-based programs in favor of harsh criminalization or incarceration. The result is the ``school-to-prison pipeline,'' which poses a very real threat to our children and our society. This pipeline refers to harsh policies and practices that cultivate a culture where young individuals are pushed into the juvenile and criminal justice systems through harsh punishments in schools. Inadequate resources in public schools, economic instability, zero-tolerance policies, and harsh punishments for non-violent offenses are all contributing to the school-to-prison pipeline. As a result, the United States suffers from the largest number of prisoners in the world and the economic and social burden of the high costs of incarceration. Zero tolerance policies are dangerous to have in our schools. These policies impose extremely severe punishments on students, regardless of the circumstances, which can result in suspension or even expulsion from school. Children of color and students with special needs have experienced a dramatic increase in these suspensions and expulsions, which greatly increase their probability of entering into the juvenile justice system. Schools [[Page H2427]] are also beginning to display an overreliance on law enforcement to maintain discipline through the use of school resource officers. Mr. Speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is the result of a dangerous precedent being set in our schools. Zero tolerance policies and the overreliance on law enforcement to keep order in our schools not only detracts from the culture of learning we expect in our schools, but also condemns countless children to a life of suffering for making simple mistakes during their youth. Our society will suffer if we continue on this path of forcing children into the criminal justice system and it is time that we considered serious reforms to keep children in our communities and outside the juvenile justice system. ____________________",package_114_176.csv,69383,69383,69448,"[congressional record volume 162, number 77 (monday, may 16, 2016)] [house] [pages h2418-h2427] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] congressional black caucus the speaker pro tempore (mr. bost). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from ohio (mrs. beatty) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. general leave mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members [[page h2419]] may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous material relevant to the subject matter of my special order. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from ohio? there was no objection. mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, i rise this evening as co-anchor along with my classmate and scholar, congressman hakeem jeffries, from the eighth district of new york, for tonight's congressional black caucus special order hour, equal justice under the law: criminal justice reform and challenging the school-to-prison pipeline. congressman jeffries leads by example. he is a member of the criminal justice task force, and he has a long personal and professional history of being a brother's keeper. this evening the congressional black caucus comes to the house floor to discuss the current state of america's criminal justice system and the necessary reform, reform that will allow us to invest in our communities and expand opportunities for all americans. mr. speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is an epidemic that is plaguing schools across the nation. mr. speaker, the need and appetite to reform our federal criminal justice system has been building for years, and now it is clear that there is consensus that the time is now to take meaningful action. the school-to-prison pipeline refers to the policies and practices that pushes our nation's children, especially our most at-risk children, out of the classroom and into the juvenile and criminal justice system. far too often, students are expended, expelled, or even arrested for minor offenses that lead to visits to the principal's office a thing of the past. statistics reflect that these policies disproportionately target students of color and those with a history of abuse, neglect, poverty, or learning disabilities. those who are unnecessarily forced out of school become stigmatized and fall behind in their studies, mr. speaker. many eventually decide to drop out of school altogether, and many others commit crimes in their community. former u.s. attorney general eric holder discussed the issue in a speech to the american bar association in 2013, stating that rigid discipline policies transformed too many educational institutions from the doorway of opportunity into the gateway to the criminal justice system and that a minor school disciplinary offense should put a student in the principal's office, not in the police precinct. according to recent data by the department of education, african american students are arrested far more than their white classmates. black and hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in school-related arrests or referrals to law enforcement. currently, african americans make up two-fifths of combined youth today, mr. speaker. in my home state of ohio, the impact of suspensions and expulsions on communities is striking. in ohio, a history of prior suspensions from school is the number one factor that leads children to dropping out of school. children who do not finish high school, as we all are aware, are more likely to end up incarcerated or in our juvenile or criminal justice system and are 3.5 times more likely to be arrested. approximately 82 percent of the adult population is composed of high school dropouts. mr. speaker, unfortunately, this is a pipeline that reflects the prioritization of incarceration over education. but, mr. speaker, i come today as a member of the congressional black caucus because i believe we can disrupt the pipeline. to do this, we need to be honest about the opportunity gaps that exist across our country and in our schools because you cannot talk about the school-to-prison pipeline without discussing what needs to be provided as economic opportunities. we need better educational chances for our young people. we need more support to our families so that they can do the best job that they can or that they are capable of doing to help support their own children. we must confront prejudices in our nation head-on. that is why initiatives like the white house's my brother's keeper is so important. my brother's keeper task force is a coordinated federal effort to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. mr. speaker, lastly, this past weekend i met with the dynamic men of the columbus chapter of kappa alpha psi fraternity, incorporated, in my district and saw my brother's keeper work firsthand. i learned of their many forms of being role models, as being community mentors for at-risk students, particularly young males, who are in need of inspiration and counsel regarding their choice of a life's career. the mentoring men of kappa alpha psi fraternity, incorporated, are men who are doctors, lawyers, government officials, teachers, and entrepreneurs, just to name a few. mr. speaker, these men are role models for the community. they bought a house in my district, and they use that home as an anchor to provide opportunities and leadership development, professional networking, and positive reinforcement. tonight it is important for me to put a face on what we need to do as one small example to stop the school-to-prison pipeline. i salute philip shotwell, polemarch; richard crockett, 1st vice polemarch; attorney byron potts; dr. gus parker; and board of directors nathaniel jordan for being men who understand, if we are going to stop the school-to-prison pipeline, we need to look at our own districts. a young man asked them why he should stay in school, and they replied: young man, you are your own future. we are relying on you to be a law-abiding citizen, educated, self-sufficient, and a good citizen because we don't want you to be a statistic in the school-to-prison pipeline. mr. speaker, tonight you will hear many stories, you will hear facts, and you will hear about legislation. let me end by saying that i am proud to be a cosponsor of the safe, accountable, fair, effective (safe) justice reinvestment act of 2015, h.r. 2944, a bill that recognizes the importance of mentoring and reducing recidivism and helps offenders think through the decisions that confront them when they leave prison. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. butterfield), our chairman of the congressional black caucus, a person who has a long background in being an advocate and a fighter for those who are in our communities and faced with many of the things that you are going to hear tonight. mr. butterfield. mr. speaker, i thank congresswoman beatty for yielding, thank her for her friendship, and thank her for all that she does not just for the congressional black caucus, but for all that she does for the constituents that she represents back in ohio and for what she does for all people in america. let me also thank congressman jeffries for his great work and his willingness to participate in these special order hours. i know that the evening is late sometimes, but the two of them come to the floor and work very hard. i want to spend my few minutes, if i may, mr. speaker, talking about just an overview of the criminal justice system. there is no question that the criminal justice system is broken. all of us i think can agree on that. those on the left and those on the right, all of us even, for different reasons, perhaps, come to one conclusion, that the criminal justice system is in need of serious, serious reform. i know that we are debating legislation here in the house regarding reforming the criminal justice system. our colleagues over in the senate are doing the same. but it is time for action. it is time for action on criminal justice reform in the 114th congress. as many of my colleagues know, i spent 30 years, 30 long years, in a courtroom, half of those as a lawyer, the other half as a judge. most of the 15 years as a judge i was a trial judge, which meant that i was on the front line in our criminal justice system and i saw it firsthand. i can tell you without question that the criminal justice system in america is in need of serious reform from the top to the bottom. [[page h2420]] we have all heard the statistics, and i am going to repeat them again tonight: 2.2 million americans are in prison. of that number, that number is disproportionately african american. that is 25 percent of the world's prison population right here in the united states of america. just think about that, mr. speaker. we are 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of those who are incarcerated are incarcerated in the united states of america. we have a serious problem of mass incarceration that must be reduced. but the point that i want to put in the record tonight is that, of those who are incarcerated in this country, 90 percent of those are incarcerated at the state level and 10 percent incarcerated at the federal level--90 percent incarcerated at the state level. {time} 1930 when we discuss criminal justice reform--and congressman bobby scott is going to be speaking in a few minutes, and he talks about this all of the time, as well as congresswoman sheila jackson lee--we must not only talk about reform at the federal level, but we must find ways to require states to reform their criminal justice systems at the local level. we should encourage states to take a serious look at their systems and to seek ways to reduce mass incarceration at the state level without posing any harm to the communities. too many of those who are incarcerated at the state level are in prison for drug-related offenses and crimes that don't endanger the community whatsoever. we should encourage states to enact expungement laws. we get telephone calls all the time--and i am sure my colleagues get the same calls as well--from those who are seeking ways to expunge their records so that young men and women who have served in the criminal justice system can get some of those offenses removed from their records, particularly those offenses that deal with petty crimes and misdemeanors and drug-related offenses, because when you have these offenses on your criminal record, it prevents young people from getting the gainful employment that they so richly deserve. we also need to encourage states to look at ways to remove criminal charges from criminal records that did not result in convictions. i think most of my colleagues can relate to that. we know that, so often, police officers at the local level will charge a young offender with multiple offenses at the time of arrest, and some of the offenses are not even deserving of a charge. sometimes police have a tendency to overcharge at the time of arrest. then when the case finally goes to court, those 10 or 12 charges are reduced down to one charge or two charges; the defendant pleads guilty; and the case is disposed of while the other 8 or 10 charges that are dismissed continue to be on the young person's criminal record for a lifetime. so often, just the fact that the individual has been charged with a crime prevents that young person from getting a job. so often, it makes a difference. finally, i thank mrs. beatty for talking about using the court system to punish students. that happens. it happens in every state in america. our public school systems cannot, and should not, use the court system as a means of punishment for students who have behavioral problems in school. i thank all of my colleagues for all of their work. i thank them for their efforts. i thank them for their tremendous interest in this subject because it is real. we know it. we need criminal justice reform, and we need it now. mrs. beatty. i thank congressman butterfield. we certainly agree with you that the criminal justice system is broken. that is why the congressional black caucus is here tonight--to make sure that we are prepared to outline the steps and the legislation that is going to be in the forefront. i thank the gentleman for his leadership in making this a top priority for the congressional black caucus. mr. speaker, it is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentleman from the third congressional district of virginia. he is a true scholar, an attorney, and someone who is a leader on tonight's topic. he is someone who has worked tirelessly to make sure that we do more than just come and stand and talk about this issue tonight. he comes to talk about real reform, to talk about making a difference in our broken criminal justice system. he is my friend, congressman bobby scott. mr. scott of virginia. i thank the gentlewoman. i appreciate the gentleman from new york and certainly the gentlewoman from ohio for organizing this special order to discuss the need for criminal justice reform. mr. speaker, we have serious, fundamental problems with our criminal justice system today. for too long, policymakers have chosen to play politics with crime policy by enacting so-called tough on crime slogans and sound bites, such as three strikes and you are out, mandatory minimum sentences, and--if you get it to rhyme, apparently, it is better--if you do the adult crime, you do the adult time. as appealing as these policies sound, their impacts range from a negligible reduction in crime to actually increasing the crime rate. as a result of these policies, the united states, despite representing only 5 percent of the world's population, has 25 percent of the world's prisoners and now has the highest incarceration rate of any nation's, by far, in the world. there are 2.2 million people behind bars in this country. that is triple the number of prisoners we had just three decades ago. at over 700 persons incarcerated for every 100,000 in the population, the united states far exceeds the world's average incarceration rate of about 100 per 100,000. recent studies have questioned the sanity of this mass incarceration. for example, the pew research center on states estimates that after about 350 per 100,000, any crime reduction value begins to diminish, and at over 500 per 100,000, incarceration becomes, actually, counterproductive. as i said, our rate is now at 700 per 100,000. these counterproductive effects are created because today there are too many children who are being raised by a parent who is in prison and by too many people with felony records who are unable to find jobs. the impact of our tax dollars is also distressing. the bureau of prisons is consuming too much of the department of justice's budget, meaning that the department has fewer and fewer resources for other programs that can actually reduce crime and enhance public safety. the tough on crime approach falls the hardest on minorities. while the incarceration rate overall in the united states is approximately 700 per 100,000, for blacks, the incarceration rate is over 2,200 per 100,000; and in some jurisdictions, they lock up blacks at the rate of 4,000 per 100,000--a rate 40 times the international average. the war on drugs has exacerbated this problem. over 2,000 federal prisoners are now serving life without parole for nonviolent drug crimes, and many more are serving unduly harsh sentences for nonviolent offenses. the racial disparities are staggering. despite the fact that whites engage in drug offenses at a rate equal to or often higher than that of african americans, african americans are incarcerated on drug charges at a rate 10 times greater than that of whites. we all agree that there is a problem with mass incarceration. so what is the best way to solve it? when reviewing any legislative package called criminal justice reform, i think there are some key principles that we have to address. first, reform must meaningfully address the problem of mass incarceration by significantly reducing admissions to prison and shortening a prisoner's length of stay. second, any reform must address the primary driver of the ballooning federal prison populations, and that is mandatory minimum penalties, especially those for drug and firearm offenses. third, we must address the disparate impact on race in the federal criminal justice system that has resulted from the application of many neutrally worded policies and laws. fourth, reform must address mental health and addiction issues as a public health issue and require intervention and treatment plans to resolve underlying issues that led those to be involved in the criminal justice system rather than implement so-called tough on crime, lock 'em up approaches. everybody knows that the war on drugs [[page h2421]] has failed. we need to address drug abuse more as a public health issue and less as a criminal justice issue. fifth, we must provide comprehensive reentry and rehabilitation services and incentives for completing those programs that are found to actually work, with a particular focus on those with the greatest need. finally, any legislation must be based on research and evidence, not on poll-tested slogans and sound bites or political negotiations, which are unrelated to research and evidence. how do the current proposals stack up? first, we look at the current bills that have been reported out of the house and senate judiciary committees and notice that they fail to embody any of the principles. in fact, they often take the opposite approach. while these bills reduce the number of admissions and/or length of stay in some limited cases, they also create new mandatory minimums, even new mandatory minimums or mandatory consecutive enhancements. they enhance existing mandatory minimums to apply to people who would not get them under the present law, and they irrationally limit who can benefit from prospective and retroactive relief provisions. it is unknown whether there will be an overall increase or decrease in prison impact at the 10-year point after implementation, if these bills pass, compared to doing nothing. the united states sentencing commission has been unable to quantify the impact of the expansions or the limitations on relief. so the fact that we do not have the numbers means that we cannot determine whether these bills will have any meaningful effect on mass incarceration. though the bills do shorten two supersized mandatory minimums, they do not eliminate any mandatory minimum. the senate bill actually creates two new ones, and both bills create new mandatory consecutive sentencing enhancements, which must be served after any other sentence. both bills expand mandatory minimums for drug and gun offenses by applying them to people who would not be eligible to receive them today. if the problem we are trying to address is mass incarceration, why are those in the bill to begin with? neither of the bills will do anything to address the disparate racial impact that pervades our criminal justice system. federal mandatory minimums, in particular those for drug and firearm offenses, have been studied and have been found to have a racially disparate impact. these bills do nothing to eliminate mandatory minimums. even though they reduce some, they create new ones, expand others, and create new sentencing enhancements. so the bills may actually make racial disparities in sentencing even worse than they are under present law. finally, both bills put limits on who can receive prospective and retroactive relief. if you look at the limitations, you will find that they have a racially disparate impact on minorities. on the issue of the war on drugs, both bills also fail to treat drug abuse and addiction as a public health problem. in fact, the strategy used in the bills to address heroin addiction is not a public health approach, for the bills impose mandatory additional prison time. this is not a public health, research-based approach. on the comprehensive reentry and rehabilitation services to reduce recidivism, these bills have turned science and empirical evidence upside down. they give the greatest incentives for completing the programs to those with the lowest need while categorically barring offenders with the highest risk from benefiting from the rehabilitation programs. this approach not only violates research, but it will exacerbate the current racial disparities in the criminal justice system. mr. speaker, there is ample research available to show what credible criminal justice reform ought to look like. for example, texas--one of the nation's most conservative states--recently passed criminal justice reform legislation that was based on research and evidence, and the result was a significant reduction in crime, a significant reduction in incarceration, and a savings of billions of dollars. the safe justice act--the safe, accountable, fair, and effective justice act--which i cosponsored with the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. sensenbrenner), which the gentlewoman from ohio pointed out that she is supporting, was based on the texas model and includes evidence-based prevention and early intervention programs; reducing incarceration even at the state level as well as at the federal level; comprehensive police training and funding for body cameras, drug and veterans' courts; a significant reduction in the use of mandatory minimum sentences; and rehabilitation for all of those in prison and second- chance programs for those who have been released. it has broad, bipartisan support. all of the provisions in the bill are fully paid for by reallocating the reduction in mandatory minimums, and it shows that we do not have to accept a bill that fails to conform to evidence and research. mr. speaker, criminal justice reform legislation ought to be consistent with the research and evidence that is readily available. from what i can tell, the bills reported out of the house and senate judiciary committees have nothing based in research and evidence and, sadly, seem more concerned about the politics of criminal justice reform, with little regard to actually wanting to end our nation's addiction to mass incarceration. the safe justice act is a better evidence-based approach, which will, if enacted, reduce crime, save money, and reduce racial disparities that pervade our criminal justice system. i appreciate the gentlewoman from ohio and the gentleman from new york for hosting tonight's special order. {time} 1945 mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, i thank congressman scott for clearly articulating to us why we cannot let our criminal justice system remain on this trajectory. mr. speaker, i now yield to the congresswoman from the 13th district of california. my colleague and my friend is someone who travels the world advocating for those who live in poverty, advocating for those who are incarcerated in this broken criminal justice system that we are focusing on tonight. i yield to the gentlewoman from california (ms. lee). ms. lee. mr. speaker, i first thank the gentlewoman from ohio for those very kind and humbling remarks. i want to thank her for her tremendous leadership and for continuing to come down here each and every week to ensure that her voice, the congressional black caucus' voice, and congressman jeffries' voice are really put forth so that the people of our country will understand the critical issues before us and the fact that the congressional black caucus is really leading on each and every issue. congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries really have done a phenomenal job. they both have gone way beyond the call of duty, and so we thank them so much for their efforts. make no mistake--and i think we are hearing this over and over again tonight--mass incarceration is a crisis in our country. the united states of america imprisons far more people than any other nation in the world. when african americans are incarcerated at six times the rate of whites, it is no surprise to me. it is no surprise that african americans constitute nearly half of the total 2.3 million incarcerated americans in 2008. together, african americans and latinos comprise 58 percent of all prisoners in 2008, even though african americans and latinos make up approximately one-quarter of the united states population. while our prison population grows unchecked and is growing unchecked, we continue to criminalize our students rather than invest in their education. right now we spend $10,500 a year to educate a child, but we spend $88,000 a year to keep a child locked up. that is unacceptable. let me repeat that. it costs eight times more money to keep a child in jail than to educate them and prepare them for a good future. we are not just talking about a few children here. our country incarcerates five times more children than any other nation in the world. sadly, two-thirds of these kids will never return to school. when we lock up these children, we are essentially throwing away [[page h2422]] the key. instead of preparing them for a future, we are just getting them ready for a life in a cell. now, let me be clear, from the moment many of these children are born, they are funneled into the prison pipeline. simply put, the system is really stacked against them. for instance, one in three african american children lives in poverty today, while one in four hispanic children lives in poverty. mr. speaker, while black children represent just 18 percent of preschool enrollment, they account for nearly half of all preschool suspensions. now, congresswoman beatty, we are talking toddlers ages 2 to 5. these kids don't even get a start, let alone a head start. they are being suspended from school. how do you suspend toddlers and babies from school? something is wrong with this. so we, i must say, in the appropriations committee are trying to address this with the department of education. this is immoral. when they get older, african american students are four times more likely to be expelled from school than their white peers for the same offense. more than half of all students who are involved in school- related arrests or referred to law enforcement are black or latino. this has a lasting effect and impact on young students. studies show that students who are disciplined by schools are more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system where their chances of returning to school are slim to none. this is unacceptable. these young people are having their futures ripped away before they even have a chance. we need to change the system and end the school-to-prison pipeline. first, we must start by making serious investments in our young people. we should ensure that all students have equal access to high-quality public school education. we must also expand summer youth job opportunities and summer training programs so that our teens have the opportunity to learn workforce skills, contribute to their communities, and start a path to economic opportunity. as a member of the subcommittee on early childhood, elementary, and secondary education, we are working to try to make sure that these resources become a priority of our subcommittee, which they, unfortunately, aren't at this point. we also need to tear down the institutional racism, quite frankly, that is holding students of color back and trapping our young people in a broken criminal justice system. i am reminded of when i was in the california legislature. i was on the public safety committee, and proposals were brought to us, plans for building prisons 10 to 12 years out for kids who are just starting kindergarten. that is what we had to deal with. now we see what has happened to the prison industrial complex in california. that is why we must work together and pass legislation to end mass incarceration and fix our broken criminal justice system. we need to get rid of these outdated minimum sentencing standards. these are relics from the failed war on drugs and disproportionately target people of color. in california, once again, the three strikes law passed. of course, i opposed that while in the california legislature. this law has incarcerated young african american men for nonviolent drug offenses 25 years to life. that is 25 years to life for nonviolent drug offenses. we need to repeal that law. we also need to make sure that law enforcement officers reflect the diversity of communities that they police. so we have introduced h. res. 262, which supports effective community-oriented policing and encourages greater diversity in law enforcement. during the last appropriation season, the congressional black caucus worked with congressman lacy clay to direct the department of justice to begin collecting training data. our legislation tracks when officers receive training for use of force, racial and ethnic bias, de- escalation of conflict, and constructive engagement with the public. this was just a small step, and we need to do more. with regard to reentry, banning the box is essential. we have worked with the white house to try to make sure that federal contractors ban the box. we haven't accomplished that, but federal agencies cannot now ask for one's criminal history records. in my district, we do expungement, we do record remedies. we have remedied thousands and thousands of young people who now can go on and move forward with their lives. i want to thank the family law center in oakland, california, for doing that. we need to go back to the drawing board and repeal the welfare reform provisions that are denied for life. there is a federal ban for food stamps, eligibility for public housing, and pell grants for those who have been incarcerated for drug felonies. now, you know who that targets; primarily african american and latino men. they don't even have a second chance when they get out of jail as a result of these lifetime bans. finally, let me just say it is time to really look at this problem in a big way and to understand that we have to dismantle, not reform--but we have to dismantle this prison industrial complex and start investing in our communities, especially our young children. and we must understand that, in doing this, we have to look at institutional and systemic racism, which is at the core of many of our policies. so this is a fight that we are going to win, but it is going to be because all of us here in the congressional black caucus--congresswoman beatty, congressman jeffries, congressman scott, and congresswoman jackson lee, and the entire membership--continue to fight the good fight to make sure that finally we will begin to see a real criminal justice system, which it is not right now. mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, i thank congresswoman lee. when people ask us why are we doing this today, i thank the gentlewoman for reminding us that the system is stacked against us and that we have had the future of so many of our young folks ripped away from them. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentlewoman from the great state of ohio (ms. fudge). she is from the 11th congressional district. she is an attorney. she has served as a former mayor. she is the immediate past chair of the congressional black caucus. she is someone who gives us advice. i remember her saying to us: push the envelope because you are the voice for the voiceless. look at the legislative issues that will make a difference in the lives of others. so tonight we come to talk about equal justice under the law. mr. speaker, we come to challenge this house. it is my great honor to yield to congresswoman marcia fudge. ms. fudge. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding. it is a pleasure to watch my fellow ohioan and friend and the gentleman from new york on this house floor every monday night bringing the message of the congressional black caucus because indeed they are the people who carry our message to the united states. mr. speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is robbing far too many children of productive futures. instead of learning in classrooms, a large percentage of our nation's at-risk students sit in jail cells. the numbers don't lie. black students are suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater than white students. more than one in four boys of color with disabilities and nearly one in five girls of color with disabilities receives an out-of-school suspension. and studies show that students who are suspended or expelled in school are more likely to end up in prison. our nation's children deserve better. it is time we prioritize education and not incarceration. comprehensive criminal justice reform must include policies which dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline. we must reauthorize the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act, a bill that funds delinquency prevention and improvements in state and local juvenile justice programs, supports restorative initiatives, and promotes early intervention. disrupting the pipeline will provide a pathway for a successful future and lessen the burden on our current judicial system. the number of people incarcerated in america quadrupled between 1980 and 2008. of the more than 2.3 million americans incarcerated today, more than 1 million of them are black. in my home state of ohio, more than 50,000 people are incarcerated in a system that was designed to only hold [[page h2423]] 39,000. and on average, states across this nation spend $30,000 per year to house one inmate. that is at least $19,000 more per year than we spend to educate one child. it is time we get our priorities straight. as ranking member of the education and the workforce subcommittee on early childhood, elementary, and secondary education, promoting policies that keep our children in school is one of my top priorities. i ask my colleagues: what are yours? mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, i thank congresswoman fudge for reminding us again of the value and the importance of our work. mr. speaker, at this time, it is indeed my honor to yield time to the gentleman from new york (mr. jeffries), who is coanchor of tonight's congressional black caucus special order hour. as i said earlier, congressman hakeem jeffries is not only a scholar, he, too, is an attorney. he is someone who walks the talk. he is someone who has a long history of being a brother's keeper. mr. speaker, so tonight, when we discuss this topic, when we talked about the challenge, when we talked about all of the plethora of things that are incorporated in why we must come forward tonight to challenge the criminal justice system which is stacked against us and broken, certainly we have heard the disparities as it relates to african americans. so it is indeed my honor to ask my coanchor, congressman hakeem jeffries, to share with us our challenge. mr. jeffries. mr. speaker, i thank the distinguished gentlewoman from ohio, my good friend, the distinguished and dynamic anchor for tonight's special order, congresswoman joyce beatty, for yielding and for her continued leadership and for leading the discussion on the house floor today as it relates the urgency of this congress and america dealing with the school-to-prison pipeline mass incarceration and the prison industrial complex that so many of my colleagues have explained and exposed here on the house floor today. a few years ago i had a conversation that has always stuck with me in the area of criminal justice when i was speaking to a formally incarcerated individual who spent several years behind bars incarcerated in a new york state penitentiary. he has turned his life around and he is now an advocate for criminal justice reform. he said to me on his final day, after being imprisoned for years in upstate new york, that he had a conversation with a high-ranking corrections officer, a supervisor who he had gotten to know and thought he had befriended to some degree during his time of incarceration. {time} 2000 on that last day, he said to this young african american incarcerated individual who was on his way out, he said: i just want to thank you. this gentleman was a little perplexed. he wasn't sure what he was talking about. he said: i just want to thank you for helping me to get my boat; and beyond that, i want to thank your son, who is going to help my son get his boat as well. that conversation has really haunted me because, in such a powerful and profound way, what it captures is the essence of what the prison industrial complex represents, which is this decision that was made in so many parts of the united states of america, certainly in new york, by democrats and republicans. when the automobile factories and the steel mills, the manufacturing plants began to close in the 1970s and in the 1980s, devastating parts of the upstate economy, a decision was made in place of those factory jobs to build prisons in their place as a means of economic development for depressed upstate communities. but here is the problem. if you build it, someone has got to fill those prisons. in order to fill those prisons, several things have developed which we are in the process of trying to dismantle right now: the school-to-prison pipeline and the criminalization of young people, particularly in communities of color, where they basically are not given a chance from the very beginning. as a result of being channeled unjustly, often, into the criminal justice system at an early age, they essentially become economic commodities for those who have come to rely on prisons to replace the factory and manufacturing jobs that have left the united states of america. that has been a big problem in new york. it is a problem in other parts of the country. it is a shame here in the united states of america that we have gone from a place where, when the war on drugs began in 1971--president nixon declared drug abuse public enemy number one--there were less than 350,000 people incarcerated in america. even when the crime bill that is being heavily debated in the public domain right now was passed in 1994, at the height of the concern about crime here in the united states of america, the incarcerated population was still under 900,000 people. but we have gone from less than 350,000 in 1971 to under 900,000 in 1994 to more than 2.2 million in 2016. the united states has 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's incarcerated individuals. we incarcerate more people than any other country in the world, and it is shameful. the school-to-prison pipeline is a large part of that dynamic, along with the failed war on drugs. so we are going to have to deal with this situation in a meaningful way. the statistics clearly show that, if you suspend a young person, that individual--often a black or latino boy--is less likely to graduate and complete school and more likely to become entangled in the criminal justice system because we have applied an overly punitive approach to discipline, particularly in the inner city. now, in this chamber, i have seen surprising levels of compassion as it relates to dealing with the heroin and opioid crisis that is sweeping across america right now, and i am glad that folks have decided to take a different approach than the approach that was taken in the 1980s with the crack cocaine epidemic that was sweeping across communities that those of us in the congressional black caucus represent. i welcome this newfound compassion. i just hope that you would extend it now not just to the manner in which we deal with the heroin crisis-- that is important--but let's extend it to the overcriminalization that is taking place as relates to young people across america, particularly in black and brown communities. i am glad that we have become enlightened as it relates to moving away from punishment and toward prevention and intervention related to the heroin and opioid crisis. let's also become enlightened in terms of dealing with breaking the school-to-prison pipeline. we will have more to say as we move forward with this discussion, but i know there are other members who would like to contribute to this hour of power that representative joyce beatty has brought to the house floor in connection with the cbc special order. mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, i thank congressman jeffries for reminding us that the united states makes up less than 5 percent of the world's population, yet incarcerates nearly a quarter of the global prison population. thank you for also being on point and reminding us, mr. speaker, if we are to reform america's criminal justice system and advance efforts to break the cycles of incarceration in african american communities, in low-income communities, then we must unite and make sure that we pass real legislation. mr. speaker, can you advise me how much time we have left, please. the speaker pro tempore. the gentlewoman from ohio has 12 minutes remaining. mrs. beatty. thank you, mr. speaker. mr. speaker, at this time, it is indeed my honor to yield to the gentlewoman who hails from the 18th congressional district of texas (ms. jackson lee). of the many things that this congresswoman does, she serves on the committee on the judiciary, she has been a longtime advocate for reforming the criminal justice system. i refer to her as a strong voice, a strong advocate, and, truly, a scholar. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i want to add my appreciation to the gentlewoman from ohio; the gentleman from new york; and the members who [[page h2424]] have spoken, including the chairman of the congressional black caucus, mr. butterfield; the former chair, ms. fudge; and the ranking member on the committee on education and the workforce, mr. scott. there could not be a more important topic than the topic that we are speaking about tonight. there are moments in history that i think come at times when urgency is the call of the day. it is often said that dr. king emphasized in his tenure the urgency of moving forward on civil rights and spoke eloquently about the fact of why we cannot wait. if i might, i want to capture his theme of why we cannot wait to end the school-to-prison pipeline. end it now and begin the whole comprehensive approach of criminal justice reform. let me take texas as an example and cite some very important statistics from the appleseed report and as well a comment on the work that we are doing in the committee on the judiciary. i am so glad at this moment in history to be the ranking member of the subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations and working with the members of my subcommittee, including mr. jeffries, who is a member, ms. bass, who is a member, and a number of other members as well, on this very difficult hurdle that we have. let it be very clear that this hurdle of criminal justice reform is, as i heard mr. jeffries make mention of, that we have taken hold of this issue of opioids and heroin in a way that not one single bill was passed last week that had a criminal focus, particularly out of the committee on the judiciary. not one bill had mandatory minimums. in the debate last week, on friday, i reiterated over and over again no mandatory minimums in this legislation. that should be the perfect that we try to achieve going forward on criminal justice reform. but let me give the beginnings of that very tragic outcome in america, filling up the nation's prisons, not having criminal justice but criminal unfairness. it starts with a path to incarceration, which includes in the schools, stops, failing public schools, zero tolerance and other school discipline, police in school hallways, disciplinary alternative schools, and court involvement in juvenile detention. all of these are a path for students to incarceration, and it is without understanding what a class c misdemeanor ticket and a trip to court for thousands of texas students and their families means. texas students as young as 6 have been ticketed at school in past years, and it is not uncommon for elementary school students to be ticketed by school-based law enforcement. school-based arrest of students often occurs without prior notice to parents. police officers in some texas schools are resorting to use of force, measures more commonly associated with fighting street crime: pepper spray, tasers, and trained canines when a schoolyard fight breaks out or when students are misbehaving in a cafeteria or at a school event. this should not be the picture for a 6-year-old or a 4-year-old or an 8-year-old or an 11-year-old or a 13-year-old. this should not be equated with school. let me read to you part of the appleseed report and a quote by ryan kellus turner and mark goodner: ``in a little over two decades, a paradigm shift has occurred in the lone star state. the misdeeds of children--acts that in the near recent past resulted in trips to the principal's office, corporal punishment, or extra laps under the supervision of a middle school or high school coach . . . '' now, of course, corporal punishment will be eliminated from that. what is worse, `` . . . now result in criminal prosecution, criminal records, and untold millions of dollars in punitive fines and hefty court costs being imposed against children ages 10 through 16.'' ``it is conservatively estimated that more than 275,000 non-traffic tickets are issued to juveniles in texas each year . . . '' and based on the information from the texas office of court administration, the number of non-traffic tickets issued to students may well grossly exceed that number because it was very difficult to get it. ``texas can interrupt this destructive cycle and prevent the loss of more young people to the `school-to-prison pipeline' through early interventions focused less on punishment and more on creating positive school environments that address students' academic and behavioral needs.'' let me just say that ``police officers in some texas schools are resorting to `use of force.' '' now, they are supposed to be there as sros. sros are supposed to have educational training. sros are supposed to be able to have the understanding of how to deal with counseling issues and teaching that is evidence based, but here is the problem. the problem is that they are focused more on law enforcement. i am glad to be part of this special order tonight that deals with the pipeline that has started working our children toward incarceration: overcrowded schools, lack of qualified teachers, inadequate resources, and then the zero tolerance for school discipline of children and the rate of suspension having increased dramatically in recent years from 1.7 million in 1974 to 3.1 million in 2000; and it has gone beyond that, and the greatest emphasis has been on children of color. so here is my call to the united states congress. we have to begin the process of dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline. we have to understand that children can learn. no child is a throwaway. i offer that often in my remarks in my district. the detention system is an unfair system. i don't know how many of you realize that when a child is sent to juvie, that child can remain there until they reach the age of 21. how does that happen? even if their sentence is not as egregious as one might think--a simple misbehavior in school. the way that happens is because in juvenile, you can assess more time on a child without telling that child's parent because that child did not follow orders or, in essence, that child did not behave or that child chewed gum when you told them not to. {time} 2015 we in the judiciary committee are working on juvenile justice reform. one of them that i am most concerned about and want to move is ending solitary confinement for juveniles, recognizing kalief's law, involving the death of one inside the new york prison at rikers island. the individual in solitary confinement had not been rendered guilty yet. and so we want to eliminate putting juveniles in solitary confinement. because the tragedy, mr. speaker, was that that youngster was released, ultimately, but after he was released, he, in essence, committed suicide. so i want to close my remarks by indicating that i want to turn this system upside down. i want to make sure that we deal with juvenile justice reform. i want to ban the box. we have done that in legislation that has not yet passed. i want to make sure that we have alternative sentencing. at the same time, the judiciary committee has moved two bills out of committee. i want to see these bills have a vigorous discussion and debate on the floor of the house so that we can move to conference. time is going by. let us not let the perfect be, in essence, the downfall of change. h.r. 3713 provides for the reduction of sentencing for many who are languishing, by law, in prison today in the federal system. as i have spoken to people across the country, they have indicated that, even though some states like my state of texas have made enormous, enormous strides--i am proud of that--it has not happened around the country. the bully pulpit of the federal government can be the most effective tool to moving toward criminal justice reform and sentencing reduction dealing with felony drug offenses. we are moving toward that point. a vote on the floor of the house and moving toward conference can move our efforts toward legislation that can truly be responsive to both concerns and as well positives that are in that bill. so as we deal with this prison pipeline, we have to not only talk, we have to do. and when we do, we have to make sure that we respond to the concerns, but we also have to make sure that we move legislation that can ultimately come out of the senate and go to conference and make a difference in the lives of so many. i want to thank the gentlewoman from ohio. i also want to say how [[page h2425]] timely the congressional black caucus is. all that have been crying out, from black lives matter to the mother of the movement, say that we need changes dealing with the whole vastness of criminal justice reform: police-community relations, police actions, actions dealing with guns, actions dealing with the loss of life of our young people. let's get a framework that can allow us to debate, to fix, to amend, and to get a product that will ultimately be signed by the president of the united states on behalf of the people of the united states who are crying out for relief. mr. speaker, i am pleased to join my colleagues of the congressional black caucus, congressman hakeem jeffries (d-ny) and congresswoman joyce beatty (d-oh) who are anchoring this special order on ending the school-to-prison pipeline. the over-criminalization of school children in america can no longer be swept under the rug, ignored or irrationally justified. we are in a state of national crisis and it is time to act. upon taking office, every member of congress makes a solemn pledge: to protect and defend the american people. this is the most important oath we take as elected officials--and, to honor this promise, we must do everything in our power to stem the school-to-prison pipeline in our nation. the three most important concerns for members of congress today are no. 1 children, no. 2 children, and no. 3 children. house republicans are still unwilling to act to stop the criminalization of our children in schools and instead work towards providing children the opportunity to thrive in american communities. this congress has a moral obligation to do our part to end the epidemic of losing our children to the correctional system. now is the time for republicans to join democrats in protecting the lives of america's youth by taking common sense steps in redirecting those who go astray. over the past year, several proposals have been introduced to address the need for overarching reform of our nation's criminal justice system. americans must consider the educational environment in which we place our students, from preschool to high school, subjecting them to disciplinary policies that more closely resemble policing than teaching. around the country, advocates are collecting data illustrating the devastating effects of what they call the ``school-to-prison pipeline,'' where student behavior is criminalized, children are treated like prisoners and, all too often, actually end up behind bars. the school-to-prison pipeline refers to interlocking sets of relationships at the institutional/structural and the individual levels. all of these policies and practices work together to push our nation's schoolchildren--youth of color, especially, our most at-risk children--out of schools and into unemployment and into the juvenile and criminal justice legal systems. this pipeline reflects the prioritization of incarceration over education. for a growing number of students, the path to incarceration includes the ``stops'' deterring matriculation such as: 1) failing public schools; 2) zero-tolerance and other school discipline; 3) policing school hallways; 4) disciplinary alternative schools; and 5) court involvement and juvenile detention. in a little over two decades, a paradigm shift has occurred in the lone star state. the misdeeds of children--acts that in the near recent past resulted in trips to the principal's office, corporal punishment, or extra laps under the supervision of a middle school or high school coach, now result in criminal prosecution, criminal records, and untold millions of dollars in punitive fines and hefty court costs being imposed against children in elementary and high schools. disrupting class, using profanity, misbehaving on a school bus, student fights, and truancy once meant a trip to the principal's office. today, such misbehavior results in a class c misdemeanor ticket and a trip to court for thousands of texas students and their families each year. it is conservatively estimated that more than 275,000 non-traffic tickets are issued to juveniles in texas each year. while it is impossible to pinpoint how many of these tickets are issued by campus police, the vast majority of these tickets are issued for offenses most commonly linked to school-related misbehavior-- disruption of class, disorderly conduct, disruption of transportation, truancy, and simple assaults related to student fights. ``criminalization'' of student misbehavior extends to even the youngest students. in texas, students as young as six have been ticketed at school in the past five years, and it is not uncommon for elementary-school students to be ticketed by school-based law enforcement. school-based arrest of students often occurs without prior notice to parents or a lawyer being present during initial questioning of the student. the increase in ticketing and arrest of students, in texas and nationwide, has coincided with the growth in school-based policing. campus policing is the largest and fastest growing area of law enforcement in texas, according to its own professional association. with counselors stretched to handle class scheduling and test administration duties, school administrators and teachers are increasingly turning to campus police officers to handle student behavior problems. today in texas, most public schools have a police officer assigned to patrol hallways, lunchrooms, school grounds, and after-school events. police officers in some texas schools are resorting to ``use of force'' measures more commonly associated with fighting street crime-- pepper spray, tasers and trained canines--when a schoolyard fight breaks out or when students are misbehaving in a cafeteria or at a school event. the intent is to keep schools and students safe, but there can be unintended consequences to disciplining public school students in a way that introduces them to the justice system or exposes them to policing techniques more commonly used with adults. texas can interrupt this destructive cycle and prevent the loss of more young people to the ``school-to-prison pipeline'' through early interventions focused less on punishment and more on creating positive school environments that address students' academic and behavioral needs. we must seek appropriate recommendations for reform. for most students, the pipeline begins with inadequate resources in public schools. overcrowded classrooms, a lack of qualified teachers, and insufficient funding for ``extras'' such as counselors, special education services, and even textbooks, lock students into second-rate educational environments. this failure to meet educational needs increases disengagement and dropouts, increasing the risk of later court involvement. even worse, schools may actually encourage dropouts in response to pressures from test-based accountability regimes such as the no child left behind act, which create incentives to push out low-performing students to boost overall test scores. lacking resources, facing incentives to push out low-performing students, and responding to a handful of highly-publicized school shootings, schools have embraced zero-tolerance policies that automatically impose severe punishment regardless of circumstances. under these policies, students have been expelled for bringing nail clippers or scissors to school. rates of suspension have increased dramatically in recent years--from 1.7 million in 1974 to 3.1 million in 2000--and have been most dramatic for children of color. overly harsh disciplinary policies push students down the pipeline and into the juvenile justice system. suspended and expelled children are often left unsupervised and without constructive activities. they also can easily fall behind in their coursework, leading to a greater likelihood of disengagement and drop-outs. all of these factors increase the likelihood of court involvement. as harsh penalties for minor misbehavior become more pervasive, schools increasingly ignore or bypass due process protections for suspensions and expulsions. the lack of due process is particularly acute for students with special needs, who are disproportionately represented in the pipeline despite the heightened protections afforded to them under law. many under-resourced schools become ``pipeline gateways'' by placing increased reliance on police rather than teachers and administrators to maintain discipline. growing numbers of districts employ school resource officers to patrol school hallways, often with little or no training in working with youth. as a result, children are far more likely to be subject to school- based arrests--the majority of which are for non-violent offenses, such as disruptive behavior--than they were a generation ago. the rise in school-based arrests, the quickest route from the classroom to the jailhouse, most directly exemplifies the criminalization of school children. in some jurisdictions, students who have been suspended or expelled have been completely denied their right to an education. in others, they are sent to disciplinary alternative schools. [[page h2426]] growing in number across the country, these shadow systems--sometimes run by private, for-profit companies--are immune from educational accountability standards (such as minimum classroom hours and curriculum requirements) and may fail to provide meaningful educational services to the students who need them the most. as a result, struggling students return to their regular schools unprepared, are permanently locked into inferior educational settings, or are funneled through alternative schools into the juvenile justice system. youth who become involved in the juvenile justice system are often denied procedural protections in the courts. studies demonstrate that as many as 80 percent of court-involved children do not have lawyers. students who commit minor offenses may end up in secured detention if they violate boilerplate probation conditions prohibiting them from activities like missing school or disobeying teachers. students pushed along the pipeline find themselves in juvenile detention facilities, many of which provide few, if any, educational services. students of color, who are far more likely than their white peers to be suspended, expelled, or arrested for the same kind of conduct at school, and those with disabilities are particularly likely to travel down this pipeline. though many students are propelled down the pipeline from school to jail, it is difficult for them to make the journey in reverse. students who enter the juvenile justice system face many barriers to their re-entry into traditional schools. the vast majority of these students never graduate from high school. numerous studies have also shown that as many as 70-80 percent of youth involved in the justice system meet the criteria for a disability. we must move away from the engrained culture of criminalization as the answer to our problems. it is no secret that 1 in every 3 black males born today can expect to go to prison at some point in their life, compared with 1 in every 6 latino males, and 1 in every 17 white males. it is a statistic we know well because it is one that has been reported since 2001 and has remained unchanged for nearly 15 years. it is time we stop repeating and start understanding and unraveling the fateful 1 in 3 trend that continues to sweep entire generations of young men of color into a lifetime of systematic and barriers. the united states currently has the largest number of prisoners in the world due to its skyrocketing national imprisonment rate. rather than investing in premier educational responses, the united states pays the highest cost globally for incarceration. federal, state, and local leaders are looking for innovative ways to improve public health and public safety outcomes, while reducing the costs of criminal justice and corrections. a number of innovative strategies can save public funds and improve public health by keeping low-risk, non-violent, drug-involved offenders out of prison or jail, while still holding them accountable and ensuring the safety of our communities. the obama administration is committed to funding and evaluating the long-term effects of these innovative criminal justice and corrections interventions. i too call upon my colleagues to come together and pass legislation that will help stop the derailment of children's lives. meanwhile, federal agencies will continue to seek opportunities to expand smart probation and problem-solving court initiatives around the country in collaboration with state, local, and tribal agencies. in recognition of the considerable potential in cost savings, improved outcomes for offenders, and improved public safety, a growing number of state and local officials around the country are starting their own promising initiatives to break the cycle of drug use, crime, and incarceration. nearly every state is struggling with significant shortfalls in revenue and making significant cuts to spending in order to close budget gaps. in making these cuts, many states are focusing attention on corrections spending, one of the fastest growing lines in state budgets over the past two decades. many states are pursuing a justice reinvestment approach, using data to determine what has been driving the growth in the prison population and how that growth might be stopped. in addition, small investments have been made in programs designed to reduce recidivism. new policies have been enacted, slowing the growth of prison populations or even downsizing corrections systems, saving states hundreds of millions of dollars. a portion of those savings are being reinvested in community-based services and supports, including substance abuse treatment. however, to have meaningful impact on behaviors that contribute to crime, recidivism, and substance abuse, states must focus on a handful of proven strategies that will maximize the impact of limited investments being made in the treatment of substance use disorders and community supervision. i am a strong supporter of education and i am particularly sensitive and protective of measures to keep students safe in school. in this same spirit, we must invest in a multi-step, collaborative process that involves the combined efforts of law enforcement, prosecutors, influential community members, social services, reentry services, community corrections, faith-based organizations, and city management. we have seen too often the horrific abuses of school officers dragging, punching, slapping, and more to students. first and foremost school-based law enforcement personnel need to be removed from the educational setting. and if law enforcement are not removed, they should be required to receive post-certification training in issues specific to youth, including: 1) de-escalation and mediation techniques; 2) restraint techniques to be used when force cannot be avoided; 3) signs and symptoms of trauma, abuse and neglect in children and youth, as well as appropriate responses; 4) signs and symptoms of mental illness in children and youth, and appropriate responses; and 5) manifestations of other disabilities, such as autism, and appropriate responses, adolescent development, juvenile law, and special education and applicable general education law. prohibit school districts from receiving any revenue from class c ticketing for truancy or any other offense. eliminate disruption of class and disruption of transportation as penal code offenses. prohibit ticketing of students under the age of 14. young children are simply not equipped to understand a class c misdemeanor ticket as a meaningful consequence of misbehavior, and the consequences of court involvement on academic success are too great to allow this practice to continue. ticketing of older students should be a last resort. ticketing, arrest and use of force in schools is preposterously reshaping today's school disciplinary policies disproportionately to actual need. we must acknowledge this epidemic and move to correct the inevitable injustice that follows when our children are derailed from their futures. i thank my colleagues of the congressional black caucus, congressman hakeem jeffries (d-ny) and congresswoman joyce beatty (d-oh) for hosting this special order on ending the school-to-prison pipeline. it is an invaluable and much needed effort. mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, let me just end by saying that the urgency is now. in the words of nelson mandela, ``it always seems impossible until it's done.'' tonight the congressional black caucus says: let's get it done. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, our children represent the future of our nation. our future is more promising when our children have a clear path to succeed and have the opportunities to become active members of the community. over time, a culture of favoring incarceration over education has become more prominent throughout our society--particularly as it relates to minority and low- income populations. financial shortfalls at all levels of government are also placing downward pressure on states and municipalities to cut back on public services and educational or community-based programs in favor of harsh criminalization or incarceration. the result is the ``school-to-prison pipeline,'' which poses a very real threat to our children and our society. this pipeline refers to harsh policies and practices that cultivate a culture where young individuals are pushed into the juvenile and criminal justice systems through harsh punishments in schools. inadequate resources in public schools, economic instability, zero-tolerance policies, and harsh punishments for non-violent offenses are all contributing to the school-to-prison pipeline. as a result, the united states suffers from the largest number of prisoners in the world and the economic and social burden of the high costs of incarceration. zero tolerance policies are dangerous to have in our schools. these policies impose extremely severe punishments on students, regardless of the circumstances, which can result in suspension or even expulsion from school. children of color and students with special needs have experienced a dramatic increase in these suspensions and expulsions, which greatly increase their probability of entering into the juvenile justice system. schools [[page h2427]] are also beginning to display an overreliance on law enforcement to maintain discipline through the use of school resource officers. mr. speaker, the school-to-prison pipeline is the result of a dangerous precedent being set in our schools. zero tolerance policies and the overreliance on law enforcement to keep order in our schools not only detracts from the culture of learning we expect in our schools, but also condemns countless children to a life of suffering for making simple mistakes during their youth. our society will suffer if we continue on this path of forcing children into the criminal justice system and it is time that we considered serious reforms to keep children in our communities and outside the juvenile justice system. ____________________",69383

Madam President, this week we commemorate National Police Week and pay tribute to the local, State, and Federal law enforcement officers who keep our country and our communities safe. We are grateful for their service and for their sacrifice. We benefit from their pledge to serve, protect, and defend. I had the pleasure recently of meeting with several officers from Richmond, KY, who were in town for the events of police week. I also met with the families of Kentucky police officers who laid down their lives in the line of duty. Tragically, five officers from the Bluegrass State were lost in 2015: on March 5, Lieutenant Clifford Scott Travis of the Bullitt County Detention Center; on March 11, Officer Burke Jevon Rhoads of the Nicholasville Police Department; on June 23, State Trooper Eric Keith Chrisman; on September 13, State Trooper Joseph Cameron Ponder; and on November 6, Senior Patrol Officer Daniel Neil Ellis of the Richmond Police Department. The names of these five officers, along with the names of hundreds of other brave officers from across the country, have been added to our national monument to law enforcement officers lost in the line of duty--the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. The names of over 500 Kentuckians appear on the memorial, and more than 20,000 names from across the country appear in all. That includes the four Capitol police officers we have lost in the line of duty since 1994. The Capitol police recently held a ceremony to honor their fallen officers. It reminds us of the continuing sacrifices of the men and women who stand guard every day at the very heart of our democracy. We are grateful for their service. I am a proud cosponsor of the resolution to recognize National Police Week this year. The resolution recognizes the work of active-duty law enforcement officers, the 25th anniversary of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, the 15th anniversary of 9/11, and all the officers lost in the line of duty in 2015. I am also a proud cosponsor of the Fallen Heroes Flag Act. This bill would create a program to provide flags that have been flown over the Capitol to the immediate family members of law enforcement and public safety officers who were lost in the line of duty. This bill has passed both the House and the Senate and is awaiting the President's signature. I am also a cosponsor, with my friend the senior Senator from Texas, of the POLICE Act. The POLICE Act would expand COPS grants so that those grants could be used for active-shooter training and to help equip law enforcement to respond to events like the San Bernardino shootings. Passing the POLICE Act would help give our police officers the training they need to do their jobs more effectively. I am hopeful we can quickly move to this important legislation. I am proud to represent Kentucky's police officers here in the Senate. Law enforcement is very dangerous work. It is also a noble calling, and I am grateful for the service of every police officer in Kentucky and across the Nation. I know my colleagues share my deep [[Page S2798]] admiration and respect for police officers everywhere. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2797-S2798] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL POLICE WEEK Mr. McCONNELL.

CREC-2016-05-16-pt1-PgS2798-3,CREC-2016-05-16,114,ZIKA VIRUS AND NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2798-S2799] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ZIKA VIRUS AND NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND Mr. REID. Madam President, what we know today is that the Zika virus was first discovered in 1947 in Uganda. It was first detected in monkeys, but in 1947 they also learned that the mosquito was now carrying this same virus the monkeys had. Initially, we didn't know or hear much about Zika. But we have heard plenty now, and we are going to hear a lot more. Researchers named the virus Zika because that is where the mosquito carrying the virus was discovered, in the Zika Forest of Uganda, as I mentioned. The Ugandan term ``zika'' means ``overgrown.'' So these mosquitoes with this virus were discovered in an overgrown forest in Uganda. Now, seven decades later, Zika is an international emergency, and countries are scrambling to address the problems created by this mosquito that bites. What I have learned is that there is more than one type of mosquito; there are two. Already Zika-carrying mosquitoes have transmitted the disease to American citizens in Puerto Rico and other United States territories. Soon, mosquitoes carrying this virus will be biting and infecting people in the continental United States. That is not hyperbole. It is going to happen. Zika-carrying mosquitoes won't be limited to the gulf coast. Madam President, look at this map. You can't see it very well on this, but you can see the discoloration here, the original coloring that we have. We have the blue, and we have the orange and the gray. Now, I was really surprised. I thought this would really be in the subtropical climates here in the United States, in the southern part of our country. I thought that is where it would be, but you can see that is not the case. Nevada is here, and Las Vegas is here. There are over 2 million people living there. It is all over the United States. Boulder, CO, is up here. Puerto Rico and Hawaii are here. This map is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it shows the estimated range of the two types of Zika-carrying mosquitoes. Areas of this map, as I have indicated, are three in color and cover 39 States. Most of these States, as I have indicated, don't have subtropical weather. Nevada, Colorado, Wisconsin, Ohio, Kentucky, New Hampshire, and Maine are listed. Health officials are desperate to stop Zika, this devastating virus that has been around so long but it was not known to carry all the many problems it now carries. It causes birth defects and other deadly conditions. Last week, a report on NPR described what Zika does to the brain as it begins to grow. This is one condition: As the brain . . . starts to grow, it creates pressure, which pushes on the skull and causes it to grow. But if something stops brain growth--such as [the Zika] virus-- pressure on the skull drops. And the skull can collapse down onto the brain. Two weeks ago we had people come to explain this to my caucus, and they described these skulls that just collapse. But Zika isn't only linked to birth defects. As I have indicated, the virus is also associated with a nervous system disorder that can result in paralysis, among other problems. Yet, in spite of all the devastating impacts of Zika, I am sorry to say, the Republicans in Congress don't see this virus as an urgent issue. Months ago, President Obama requested almost $2 billion to fight Zika, and for the same months the Republicans have refused to give the money America needs to fight this crisis. The best time to deal with any crisis is before it is here, but Republicans have dragged their feet. We should have passed an emergency spending bill months ago--months ago. We need to address Zika in the territories and give States and local governments the resources they are begging for. Last Thursday, appropriators filed an amendment that would provide $1.1 billion in Zika funding. That simply is not enough. This isn't about negotiating an arbitrary number made up by lawmakers. Our public health officials have made it clear they need that money. Senate Republicans are giving our government half of what it needs to fight this ravaging virus. This is beyond reckless. House Republicans are even doing less. The chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations last week said that Republicans are working on a Zika funding measure, but what House Republicans are proposing is even less than about half of the already low $1.1 billion amendment from Senate appropriators. Republicans are trying to haggle as if this is some sort of bidding war. That is not how Congress should react to a potentially disastrous health crisis. We know what is going on in Puerto Rico. We know. Because of Republicans' refusal to lift a finger to help fight the Zika crisis, the administration was forced to use Ebola funds in order to fight Zika now. They had to take about $510 million that was set aside specifically for Ebola. Two years ago, America was afraid of Ebola. Ebola is still a killer, and we invested in supporting public health infrastructures to prevent future outbreaks like the one we saw, as I indicated, 2 years ago. We need to replenish these monies so we can continue to work on vaccines and other things, but Republicans are standing in the way. It is really a sad commentary on Republicans that when asked for emergency funding to protect millions of Americans, they respond by offering half of what is needed. This is in a spending bill, and then we have to go to the House and have a conference. In the meantime, people are begging for this money. Republicans should be ashamed that we aren't doing everything in our power to protect the American people from this virus now. We should have an emergency spending bill on the floor now. If it were a flood or a fire that occurred, we would have been here. It is just too bad because this is a crisis that is already here. It is not an emerging crisis. It is here. Madam President, last week, the Republican leader came to the floor and here is what he said: ``We have elections in this country right on time, and that is not an excuse not to do our work.'' Again: ``We have elections in this country right on time, and that is not an excuse not to do our work.'' That is what Senator McConnell said. So I say to my friend from Kentucky: I agree. Elections are no excuse not to do our work. So Senate Republicans should do their job and give Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote. There is clearly no question that Merrick Garland is experienced and qualified to be a nominee. He is the nominee, and he has the expertise to go along with what a Supreme Court nominee should have. Throughout his decades as a prosecutor and judge, Mr. Garland has proven himself to be committed to the rule of law and following it. That is more than I can say for my Republican colleagues who, by refusing to consider this nominee, are rejecting their constitutional duties. The Republican leader needs to practice what he preaches. He says that elections shouldn't interfere with our Senate duties. He should prove it. The Republican Senators should prove that. Put aside Presidential elections, put aside Donald Trump, put aside all the phony excuses, and give Merrick Garland the consideration he deserves. Study Judge Garland's questionnaire; it is here. Analyze his record; it is here. Give him a hearing and send his nomination to the floor now. As the Republican leader put it, ``We have elections in this country right on [[Page S2799]] time, and that is not an excuse not to do our work.'' That is absolutely right. I would ask the Republicans to do their job. Madam President, on the Zika matter, I would add the following: ``The news from the House virtually guarantees that the Republican Congress will provide too little aid, too late to address the looming Zika crisis.'' The way things are going around here, the appropriations bills are not going to be finished until right before the end of this fiscal year, late September. The crisis will long have arrived and we will be talking about cases that exist in the continental United States. It is wrong to wait. I don't see anyone here on the floor, so I would ask the Chair to announce the business of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2798-S2799] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ZIKA VIRUS AND NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND Mr. REID.

Yet, in spite of all the devastating impacts of Zika, I am sorry to say, the Republicans in Congress don't see this virus as an urgent issue. Months ago, President Obama requested almost $2 billion to fight Zika, and for the same months the Republicans have refused to give the money America needs to fight this crisis. The best time to deal with any crisis is before it is here, but Republicans have dragged their feet. We should have passed an emergency spending bill months ago--months ago. We need to address Zika in the territories and give States and local governments the resources they are begging for. Last Thursday, appropriators filed an amendment that would provide $1.1 billion in Zika funding. That simply is not enough. This isn't about negotiating an arbitrary number made up by lawmakers. Our public health officials have made it clear they need that money. Senate Republicans are giving our government half of what it needs to fight this ravaging virus. This is beyond reckless. House Republicans are even doing less. The chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations last week said that Republicans are working on a Zika funding measure, but what House Republicans are proposing is even less than about half of the already low $1.1 billion amendment from Senate appropriators. Republicans are trying to haggle as if this is some sort of bidding war. That is not how Congress should react to a potentially disastrous health crisis. We know what is going on in Puerto Rico. We know. Because of Republicans' refusal to lift a finger to help fight the Zika crisis, the administration was forced to use Ebola funds in order to fight Zika now. They had to take about $510 million that was set aside specifically for Ebola. Two years ago, America was afraid of Ebola. Ebola is still a killer, and we invested in supporting public health infrastructures to prevent future outbreaks like the one we saw, as I indicated, 2 years ago. We need to replenish these monies so we can continue to work on vaccines and other things, but Republicans are standing in the way. It is really a sad commentary on Republicans that when asked for emergency funding to protect millions of Americans, they respond by offering half of what is needed. This is in a spending bill, and then we have to go to the House and have a conference. In the meantime, people are begging for this money. Republicans should be ashamed that we aren't doing everything in our power to protect the American people from this virus now. We should have an emergency spending bill on the floor now. If it were a flood or a fire that occurred, we would have been here. It is just too bad because this is a crisis that is already here. It is not an emerging crisis. It is here. Madam President, last week, the Republican leader came to the floor and here is what he said: ``We have elections in this country right on time, and that is not an excuse not to do our work.'' Again: ``We have elections in this country right on time, and that is not an excuse not to do our work.'' That is what Senator McConnell said. So I say to my friend from Kentucky: I agree. Elections are no excuse not to do our work. So Senate Republicans should do their job and give Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote. There is clearly no question that Merrick Garland is experienced and qualified to be a nominee. He is the nominee, and he has the expertise to go along with what a Supreme Court nominee should have. Throughout his decades as a prosecutor and judge, Mr. Garland has proven himself to be committed to the rule of law and following it. That is more than I can say for my Republican colleagues who, by refusing to consider this nominee, are rejecting their constitutional duties. The Republican leader needs to practice what he preaches. He says that elections shouldn't interfere with our Senate duties. He should prove it. The Republican Senators should prove that. Put aside Presidential elections, put aside Donald Trump, put aside all the phony excuses, and give Merrick Garland the consideration he deserves. Study Judge Garland's questionnaire; it is here. Analyze his record; it is here. Give him a hearing and send his nomination to the floor now. As the Republican leader put it, ``We have elections in this country right on [[Page S2799]] time, and that is not an excuse not to do our work.'' That is absolutely right. I would ask the Republicans to do their job. Madam President, on the Zika matter, I would add the following: ``The news from the House virtually guarantees that the Republican Congress will provide too little aid, too late to address the looming Zika crisis.'' The way things are going around here, the appropriations bills are not going to be finished until right before the end of this fiscal year, late September. The crisis will long have arrived and we will be talking about cases that exist in the continental United States. It is wrong to wait. I don't see anyone here on the floor, so I would ask the Chair to announce the business of the day. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2798-S2799] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ZIKA VIRUS AND NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND Mr. REID. Madam President, what we know today is that the Zika virus was first discovered in 1947 in Uganda. It was first detected in monkeys, but in 1947 they also learned that the mosquito was now carrying this same virus the monkeys had. Initially, we didn't know or hear much about Zika. But we have heard plenty now, and we are going to hear a lot more. Researchers named the virus Zika because that is where the mosquito carrying the virus was discovered, in the Zika Forest of Uganda, as I mentioned. The Ugandan term ``zika'' means ``overgrown.'' So these mosquitoes with this virus were discovered in an overgrown forest in Uganda. Now, seven decades later, Zika is an international emergency, and countries are scrambling to address the problems created by this mosquito that bites. What I have learned is that there is more than one type of mosquito; there are two. Already Zika-carrying mosquitoes have transmitted the disease to American citizens in Puerto Rico and other United States territories. Soon, mosquitoes carrying this virus will be biting and infecting people in the continental United States. That is not hyperbole. It is going to happen. Zika-carrying mosquitoes won't be limited to the gulf coast. Madam President, look at this map. You can't see it very well on this, but you can see the discoloration here, the original coloring that we have. We have the blue, and we have the orange and the gray. Now, I was really surprised. I thought this would really be in the subtropical climates here in the United States, in the southern part of our country. I thought that is where it would be, but you can see that is not the case. Nevada is here, and Las Vegas is here. There are over 2 million people living there. It is all over the United States. Boulder, CO, is up here. Puerto Rico and Hawaii are here. This map is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it shows the estimated range of the two types of Zika-carrying mosquitoes. Areas of this map, as I have indicated, are three in color and cover 39 States. Most of these States, as I have indicated, don't have subtropical weather. Nevada, Colorado, Wisconsin, Ohio, Kentucky, New Hampshire, and Maine are listed. Health officials are desperate to stop Zika, this devastating virus that has been around so long but it was not known to carry all the many problems it now carries. It causes birth defects and other deadly conditions. Last week, a report on NPR described what Zika does to the brain as it begins to grow. This is one condition: As the brain . . . starts to grow, it creates pressure, which pushes on the skull and causes it to grow. But if something stops brain growth--such as [the Zika] virus-- pressure on the skull drops. And the skull can collapse down onto the brain. Two weeks ago we had people come to explain this to my caucus, and they described these skulls that just collapse. But Zika isn't only linked to birth defects. As I have indicated, the virus is also associated with a nervous system disorder that can result in paralysis, among other problems.

Madam President, 3 months ago President Barack Obama asked this Congress for funding to address a public health emergency: combating the Zika Virus. I am pleased that this week, 14 weeks after his request, we are going to respond. We are not responding in full. The President asked for $1.9 billion to address this serious public health challenge. We are not responding without some theatrics and posturing first, but we are going to vote on some amendments this week, and it is about time. It has been 14 weeks since representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health testified at the Senate Appropriations Committee on the dire need for immediate action to combat the Zika virus. I visited the Centers for Disease Control about 14 weeks ago. By then, they had been able to verify that the tissue samples from miscarriages and other serious health problems coming in from Brazil were linked to the Zika Virus. So there was no question that these mosquitoes carrying this virus had serious public health consequences-- so serious that the Centers for Disease Control dedicated 1,000 staffers to deal with this issue. That was about 12 or 14 weeks ago. The President used his authority to come to Congress and say: We have a public health emergency; treat it like it is an emergency. Here we are 14 weeks later getting around to discussing it. When I think back in times of American history when Congress has been called on to respond to an emergency, there have been amazing examples where partisanship was set aside and people said: In the interest of America, we need to act and act now. Whether we are talking about mobilizing for a war, whether we are talking about responding to terrorism, we have done it. We can do it. This time we have failed. We have failed for 14 weeks. In that period of time, 1,200 Americans in 44 States, Washington, DC, and 3 U.S. territories, including over 110 pregnant women, have contracted Zika. Six more have contracted Guillain-Barre, an autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis and death. Recently, the first Zika-caused death and the first Zika-related microcephaly cases were reported in Puerto Rico. In my State of Illinois, 16 people have tested positive for Zika, including at least 3 pregnant women. Over the past few months, we have learned more about Zika and how dangerous it can be. We now know it is carried by two types of mosquitoes. We now know it is linked to serious neurological damage and birth defects in children. We now know it can be sexually transmitted. We also know that the mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus thrive in the warm summer months, which is why this action should have been taken long ago and must be taken this week. The best way to fight a public health threat such as Zika is to have a strong, stable public health infrastructure in place. That is what the President asked for. That means reliable and stable funding year after year. Our public health agencies have to be viewed as the first line of defense, just as we view the Pentagon as the first line of defense when it comes to military and terrorist threats. Our public health agencies are the first line of defense when we are speaking of Ebola, the Zika virus, and a variety of other challenges that could literally threaten the health and lives of innocent Americans. We must ensure robust and stable funding for agencies like the Centers for Disease Control. These invasive problems can pop up at any time. We can't rally to each and every occurrence after it happens; we have to be prepared. The Centers for Disease Control is not only the best, it is the best in the world, but it cannot operate without adequate funding. The National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine right now to protect all of us from the Zika virus. That is the answer, but it takes time--a year. We should have been moving on it sooner. We must provide critical resources to the Food and Drug Administration. Their reviewers are responsible for ensuring that any Zika treatments or vaccines are safe and effective, and in order to ensure the safety of those vaccines and treatments, they have to be clinically tested. For years we have heard congressional Republicans rail against Federal spending and even embrace the notion of a sequester--a blind across-the-board cut. Case in point: Over the past few months, we have heard Republicans protest, stall, and push back on providing funding to help combat the Zika virus. There have been a variety of excuses for their delay, but the outcome has always been the same: We have lost time in responding to this public health emergency. For years, those of us on this side of the aisle have been arguing that this approach--one of starving funding and endless delays--is shortsighted and irresponsible. Yes, we must be good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars, but I would argue that there is no better use of the taxpayers' dollars than investments in public health--investments in the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Food and Drug Administration. These are investments that prepare our Nation for the unforeseen, such as Zika or Ebola, but they are also investments that help us prepare for the foreseen situations that Americans face every day, such as Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's, and diabetes. That is why I introduced the American Cures Act--legislation that would provide our Federal health research agencies reliable and robust funding increases every year into the future. We are not going to win a war against Zika, Ebola, Alzheimer's, or cancer if our response is tepid, delayed, watered down, or subject to the whims of political fate. Big budget cuts make a good talking point in a speech somewhere, but the results can be devastating. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee to find a path forward to address the funding of these critical Federal health agencies. There is more to do, and we must do it together. If we don't do it together, we will pay a heavy price. This week we will take up the issue. We will be voting on three Zika- related amendments this week. The first, offered by Senator Nelson of Florida, is one that I fully support. It would fulfill the President's request by providing the $1.9 billion in needed funding to ensure an immediate and comprehensive response to Zika. We need to treat this public health emergency like a public health emergency. Senator Nelson's amendment would ensure that the CDC has the money they need to support States in conducting surveillance, vector control, emergency communications, and research. It would ensure that the National Institutes of Health has the money to develop this vaccine, and it would ensure that USAID has the money they need to build up a global health response to Zika. [[Page S2800]] I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Nelson amendment. It would provide the United States, as well as pregnant women in many affected countries, with the very best chance of minimizing the damage done by the Zika virus. Let's not be penny wise and pound foolish. Cutting back on this money for pregnant women and running the risk that a baby is born with a lifetime of medical challenges and expenses is not a way to save money; it is a disaster for the family and a disaster for our budget. Then comes the second amendment, offered by Senator Cornyn of Texas. This is a misguided amendment. I urge my colleagues to defeat it. Senator Cornyn's amendment would provide a portion of the funding needed to adequately respond to the Zika virus. He picked the number $1.1 billion and said: Let's take the money out of the Prevention and Public Health Fund for America--money that is currently being invested to deal with other health challenges around our country. In order to deal with the Zika virus, Senator Cornyn would take money away from other efforts to keep Americans healthy. The prevention fund accounts for 12 percent--nearly $900 million--of the Centers for Disease Control's core public health efforts, such as lead poisoning prevention, breast and cervical cancer screening, and tobacco prevention and control. Think about that for a second. Senator Cornyn of Texas wants to take the money out of those areas--legitimate public health concerns--and put it in Zika. He is going to move some of the pieces around on the chessboard in the hope of moving the right one. Sadly, it will endanger innocent people. There is something else to be considered. His amount is $1.1 billion, and the President asked for $1.9 billion. For some reason, Senator Cornyn believes that we can reduce the threat of the Zika virus by 40 percent on the floor of the Senate. I don't buy it. This is a public health emergency. Reducing the funding for it from what the President requested by 40 percent is playing Russian roulette with innocent lives across America and around the world. Senator Cornyn's amendment cuts base funding that would ordinarily be provided to the Centers for Disease Control. We are also dealing with lead poisoning issues across America, which was yesterday's front-page story in the Chicago Tribune. All of the lead testing around my State of Illinois finds that areas you wouldn't dream of--the suburbs of Chicago, including some of the wealthier suburbs of Chicago--sadly have too much lead in the water. We know that after what happened in Flint, we have to take it seriously. The impact on innocent children is obvious. Cutting back on funding for that to pay for the Zika virus is robbing Peter to pay Paul. Lastly, we have an amendment that will be offered by Senator Blunt. It is like Senator Cornyn's approach in that it would only provide $1.1 billion, and I take exception to that number. As I said, it is 40 percent less than what the President believes is needed for this emergency, but it would not cut the money out of the prevention fund, so that is a positive thing to say about the Blunt amendment over the Cornyn amendment. This amendment is an improvement, but still, it is important for us to adequately fund public health defense for innocent Americans. When Dr. Frieden of the CDC tells us how much the CDC needs to fight Zika, I trust the doctor. I do not believe we should second-guess his approach, and I don't believe we should provide the Centers for Disease Control with less money than what Dr. Frieden says is needed. That said, I appreciate that Senator Blunt is trying. I hope the initial amendment by Senator Nelson passes. That is the responsible amendment to deal with the public health emergency. We have seen Zika coming for months. We had the administration's detailed, comprehensive plan of action sitting up here for over 3 months. The time to act is way overdue. It is my hope that the Senate will finally approve Zika funding this week and that House Republicans will stop their stalling as well and get to work and do the same. We have lost enough time already. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share some remarks and ask unanimous consent that I be allowed such time as I may consume. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Durbin's comments, and I believe there is clear bipartisan support for dealing with the Zika virus. And something will be done on that, but make no mistake-- there is a disagreement, and our colleagues on the Democratic side, as they always do, just want to add whatever new expense comes up during the year to the deficit of the United States of America. There are many ways we can save money to pay for new expenditures, and that is what Senator Cornyn is talking about. He wants to have it paid-for so we don't add more debt. You say: How can that be? Well, we are already in debt. This year we borrowed approximately $540 billion to fund the government. We spent $4 trillion and we borrowed $540 billion of that. That is a very large number. It is unsustainable, and it is getting worse. We have to start paying for things that we want to do around here and make some choices and set some priorities. That is the entire dispute about this matter, if you want to know the truth about it. There is no way we can't find the money to fund this Zika challenge--sufficient funds to do that--within the spending we already have. NOMINATION OF PAULA XINIS Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to the nomination of Paula Xinis to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. By all accounts, she is a nice person and has a number of admirers. I don't question her integrity. I had an exchange with her at the Judiciary Committee hearing when she came before the committee. I think this nominee has perhaps the most hostile record toward police of any I have seen in a long time. Her background is troubling to me, and I believe it justifies us not allowing her to have a lifetime appointment where she is unaccountable to anyone as she conducts her daily duties involving, on a very frequent basis, the appearance of police before her in criminal cases of all kinds. She would even hear cases against police officers for misconduct that may come before her over her career. I was a prosecutor for almost 15 years in Federal court before Federal judges. I was blessed to appear before Federal judges of high quality who gave the prosecutor a fair trial and gave the defendant a fair trial, and that is what we are looking for. I am aware of a lot of Federal judges who have a clear bias against law enforcement and have made the communities less safe, made prosecuting a nightmare, and I don't believe it is good for the legal system. There is nothing you can do about it. A judge can declare that the evidence is insufficient to convict on his or her own motion which nobody can appeal. That is the final word even though a jury, had they been able to hear the case, might have found otherwise. Yesterday was Peace Officers Memorial Day, and this week is Police Week. We take special occasion each year to remember the service and sacrifice of law enforcement officers and their indispensable role in ensuring law and order in our cities and towns throughout the country. Too often when something goes wrong on the streets today, the media is quick to point their fingers at the police, and that is why we have an impartial justice system--so that the facts can come out in open court. In my experience, when those facts do come out--and I have had the duty of prosecuting police officers--many more times than not, we learn that the police did everything they could according to the procedures and that the complaints we heard about in the media and through others are not accurate. That is what the facts show us time and time again. It is critical that we have judges who respect the rights of the accused but also respect the role of law enforcement and the dangers they face on a daily basis. We have a nominee for the Federal court in Maryland before us, and every police officer in the country needs to know where she stands and how she approaches the duties, responsibilities, [[Page S2801]] and requirements of the police and how she approaches law enforcement. Will she give them a fair hearing? Aren't they entitled to that? Ms. Paula Xinis worked as a Federal public defender for the District of Maryland for 13 years; that is, she was on a paid defender's staff who defended the criminals who were being prosecuted in Federal court, those accused for a whole lot of crimes. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a perfectly honorable profession, and I certainly want to emphasize that. For 6 of those 13 years, she simultaneously served as a complaint examiner in the Office of Police Complaints for the District of Columbia here in DC. During the course of her work there, she heard complaints against police officers for conduct as part of their duties. She heard six complaints, and in every one of those cases, every single one, she found against the police officers. It troubled me, and I asked her some questions about it. In one of the cases, an officer arrested a man who was loitering amidst a group of individuals outside a grocery store while talking on his cell phone. When he was asked to move along, he refused to do so. Then the man became belligerent and repeatedly swore and cursed at the police officer. The officer eventually arrested the man for disorderly conduct. On the panel, Ms. Xinis concluded that the police had harassed the man and found the police officer guilty of misconduct. When I asked her about this decision at her confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee, she said she didn't even know what consequences this finding might have on the career of a police officer as a result of having this on their record. In 2011, Ms. Xinis began work with her current 11-attorney law firm in Baltimore, where she focuses her practice emphasis on lawsuits against the police. According to her firm's Web site, she and two of her colleagues recently settled a $5 million police brutality lawsuit. Notably, her firm also represented the family of Freddie Gray, Jr., the 25-year-old man who was arrested on April 12, 2015, for possessing an illegal switchblade and who subsequently tragically died in police custody, causing riots in Baltimore, if my colleagues recall. On September 8, 2015, the suit against the city and the police department, in which her firm represented the plaintiff, settled for $6.4 million. This may have been a totally justified settlement. I certainly believe that any death in the custody of a police officer by any accused is entitled to and requires a thorough investigation. But in a big city like Baltimore, when there is civil unrest and huge public attention, cities are under political, if not legal, pressure to reach some sort of financial settlement. This was a tragic case. The details were disputed. But it appears that some of the facts were not clear, certainly. The point is, Ms. Xinis has built a career of dealing with lawsuits against police and police departments and dealing with complaints against the police. In every complaint case she heard, she ruled against the police, which, frankly, makes me uneasy, as it does many law enforcement officers. When a lawyer sits as a complaint examiner in a case involving alleged police misconduct, the examiner--the judge, almost, in that case--should know and understand the reality of police work and what our people have to do every day to defend us from crime. I asked her about her findings that the arrest of a loud, cursing loiterer outside a store was police harassment. In other words, the cursing loiterer was OK, but the police officer was wrong. I would think that someone who has spent their entire professional career in this arena would be familiar with some of the concepts and procedures in policing in cities around the country today. For example, broken windows policing is well known. I think most people know what broken windows policing is. It is a short-hand way to describe a policy that originally grew and became predominant in New York City under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and many believe it saved New York City. Crime was surging, disorder was about, the city's financial status was at risk, and they started a systematic smart method of policing, and the murder rate is less than half of what it was in New York City. The entire city has been transformed. So here she is judging police officers about how to handle confrontations on the street and how to make our communities safer. Shouldn't she know about these things? Broken windows policing suggests that when law enforcement consistently enforces the law in cases involving minor crimes--not just big crimes but even minor crimes--that consistency helps to prevent major crimes. It is proven to work. It is a major trend. Virtually every city in America does it. Yes, we have people who are out on the streets causing trouble or risks, and they get their backs up and complain when anybody says anything to them. Police officers have to use judgment. But this police officer, to me, did what one would normally expect him to do. He certainly didn't need to be charged and convicted of harassment. Her statement that she did not know what ``broken windows'' was and was not familiar with it I think evidenced a real lack of understanding. There is concern about this appointment by people who have to deal with this every day. Here is a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police, the Baltimore City lodge, signed by Lieutenant Gene Ryan, President. Again, this is the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police: On behalf of almost 5,000 members of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #3, I write this letter in extreme opposition to the appointment of Paula Xinis as a United States District Judge in the Federal District Court system. While on paper, Ms. Xinis appears to be a highly qualified criminal attorney, our membership is urgently concerned about her obvious disdain for the law enforcement profession as expressed time and again through the various court appearances in which she has represented citizens claiming harm caused by police personnel. In fact, her current partnership in the Baltimore firm of Murphy, Falcon, & Murphy itself is of concern as this is a firm well known in our area for hostility toward our profession and our members and, as a result, we question the ability of Ms. Xinis to remain impartial in any Federal cases involving law enforcement. Senators, we respectfully request that you give consideration to our request to deny the appointment of Paula Xinis to the Federal bench at this time. I also have a letter from the Maryland State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, President Ismael Vincent Canales. He writes: As President of the Maryland Fraternal Order of Police and on behalf of over twenty-thousand active and retired law enforcement officers throughout the State of Maryland, I respectfully request that members of the U.S. Senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of Paula Xinis as a Judge to the United States District Court of Maryland. I believe that Ms. Xinis at this time fails to have the requisite temperament and ability to be fair and impartial on matters that directly affect law enforcement. And he goes on. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two letters be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Fraternal Order of Police, Baltimore City Lodge No. 3, Baltimore, MD, May 16, 2016. To All Members of the United States Senate: On behalf of the almost 5,000 members of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #3, I write this letter in extreme opposition to the appointment of Paula Xinis as a United States District Judge in the Federal District Court system. While, on paper, Ms. Xinis appears to be a highly qualified criminal attorney, our membership is urgently concerned about her obvious disdain for the law enforcement profession as expressed time and again through the various court appearances in which she has represented citizens claiming harm caused by police personnel. In fact, her current partnership in the Baltimore law firm of Murphy, Falcon & Murphy itself is of concern as this is a firm well known in our area for hostility toward our profession and our members and, as a result, we question the ability of Ms. Xinis to remain impartial in any Federal cases involving law enforcement. Senators, we respectfully request that you give consideration to our request to deny the appointment of Paula Xinis to the Federal Bench at this time, and any time In the future. Most sincerely, Lt. Gene Ryan, President, Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #3. [[Page S2802]] ____ Maryland State Lodge, Fraternal Order of Police, Baltimore, MD, May 16, 2016. Hon. Jeff Sessions, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Jeff Sessions: As President of the Maryland Fraternal Order of Police, and on behalf of the over twenty- thousand active and retired law enforcement officers throughout the State of Maryland, I respectfully request that the members of the United States Senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of Paula Xinis as a Judge to the United States District Court of Maryland. After careful review and consideration, I believe that Ms. Xinis at this time fails to have the requisite temperament and ability to be fair and impartial on matters that directly affect law enforcement. Based on prior and recent experience, Ms. Xinis has shown a clear bias towards law enforcement which began in her position as a complaint examiner in the Office of Police Complaints for the District of Columbia and culminated with her involvement in the civil suit surrounding the Freddie Gray Case in Baltimore City, MD. Ms. Xinis is clearly a consummate advocate which we commend her for. However, at this time, I do not believe that she has displayed throughout her professional career a sufficient ability to equitably apply the law. It is for these reasons that I respectfully request that the Senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of Paula Xinis to the United States District Court of Maryland. Sincerely, Vince Canales. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Federal judges decide cases every day that have a significant real world impact on our criminal justice system--sometimes good, sometimes bad. Let me point out this case. It gives an insight into the kinds of things I saw every day as a prosecutor, and it is happening every day right now in courts all over America. Here is the case before United States District Judge Royce C. Lamberth. He denied a request by the prosecutor for early release of two top associates of Rayful Edmond III, a notorious drug kingpin in Washington, DC. I think they made a movie about him or a film about him, one of the most notorious gang leaders around. The Washington Post described Judge Lamberth's astonishment when the U.S. Attorney did not object to the drug felon's request for early release. Quote: The judge rebuked the Office of acting United States attorney Vincent H. Cohen Jr., of the District, saying prosecutors did not give due weight to the criminal history of Butler, 52, the Los Angeles-based cocaine broker and partner of D.C. drug lord Rayful Edmond III, and Jones, 58, one of four top armed enforcers of Edmond's violent trafficking network. The group imported as much as 1,700 pounds of Colombian cocaine a month. That is almost a ton a month. That is the largest amount I have ever seen. I thought the biggest case I had ever seen was 600 pounds flown in on about 20 plane loads over several months. This is 1,700 pounds a month. Edmond's organization enabled drug addiction on a scale that until then ``was unprecedented and largely unimaginable'' in Washington, Lamberth wrote, and the harm the defendants caused ``is immeasurable and in many cases irreversible.'' ``To put it bluntly, the court is surprised and disappointed by the United States Attorney's decision to not oppose the present motions,'' Lamberth said. Quote: ``The court struggles to understand how the government could condone the release of Butler and Jones, each convicted of high-level, sophisticated and violent drug trafficking offenses.'' So that is a Federal judge doing their duty. I am not sure where Ms. Xinis would be on this. Contrast that with many courts across the country that are currently rubberstamping motions for early release for Federal drug trafficking felons under the Sentencing Commission's reductions to the sentencing guidelines that have already occurred and that are impacting the prison population significantly, as we will see. That is according to an October 2015 article in the Los Angeles Times entitled ``The face of the federal prison release: A heavy dose of meth, crack, and cocaine.'' This is what the article says: A federal analysis of the expected impact of the first wave of those approved for early release shows 663 prisoners from California had filed for shorter sentences as of late July. Federal judges denied 92 of them. It looks as though six out of seven were granted. According to an October 2015 article regarding offenders released in the Pittsburgh area, the U.S. Attorney's Office there ``erred on the side of granting'' the motions. So the U.S. attorney's office is not defending the legitimate, original sentence that was imposed. They walk in and just don't--if there is any doubt about it, they just go along with the prisoner's request. According to a November 2015 article entitled ``Upstate NY gang members on secret list of 6,000 freed early from prison,'' it is happening in New York too. Quote: In the Northern District of New York, the [Court, prosecutors, and defense attorneys] agreed on the eligibility of almost all of the inmates, and disagreed on only five cases that became subject to litigation. . . . Of those five cases, a judge ordered early release for three and rejected one. A fifth case is pending. So out of all the cases, only one was rejected. Judges have a duty to make sure that they--they don't have to take everything the prosecutor says. The prosecutor sometimes asks for a higher sentence than a judge wants to give, but a judge is equally required to reject a prosecutor's failure to oppose unjustified reductions. This is, frankly, President Obama's policy, and the policy of the Attorney General, whom he has appointed--Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder before her--basically to cut people's sentences that have been lawfully imposed throughout this country. In my opinion, it is impacting public safety and will continue to do so in the future. Judges must protect the rights of the accused, absolutely, and give them a fair hearing, as they are required to do, but they must give the people, the police, and the prosecutor the right to a fair trial also. These kind of cases cause concern about who is protecting the public. Would Judge Xinis be more likely to follow the pattern of Judge Royce Lamberth in saying no or go along with these other cases? Over the past year, our law enforcement officers across the country have been shot at, assaulted, and murdered, too often simply because they wear a badge. Last year we lost 123 police officers--35 in the first 4 months of 2016. Violent crime and murders have increased across the country at alarming rates. Let me share with my colleagues some of the things we are seeing in trends in violent crime. Recently, the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association, a long-established group, called an emergency meeting to deal with the numbers I am going to share with you today. The numbers I will quote represent the percentage of increase in total murders in the first quarter of this year, 2016, over the first quarter of 2015: Las Vegas, 82 percent increase; Dallas, TX, 73 percent increase; Chicago, 70 percent; Jacksonville, FL, 67 percent; Newark, NJ, 60 percent increase; Miami-Dade, 38 percent; Los Angeles, 33 percent; Atlanta, 20 percent; Baltimore, 10 percent. These are substantial increases in crime. The FBI Director, Mr. Comey, a long-term experienced law officer, who served at the top of the Department of Justice as a prosecutor, recently said he believes the pushback on police officers--this trend of attacking and blaming police officers--has caused some drawback and reluctance of police officers to take on situations like the guy at the store standing out front that was cursing the police officer. Properly handled, those kinds of things reduce crime. They help violence not to start. Once it gets started, bad things can happen. Oftentimes, somebody gets killed. It is not like on television where somebody punches somebody and they get up and walk away and laugh about it. A good punch breaks teeth, jaws, and can kill. This increase in murder rates is significant, and we have to be aware of it. Lives are at stake, many innocent people. If we get off the right path, we will lose lives as a result of criminal conduct. Think about some of the cases, such as that of Kate Steinle in California, who was out with her father and was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported multiple times. Judges have to know this isn't a game. We don't want to put anybody in jail, but if we don't maintain order in cities, chaos can result, innocent people will die, and prosperity will be reduced. According to the FBI statistics released just this year, the number of [[Page S2803]] violent crimes committed across the country was up in the first half of 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. The number of murders, rapes, assaults, and robberies were up all over the first 6 months of 2015. There was a 6.2-percent increase in murder. Violent crime across America rose 5.3 percent in large cities, and overall violent crime increased 1.7 percent, an increase that followed two consecutive years of decline. In my judgment, what I am seeing is this is a long-term trend. I think we will continue to see this increase. I wish it weren't so, but I am afraid it is. According to statistics released Friday by the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association, the number of homicides increased in the first months of 2016 in more than two dozen major cities. The Washington Post reports ``the numbers were particularly grim for a handful of places--Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas and Las Vegas--where the numbers of homicides increased in the first three months of 2016. . . . '' The article goes on to quote FBI Director Comey. He said: I was very worried about it last fall, and I am in many ways more worried, because the numbers are not only going up, they're continuing to go up in most of those cities faster than they were going up last year. Something is happening. I don't know what the answer is, but holy cow, do we have a problem. He also said before our committee that he remembered the last crimewave in the seventies and the sixties and how enforcement brought it down dramatically. He said we don't want to forget the lessons we learned previously. Director Comey has further suggested that possible explanations for this spike in violent crime included gang and drug violence. He has also suggested that greater scrutiny of police as they do their duty has possibly changed the way officers and communities interact, something he calls the ``viral video effect,'' which he believes leads to less aggressive policing. Less aggressive policing means more crime and more deaths. On Mother's Day weekend in Chicago, more than 50 people were shot between Friday afternoon and early Monday. During a 3\1/2\-hour period early Saturday, one man was killed and 14 others wounded, as the Chicago Tribune said, ``the equivalent of someone being shot every 14 minutes.'' According to the Tribune, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson ``saved his harshest criticism for a criminal justice system that he said isn't putting away the city's most dangerous offenders for long enough periods. `Until we have real truth in sentencing and hold these offenders accountable, this will be the unfortunate reality in the city of Chicago.' '' According to an article in the Washington Post, April 2 of this year, ``violence is occurring at levels unseen for years [in Chicago]. In the first quarter of 2016, 141 people were killed, up from 82 last year, according to police department data. The number of shootings surged to 677 from 359 a year earlier. The city is on track to have more than 500 killings this year, which would make this just the third year since 2004 that Chicago topped that figure.'' Some say we have too many people in prison. We have heard that. It is certainly our responsibility, in part, in Congress, to set sentencing laws that are smart, that protect the public, don't put too many people in jail, and strike the right balance. In the early to mid-1980s, Congress passed, in a bipartisan, overwhelming vote, mandatory minimum sentences and sentencing guidelines. They allowed dangerous people to be denied bail on appeal. They allowed people who made frivolous appeals--for the judge to assert that there was no substantial basis for the appeal and he could leave them in jail while they made their appeals because too many people were filing for appeals just to stay out of jail and committed crimes while they were out. All of these are great reforms. They are now under systemic attack. During that entire period of time, the crime rate in America went down. The murder rate in the late nineties was half what it was in 1980. How many good people are alive today because of this improvement in law enforcement? We ended the revolving door, where people were arrested, released, arrested. They came in another time and they are arrested and then they would get out and murder somebody. It was happening all the time. We didn't have the jail capacity to put the people in jail. We didn't have enough police to deal with the surging crime rate. When you have 20-, 30-, 40-percent increases in crime, you are talking about doubling the crime and murder rate in America in 2 or 3 years, after we spent 20 years bringing it down by half. We have to be sure that what we are doing, colleagues, is smart, and we are not signing death warrants for thousands of American innocent citizens. Well, what is the prison situation today? Is the population going up? According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the rate of imprisonment in the United States is at its lowest in a decade. The Federal prison population--195,914 as of May 12, 2016--is at its lowest level since 2006. Since 2013, the Federal prison population has decreased by over 20,000, and it is projected to continue downward. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the population is projected to drop another 10,000 this year, which will bring it to its lowest levels since 2005. The Bureau of Prisons, which houses prisoners, ``projects that the inmate population will continue to decline for the next couple of years, particularly as a result of retroactive changes to sentencing guidelines.'' Indeed, the 46,276 Federal drug trafficking inmates made eligible for early release comprise 25 percent of the current prison population. Admissions to Federal prisons have declined every year since 2011 and will likely decline further due to the Obama administration's policy directing prosecutors not to charge certain criminal offenses. I don't think this Congress has a duty to confirm everyone who is appointed by the President. We know the President has hostility toward prisons. He has directed his Attorney General to reduce prison populations, and that is happening. He has directed the Bureau of Prisons to participate in this. He has directed the Attorney General and the Attorney General has agreed and issued policy that rejects Attorney General Thornburgh's policies when I was a U.S. attorney. Basically, the Thornburgh policy was, if a person used a gun during a crime, a bank robbery, or drug dealing, they were required, under the law, to get an additional 5 years' penalty in addition because the goal was to deter people from carrying guns during the criminal act, therefore, having fewer people killed in this country. It actually worked. In my opinion, it was part of the reason for the decline in the murder rate, clearly. You were required to charge them because the law said, if you carried a gun, you must get 5 years in addition to the other penalties. Now the Attorney General tells everybody: Well, prosecutors, you don't have to charge that; in fact, we don't want you to charge too much on these kinds of cases. As a result, the prosecutions are down, drug prosecutions are down 21 percent, and sentencing is down too. When I asked the Attorney General why the prosecutions of these cases are down so much, she said they are prosecuting bigger cases. I have to say that for the last 50 years, that is the excuse that prosecutors use for having a decline in statistics. They say: Well, we are working bigger cases. But regardless if you are working bigger cases, why are the sentencing numbers down? Presumably, she is saying: We are prosecuting more serious criminals, but the sentences are going down. We are seeing from the prosecutorial end a significant retrenchment or backing off of strong prosecution policy. A judge who gets a lifetime appointment and is no longer accountable to the American people--or anyone else, for that matter--is not entitled to confirmation if we have doubts about the ability over the years to treat police fairly and protect the public from serious criminals. Certainly, it does not send a positive message to police and the community in Baltimore, where she will hear cases if confirmed. Last year was the deadliest year in Baltimore's history--344 murders and countless crimes against persons and property. I believe Ms. Xinis's record demonstrates such a lack of understanding of the reality of law enforcement and the duty of our whole criminal justice system to protect the public as to disqualify her from the Federal bench. [[Page S2804]] That is why I will oppose the nomination. I do not believe she lacks the personal qualities or the integrity needed to be a judge or be a successful person throughout her life, whatever job she holds. She certainly has many admirers. I am not questioning that, but her record, as I have discussed, indicates an approach to law enforcement that does not justify the support of a lifetime appointment. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2799-S2804] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ZIKA VIRUS Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 3 months ago President Barack Obama asked this Congress for funding to address a public health emergency: combating the Zika Virus. I am pleased that this week, 14 weeks after his request, we are going to respond. We are not responding in full. The President asked for $1.9 billion to address this serious public health challenge. We are not responding without some theatrics and posturing first, but we are going to vote on some amendments this week, and it is about time. It has been 14 weeks since representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health testified at the Senate Appropriations Committee on the dire need for immediate action to combat the Zika virus. I visited the Centers for Disease Control about 14 weeks ago. By then, they had been able to verify that the tissue samples from miscarriages and other serious health problems coming in from Brazil were linked to the Zika Virus. So there was no question that these mosquitoes carrying this virus had serious public health consequences-- so serious that the Centers for Disease Control dedicated 1,000 staffers to deal with this issue. That was about 12 or 14 weeks ago. The President used his authority to come to Congress and say: We have a public health emergency; treat it like it is an emergency. Here we are 14 weeks later getting around to discussing it. When I think back in times of American history when Congress has been called on to respond to an emergency, there have been amazing examples where partisanship was set aside and people said: In the interest of America, we need to act and act now. Whether we are talking about mobilizing for a war, whether we are talking about responding to terrorism, we have done it. We can do it. This time we have failed. We have failed for 14 weeks. In that period of time, 1,200 Americans in 44 States, Washington, DC, and 3 U.S. territories, including over 110 pregnant women, have contracted Zika. Six more have contracted Guillain-Barre, an autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis and death. Recently, the first Zika-caused death and the first Zika-related microcephaly cases were reported in Puerto Rico. In my State of Illinois, 16 people have tested positive for Zika, including at least 3 pregnant women. Over the past few months, we have learned more about Zika and how dangerous it can be. We now know it is carried by two types of mosquitoes. We now know it is linked to serious neurological damage and birth defects in children. We now know it can be sexually transmitted. We also know that the mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus thrive in the warm summer months, which is why this action should have been taken long ago and must be taken this week. The best way to fight a public health threat such as Zika is to have a strong, stable public health infrastructure in place. That is what the President asked for. That means reliable and stable funding year after year. Our public health agencies have to be viewed as the first line of defense, just as we view the Pentagon as the first line of defense when it comes to military and terrorist threats. Our public health agencies are the first line of defense when we are speaking of Ebola, the Zika virus, and a variety of other challenges that could literally threaten the health and lives of innocent Americans. We must ensure robust and stable funding for agencies like the Centers for Disease Control. These invasive problems can pop up at any time. We can't rally to each and every occurrence after it happens; we have to be prepared. The Centers for Disease Control is not only the best, it is the best in the world, but it cannot operate without adequate funding. The National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine right now to protect all of us from the Zika virus. That is the answer, but it takes time--a year. We should have been moving on it sooner. We must provide critical resources to the Food and Drug Administration. Their reviewers are responsible for ensuring that any Zika treatments or vaccines are safe and effective, and in order to ensure the safety of those vaccines and treatments, they have to be clinically tested. For years we have heard congressional Republicans rail against Federal spending and even embrace the notion of a sequester--a blind across-the-board cut. Case in point: Over the past few months, we have heard Republicans protest, stall, and push back on providing funding to help combat the Zika virus. There have been a variety of excuses for their delay, but the outcome has always been the same: We have lost time in responding to this public health emergency. For years, those of us on this side of the aisle have been arguing that this approach--one of starving funding and endless delays--is shortsighted and irresponsible. Yes, we must be good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars, but I would argue that there is no better use of the taxpayers' dollars than investments in public health--investments in the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Food and Drug Administration. These are investments that prepare our Nation for the unforeseen, such as Zika or Ebola, but they are also investments that help us prepare for the foreseen situations that Americans face every day, such as Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's, and diabetes. That is why I introduced the American Cures Act--legislation that would provide our Federal health research agencies reliable and robust funding increases every year into the future. We are not going to win a war against Zika, Ebola, Alzheimer's, or cancer if our response is tepid, delayed, watered down, or subject to the whims of political fate. Big budget cuts make a good talking point in a speech somewhere, but the results can be devastating. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee to find a path forward to address the funding of these critical Federal health agencies. There is more to do, and we must do it together. If we don't do it together, we will pay a heavy price. This week we will take up the issue. We will be voting on three Zika- related amendments this week. The first, offered by Senator Nelson of Florida, is one that I fully support. It would fulfill the President's request by providing the $1.9 billion in needed funding to ensure an immediate and comprehensive response to Zika. We need to treat this public health emergency like a public health emergency. Senator Nelson's amendment would ensure that the CDC has the money they need to support States in conducting surveillance, vector control, emergency communications, and research. It would ensure that the National Institutes of Health has the money to develop this vaccine, and it would ensure that USAID has the money they need to build up a global health response to Zika. [[Page S2800]] I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Nelson amendment. It would provide the United States, as well as pregnant women in many affected countries, with the very best chance of minimizing the damage done by the Zika virus. Let's not be penny wise and pound foolish. Cutting back on this money for pregnant women and running the risk that a baby is born with a lifetime of medical challenges and expenses is not a way to save money; it is a disaster for the family and a disaster for our budget. Then comes the second amendment, offered by Senator Cornyn of Texas. This is a misguided amendment. I urge my colleagues to defeat it. Senator Cornyn's amendment would provide a portion of the funding needed to adequately respond to the Zika virus. He picked the number $1.1 billion and said: Let's take the money out of the Prevention and Public Health Fund for America--money that is currently being invested to deal with other health challenges around our country. In order to deal with the Zika virus, Senator Cornyn would take money away from other efforts to keep Americans healthy. The prevention fund accounts for 12 percent--nearly $900 million--of the Centers for Disease Control's core public health efforts, such as lead poisoning prevention, breast and cervical cancer screening, and tobacco prevention and control. Think about that for a second. Senator Cornyn of Texas wants to take the money out of those areas--legitimate public health concerns--and put it in Zika. He is going to move some of the pieces around on the chessboard in the hope of moving the right one. Sadly, it will endanger innocent people. There is something else to be considered. His amount is $1.1 billion, and the President asked for $1.9 billion. For some reason, Senator Cornyn believes that we can reduce the threat of the Zika virus by 40 percent on the floor of the Senate. I don't buy it. This is a public health emergency. Reducing the funding for it from what the President requested by 40 percent is playing Russian roulette with innocent lives across America and around the world. Senator Cornyn's amendment cuts base funding that would ordinarily be provided to the Centers for Disease Control. We are also dealing with lead poisoning issues across America, which was yesterday's front-page story in the Chicago Tribune. All of the lead testing around my State of Illinois finds that areas you wouldn't dream of--the suburbs of Chicago, including some of the wealthier suburbs of Chicago--sadly have too much lead in the water. We know that after what happened in Flint, we have to take it seriously. The impact on innocent children is obvious. Cutting back on funding for that to pay for the Zika virus is robbing Peter to pay Paul. Lastly, we have an amendment that will be offered by Senator Blunt. It is like Senator Cornyn's approach in that it would only provide $1.1 billion, and I take exception to that number. As I said, it is 40 percent less than what the President believes is needed for this emergency, but it would not cut the money out of the prevention fund, so that is a positive thing to say about the Blunt amendment over the Cornyn amendment. This amendment is an improvement, but still, it is important for us to adequately fund public health defense for innocent Americans. When Dr. Frieden of the CDC tells us how much the CDC needs to fight Zika, I trust the doctor. I do not believe we should second-guess his approach, and I don't believe we should provide the Centers for Disease Control with less money than what Dr. Frieden says is needed. That said, I appreciate that Senator Blunt is trying. I hope the initial amendment by Senator Nelson passes. That is the responsible amendment to deal with the public health emergency. We have seen Zika coming for months. We had the administration's detailed, comprehensive plan of action sitting up here for over 3 months. The time to act is way overdue. It is my hope that the Senate will finally approve Zika funding this week and that House Republicans will stop their stalling as well and get to work and do the same. We have lost enough time already. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share some remarks and ask unanimous consent that I be allowed such time as I may consume. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Durbin's comments, and I believe there is clear bipartisan support for dealing with the Zika virus. And something will be done on that, but make no mistake-- there is a disagreement, and our colleagues on the Democratic side, as they always do, just want to add whatever new expense comes up during the year to the deficit of the United States of America. There are many ways we can save money to pay for new expenditures, and that is what Senator Cornyn is talking about. He wants to have it paid-for so we don't add more debt. You say: How can that be? Well, we are already in debt. This year we borrowed approximately $540 billion to fund the government. We spent $4 trillion and we borrowed $540 billion of that. That is a very large number. It is unsustainable, and it is getting worse. We have to start paying for things that we want to do around here and make some choices and set some priorities. That is the entire dispute about this matter, if you want to know the truth about it. There is no way we can't find the money to fund this Zika challenge--sufficient funds to do that--within the spending we already have. NOMINATION OF PAULA XINIS Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to the nomination of Paula Xinis to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. By all accounts, she is a nice person and has a number of admirers. I don't question her integrity. I had an exchange with her at the Judiciary Committee hearing when she came before the committee. I think this nominee has perhaps the most hostile record toward police of any I have seen in a long time. Her background is troubling to me, and I believe it justifies us not allowing her to have a lifetime appointment where she is unaccountable to anyone as she conducts her daily duties involving, on a very frequent basis, the appearance of police before her in criminal cases of all kinds. She would even hear cases against police officers for misconduct that may come before her over her career. I was a prosecutor for almost 15 years in Federal court before Federal judges. I was blessed to appear before Federal judges of high quality who gave the prosecutor a fair trial and gave the defendant a fair trial, and that is what we are looking for. I am aware of a lot of Federal judges who have a clear bias against law enforcement and have made the communities less safe, made prosecuting a nightmare, and I don't believe it is good for the legal system. There is nothing you can do about it. A judge can declare that the evidence is insufficient to convict on his or her own motion which nobody can appeal. That is the final word even though a jury, had they been able to hear the case, might have found otherwise. Yesterday was Peace Officers Memorial Day, and this week is Police Week. We take special occasion each year to remember the service and sacrifice of law enforcement officers and their indispensable role in ensuring law and order in our cities and towns throughout the country. Too often when something goes wrong on the streets today, the media is quick to point their fingers at the police, and that is why we have an impartial justice system--so that the facts can come out in open court. In my experience, when those facts do come out--and I have had the duty of prosecuting police officers--many more times than not, we learn that the police did everything they could according to the procedures and that the complaints we heard about in the media and through others are not accurate. That is what the facts show us time and time again. It is critical that we have judges who respect the rights of the accused but also respect the role of law enforcement and the dangers they face on a daily basis. We have a nominee for the Federal court in Maryland before us, and every police officer in the country needs to know where she stands and how she approaches the duties, responsibilities, [[Page S2801]] and requirements of the police and how she approaches law enforcement. Will she give them a fair hearing? Aren't they entitled to that? Ms. Paula Xinis worked as a Federal public defender for the District of Maryland for 13 years; that is, she was on a paid defender's staff who defended the criminals who were being prosecuted in Federal court, those accused for a whole lot of crimes. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a perfectly honorable profession, and I certainly want to emphasize that. For 6 of those 13 years, she simultaneously served as a complaint examiner in the Office of Police Complaints for the District of Columbia here in DC. During the course of her work there, she heard complaints against police officers for conduct as part of their duties. She heard six complaints, and in every one of those cases, every single one, she found against the police officers. It troubled me, and I asked her some questions about it. In one of the cases, an officer arrested a man who was loitering amidst a group of individuals outside a grocery store while talking on his cell phone. When he was asked to move along, he refused to do so. Then the man became belligerent and repeatedly swore and cursed at the police officer. The officer eventually arrested the man for disorderly conduct. On the panel, Ms. Xinis concluded that the police had harassed the man and found the police officer guilty of misconduct. When I asked her about this decision at her confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee, she said she didn't even know what consequences this finding might have on the career of a police officer as a result of having this on their record. In 2011, Ms. Xinis began work with her current 11-attorney law firm in Baltimore, where she focuses her practice emphasis on lawsuits against the police. According to her firm's Web site, she and two of her colleagues recently settled a $5 million police brutality lawsuit. Notably, her firm also represented the family of Freddie Gray, Jr., the 25-year-old man who was arrested on April 12, 2015, for possessing an illegal switchblade and who subsequently tragically died in police custody, causing riots in Baltimore, if my colleagues recall. On September 8, 2015, the suit against the city and the police department, in which her firm represented the plaintiff, settled for $6.4 million. This may have been a totally justified settlement. I certainly believe that any death in the custody of a police officer by any accused is entitled to and requires a thorough investigation. But in a big city like Baltimore, when there is civil unrest and huge public attention, cities are under political, if not legal, pressure to reach some sort of financial settlement. This was a tragic case. The details were disputed. But it appears that some of the facts were not clear, certainly. The point is, Ms. Xinis has built a career of dealing with lawsuits against police and police departments and dealing with complaints against the police. In every complaint case she heard, she ruled against the police, which, frankly, makes me uneasy, as it does many law enforcement officers. When a lawyer sits as a complaint examiner in a case involving alleged police misconduct, the examiner--the judge, almost, in that case--should know and understand the reality of police work and what our people have to do every day to defend us from crime. I asked her about her findings that the arrest of a loud, cursing loiterer outside a store was police harassment. In other words, the cursing loiterer was OK, but the police officer was wrong. I would think that someone who has spent their entire professional career in this arena would be familiar with some of the concepts and procedures in policing in cities around the country today. For example, broken windows policing is well known. I think most people know what broken windows policing is. It is a short-hand way to describe a policy that originally grew and became predominant in New York City under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and many believe it saved New York City. Crime was surging, disorder was about, the city's financial status was at risk, and they started a systematic smart method of policing, and the murder rate is less than half of what it was in New York City. The entire city has been transformed. So here she is judging police officers about how to handle confrontations on the street and how to make our communities safer. Shouldn't she know about these things? Broken windows policing suggests that when law enforcement consistently enforces the law in cases involving minor crimes--not just big crimes but even minor crimes--that consistency helps to prevent major crimes. It is proven to work. It is a major trend. Virtually every city in America does it. Yes, we have people who are out on the streets causing trouble or risks, and they get their backs up and complain when anybody says anything to them. Police officers have to use judgment. But this police officer, to me, did what one would normally expect him to do. He certainly didn't need to be charged and convicted of harassment. Her statement that she did not know what ``broken windows'' was and was not familiar with it I think evidenced a real lack of understanding. There is concern about this appointment by people who have to deal with this every day. Here is a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police, the Baltimore City lodge, signed by Lieutenant Gene Ryan, President. Again, this is the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police: On behalf of almost 5,000 members of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #3, I write this letter in extreme opposition to the appointment of Paula Xinis as a United States District Judge in the Federal District Court system. While on paper, Ms. Xinis appears to be a highly qualified criminal attorney, our membership is urgently concerned about her obvious disdain for the law enforcement profession as expressed time and again through the various court appearances in which she has represented citizens claiming harm caused by police personnel. In fact, her current partnership in the Baltimore firm of Murphy, Falcon, & Murphy itself is of concern as this is a firm well known in our area for hostility toward our profession and our members and, as a result, we question the ability of Ms. Xinis to remain impartial in any Federal cases involving law enforcement. Senators, we respectfully request that you give consideration to our request to deny the appointment of Paula Xinis to the Federal bench at this time. I also have a letter from the Maryland State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, President Ismael Vincent Canales. He writes: As President of the Maryland Fraternal Order of Police and on behalf of over twenty-thousand active and retired law enforcement officers throughout the State of Maryland, I respectfully request that members of the U.S. Senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of Paula Xinis as a Judge to the United States District Court of Maryland. I believe that Ms. Xinis at this time fails to have the requisite temperament and ability to be fair and impartial on matters that directly affect law enforcement. And he goes on. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two letters be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Fraternal Order of Police, Baltimore City Lodge No. 3, Baltimore, MD, May 16, 2016. To All Members of the United States Senate: On behalf of the almost 5,000 members of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #3, I write this letter in extreme opposition to the appointment of Paula Xinis as a United States District Judge in the Federal District Court system. While, on paper, Ms. Xinis appears to be a highly qualified criminal attorney, our membership is urgently concerned about her obvious disdain for the law enforcement profession as expressed time and again through the various court appearances in which she has represented citizens claiming harm caused by police personnel. In fact, her current partnership in the Baltimore law firm of Murphy, Falcon & Murphy itself is of concern as this is a firm well known in our area for hostility toward our profession and our members and, as a result, we question the ability of Ms. Xinis to remain impartial in any Federal cases involving law enforcement. Senators, we respectfully request that you give consideration to our request to deny the appointment of Paula Xinis to the Federal Bench at this time, and any time In the future. Most sincerely, Lt. Gene Ryan, President, Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #3. [[Page S2802]] ____ Maryland State Lodge, Fraternal Order of Police, Baltimore, MD, May 16, 2016. Hon. Jeff Sessions, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Jeff Sessions: As President of the Maryland Fraternal Order of Police, and on behalf of the over twenty- thousand active and retired law enforcement officers throughout the State of Maryland, I respectfully request that the members of the United States Senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of Paula Xinis as a Judge to the United States District Court of Maryland. After careful review and consideration, I believe that Ms. Xinis at this time fails to have the requisite temperament and ability to be fair and impartial on matters that directly affect law enforcement. Based on prior and recent experience, Ms. Xinis has shown a clear bias towards law enforcement which began in her position as a complaint examiner in the Office of Police Complaints for the District of Columbia and culminated with her involvement in the civil suit surrounding the Freddie Gray Case in Baltimore City, MD. Ms. Xinis is clearly a consummate advocate which we commend her for. However, at this time, I do not believe that she has displayed throughout her professional career a sufficient ability to equitably apply the law. It is for these reasons that I respectfully request that the Senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of Paula Xinis to the United States District Court of Maryland. Sincerely, Vince Canales. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Federal judges decide cases every day that have a significant real world impact on our criminal justice system--sometimes good, sometimes bad. Let me point out this case. It gives an insight into the kinds of things I saw every day as a prosecutor, and it is happening every day right now in courts all over America. Here is the case before United States District Judge Royce C. Lamberth. He denied a request by the prosecutor for early release of two top associates of Rayful Edmond III, a notorious drug kingpin in Washington, DC. I think they made a movie about him or a film about him, one of the most notorious gang leaders around. The Washington Post described Judge Lamberth's astonishment when the U.S. Attorney did not object to the drug felon's request for early release. Quote: The judge rebuked the Office of acting United States attorney Vincent H. Cohen Jr., of the District, saying prosecutors did not give due weight to the criminal history of Butler, 52, the Los Angeles-based cocaine broker and partner of D.C. drug lord Rayful Edmond III, and Jones, 58, one of four top armed enforcers of Edmond's violent trafficking network. The group imported as much as 1,700 pounds of Colombian cocaine a month. That is almost a ton a month. That is the largest amount I have ever seen. I thought the biggest case I had ever seen was 600 pounds flown in on about 20 plane loads over several months. This is 1,700 pounds a month. Edmond's organization enabled drug addiction on a scale that until then ``was unprecedented and largely unimaginable'' in Washington, Lamberth wrote, and the harm the defendants caused ``is immeasurable and in many cases irreversible.'' ``To put it bluntly, the court is surprised and disappointed by the United States Attorney's decision to not oppose the present motions,'' Lamberth said. Quote: ``The court struggles to understand how the government could condone the release of Butler and Jones, each convicted of high-level, sophisticated and violent drug trafficking offenses.'' So that is a Federal judge doing their duty. I am not sure where Ms. Xinis would be on this. Contrast that with many courts across the country that are currently rubberstamping motions for early release for Federal drug trafficking felons under the Sentencing Commission's reductions to the sentencing guidelines that have already occurred and that are impacting the prison population significantly, as we will see. That is according to an October 2015 article in the Los Angeles Times entitled ``The face of the federal prison release: A heavy dose of meth, crack, and cocaine.'' This is what the article says: A federal analysis of the expected impact of the first wave of those approved for early release shows 663 prisoners from California had filed for shorter sentences as of late July. Federal judges denied 92 of them. It looks as though six out of seven were granted. According to an October 2015 article regarding offenders released in the Pittsburgh area, the U.S. Attorney's Office there ``erred on the side of granting'' the motions. So the U.S. attorney's office is not defending the legitimate, original sentence that was imposed. They walk in and just don't--if there is any doubt about it, they just go along with the prisoner's request. According to a November 2015 article entitled ``Upstate NY gang members on secret list of 6,000 freed early from prison,'' it is happening in New York too. Quote: In the Northern District of New York, the [Court, prosecutors, and defense attorneys] agreed on the eligibility of almost all of the inmates, and disagreed on only five cases that became subject to litigation. . . . Of those five cases, a judge ordered early release for three and rejected one. A fifth case is pending. So out of all the cases, only one was rejected. Judges have a duty to make sure that they--they don't have to take everything the prosecutor says. The prosecutor sometimes asks for a higher sentence than a judge wants to give, but a judge is equally required to reject a prosecutor's failure to oppose unjustified reductions. This is, frankly, President Obama's policy, and the policy of the Attorney General, whom he has appointed--Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder before her--basically to cut people's sentences that have been lawfully imposed throughout this country. In my opinion, it is impacting public safety and will continue to do so in the future. Judges must protect the rights of the accused, absolutely, and give them a fair hearing, as they are required to do, but they must give the people, the police, and the prosecutor the right to a fair trial also. These kind of cases cause concern about who is protecting the public. Would Judge Xinis be more likely to follow the pattern of Judge Royce Lamberth in saying no or go along with these other cases? Over the past year, our law enforcement officers across the country have been shot at, assaulted, and murdered, too often simply because they wear a badge. Last year we lost 123 police officers--35 in the first 4 months of 2016. Violent crime and murders have increased across the country at alarming rates. Let me share with my colleagues some of the things we are seeing in trends in violent crime. Recently, the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association, a long-established group, called an emergency meeting to deal with the numbers I am going to share with you today. The numbers I will quote represent the percentage of increase in total murders in the first quarter of this year, 2016, over the first quarter of 2015: Las Vegas, 82 percent increase; Dallas, TX, 73 percent increase; Chicago, 70 percent; Jacksonville, FL, 67 percent; Newark, NJ, 60 percent increase; Miami-Dade, 38 percent; Los Angeles, 33 percent; Atlanta, 20 percent; Baltimore, 10 percent. These are substantial increases in crime. The FBI Director, Mr. Comey, a long-term experienced law officer, who served at the top of the Department of Justice as a prosecutor, recently said he believes the pushback on police officers--this trend of attacking and blaming police officers--has caused some drawback and reluctance of police officers to take on situations like the guy at the store standing out front that was cursing the police officer. Properly handled, those kinds of things reduce crime. They help violence not to start. Once it gets started, bad things can happen. Oftentimes, somebody gets killed. It is not like on television where somebody punches somebody and they get up and walk away and laugh about it. A good punch breaks teeth, jaws, and can kill. This increase in murder rates is significant, and we have to be aware of it. Lives are at stake, many innocent people. If we get off the right path, we will lose lives as a result of criminal conduct. Think about some of the cases, such as that of Kate Steinle in California, who was out with her father and was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported multiple times. Judges have to know this isn't a game. We don't want to put anybody in jail, but if we don't maintain order in cities, chaos can result, innocent people will die, and prosperity will be reduced. According to the FBI statistics released just this year, the number of [[Page S2803]] violent crimes committed across the country was up in the first half of 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. The number of murders, rapes, assaults, and robberies were up all over the first 6 months of 2015. There was a 6.2-percent increase in murder. Violent crime across America rose 5.3 percent in large cities, and overall violent crime increased 1.7 percent, an increase that followed two consecutive years of decline. In my judgment, what I am seeing is this is a long-term trend. I think we will continue to see this increase. I wish it weren't so, but I am afraid it is. According to statistics released Friday by the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association, the number of homicides increased in the first months of 2016 in more than two dozen major cities. The Washington Post reports ``the numbers were particularly grim for a handful of places--Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas and Las Vegas--where the numbers of homicides increased in the first three months of 2016. . . . '' The article goes on to quote FBI Director Comey. He said: I was very worried about it last fall, and I am in many ways more worried, because the numbers are not only going up, they're continuing to go up in most of those cities faster than they were going up last year. Something is happening. I don't know what the answer is, but holy cow, do we have a problem. He also said before our committee that he remembered the last crimewave in the seventies and the sixties and how enforcement brought it down dramatically. He said we don't want to forget the lessons we learned previously. Director Comey has further suggested that possible explanations for this spike in violent crime included gang and drug violence. He has also suggested that greater scrutiny of police as they do their duty has possibly changed the way officers and communities interact, something he calls the ``viral video effect,'' which he believes leads to less aggressive policing. Less aggressive policing means more crime and more deaths. On Mother's Day weekend in Chicago, more than 50 people were shot between Friday afternoon and early Monday. During a 3\1/2\-hour period early Saturday, one man was killed and 14 others wounded, as the Chicago Tribune said, ``the equivalent of someone being shot every 14 minutes.'' According to the Tribune, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson ``saved his harshest criticism for a criminal justice system that he said isn't putting away the city's most dangerous offenders for long enough periods. `Until we have real truth in sentencing and hold these offenders accountable, this will be the unfortunate reality in the city of Chicago.' '' According to an article in the Washington Post, April 2 of this year, ``violence is occurring at levels unseen for years [in Chicago]. In the first quarter of 2016, 141 people were killed, up from 82 last year, according to police department data. The number of shootings surged to 677 from 359 a year earlier. The city is on track to have more than 500 killings this year, which would make this just the third year since 2004 that Chicago topped that figure.'' Some say we have too many people in prison. We have heard that. It is certainly our responsibility, in part, in Congress, to set sentencing laws that are smart, that protect the public, don't put too many people in jail, and strike the right balance. In the early to mid-1980s, Congress passed, in a bipartisan, overwhelming vote, mandatory minimum sentences and sentencing guidelines. They allowed dangerous people to be denied bail on appeal. They allowed people who made frivolous appeals--for the judge to assert that there was no substantial basis for the appeal and he could leave them in jail while they made their appeals because too many people were filing for appeals just to stay out of jail and committed crimes while they were out. All of these are great reforms. They are now under systemic attack. During that entire period of time, the crime rate in America went down. The murder rate in the late nineties was half what it was in 1980. How many good people are alive today because of this improvement in law enforcement? We ended the revolving door, where people were arrested, released, arrested. They came in another time and they are arrested and then they would get out and murder somebody. It was happening all the time. We didn't have the jail capacity to put the people in jail. We didn't have enough police to deal with the surging crime rate. When you have 20-, 30-, 40-percent increases in crime, you are talking about doubling the crime and murder rate in America in 2 or 3 years, after we spent 20 years bringing it down by half. We have to be sure that what we are doing, colleagues, is smart, and we are not signing death warrants for thousands of American innocent citizens. Well, what is the prison situation today? Is the population going up? According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the rate of imprisonment in the United States is at its lowest in a decade. The Federal prison population--195,914 as of May 12, 2016--is at its lowest level since 2006. Since 2013, the Federal prison population has decreased by over 20,000, and it is projected to continue downward. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the population is projected to drop another 10,000 this year, which will bring it to its lowest levels since 2005. The Bureau of Prisons, which houses prisoners, ``projects that the inmate population will continue to decline for the next couple of years, particularly as a result of retroactive changes to sentencing guidelines.'' Indeed, the 46,276 Federal drug trafficking inmates made eligible for early release comprise 25 percent of the current prison population. Admissions to Federal prisons have declined every year since 2011 and will likely decline further due to the Obama administration's policy directing prosecutors not to charge certain criminal offenses. I don't think this Congress has a duty to confirm everyone who is appointed by the President. We know the President has hostility toward prisons. He has directed his Attorney General to reduce prison populations, and that is happening. He has directed the Bureau of Prisons to participate in this. He has directed the Attorney General and the Attorney General has agreed and issued policy that rejects Attorney General Thornburgh's policies when I was a U.S. attorney. Basically, the Thornburgh policy was, if a person used a gun during a crime, a bank robbery, or drug dealing, they were required, under the law, to get an additional 5 years' penalty in addition because the goal was to deter people from carrying guns during the criminal act, therefore, having fewer people killed in this country. It actually worked. In my opinion, it was part of the reason for the decline in the murder rate, clearly. You were required to charge them because the law said, if you carried a gun, you must get 5 years in addition to the other penalties. Now the Attorney General tells everybody: Well, prosecutors, you don't have to charge that; in fact, we don't want you to charge too much on these kinds of cases. As a result, the prosecutions are down, drug prosecutions are down 21 percent, and sentencing is down too. When I asked the Attorney General why the prosecutions of these cases are down so much, she said they are prosecuting bigger cases. I have to say that for the last 50 years, that is the excuse that prosecutors use for having a decline in statistics. They say: Well, we are working bigger cases. But regardless if you are working bigger cases, why are the sentencing numbers down? Presumably, she is saying: We are prosecuting more serious criminals, but the sentences are going down. We are seeing from the prosecutorial end a significant retrenchment or backing off of strong prosecution policy. A judge who gets a lifetime appointment and is no longer accountable to the American people--or anyone else, for that matter--is not entitled to confirmation if we have doubts about the ability over the years to treat police fairly and protect the public from serious criminals. Certainly, it does not send a positive message to police and the community in Baltimore, where she will hear cases if confirmed. Last year was the deadliest year in Baltimore's history--344 murders and countless crimes against persons and property. I believe Ms. Xinis's record demonstrates such a lack of understanding of the reality of law enforcement and the duty of our whole criminal justice system to protect the public as to disqualify her from the Federal bench. [[Page S2804]] That is why I will oppose the nomination. I do not believe she lacks the personal qualities or the integrity needed to be a judge or be a successful person throughout her life, whatever job she holds. She certainly has many admirers. I am not questioning that, but her record, as I have discussed, indicates an approach to law enforcement that does not justify the support of a lifetime appointment. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2799-S2804] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ZIKA VIRUS Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 3 months ago President Barack Obama asked this Congress for funding to address a public health emergency: combating the Zika Virus. I am pleased that this week, 14 weeks after his request, we are going to respond. We are not responding in full. The President asked for $1.9 billion to address this serious public health challenge. We are not responding without some theatrics and posturing first, but we are going to vote on some amendments this week, and it is about time. It has been 14 weeks since representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health testified at the Senate Appropriations Committee on the dire need for immediate action to combat the Zika virus. I visited the Centers for Disease Control about 14 weeks ago. By then, they had been able to verify that the tissue samples from miscarriages and other serious health problems coming in from Brazil were linked to the Zika Virus. So there was no question that these mosquitoes carrying this virus had serious public health consequences-- so serious that the Centers for Disease Control dedicated 1,000 staffers to deal with this issue. That was about 12 or 14 weeks ago. The President used his authority to come to Congress and say: We have a public health emergency; treat it like it is an emergency. Here we are 14 weeks later getting around to discussing it. When I think back in times of American history when Congress has been called on to respond to an emergency, there have been amazing examples where partisanship was set aside and people said: In the interest of America, we need to act and act now. Whether we are talking about mobilizing for a war, whether we are talking about responding to terrorism, we have done it. We can do it. This time we have failed. We have failed for 14 weeks. In that period of time, 1,200 Americans in 44 States, Washington, DC, and 3 U.S. territories, including over 110 pregnant women, have contracted Zika. Six more have contracted Guillain-Barre, an autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis and death. Recently, the first Zika-caused death and the first Zika-related microcephaly cases were reported in Puerto Rico. In my State of Illinois, 16 people have tested positive for Zika, including at least 3 pregnant women. Over the past few months, we have learned more about Zika and how dangerous it can be. We now know it is carried by two types of mosquitoes. We now know it is linked to serious neurological damage and birth defects in children. We now know it can be sexually transmitted. We also know that the mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus thrive in the warm summer months, which is why this action should have been taken long ago and must be taken this week. The best way to fight a public health threat such as Zika is to have a strong, stable public health infrastructure in place. That is what the President asked for. That means reliable and stable funding year after year. Our public health agencies have to be viewed as the first line of defense, just as we view the Pentagon as the first line of defense when it comes to military and terrorist threats. Our public health agencies are the first line of defense when we are speaking of Ebola, the Zika virus, and a variety of other challenges that could literally threaten the health and lives of innocent Americans. We must ensure robust and stable funding for agencies like the Centers for Disease Control. These invasive problems can pop up at any time. We can't rally to each and every occurrence after it happens; we have to be prepared. The Centers for Disease Control is not only the best, it is the best in the world, but it cannot operate without adequate funding. The National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine right now to protect all of us from the Zika virus. That is the answer, but it takes time--a year. We should have been moving on it sooner. We must provide critical resources to the Food and Drug Administration. Their reviewers are responsible for ensuring that any Zika treatments or vaccines are safe and effective, and in order to ensure the safety of those vaccines and treatments, they have to be clinically tested. For years we have heard congressional Republicans rail against Federal spending and even embrace the notion of a sequester--a blind across-the-board cut. Case in point: Over the past few months, we have heard Republicans protest, stall, and push back on providing funding to help combat the Zika virus. There have been a variety of excuses for their delay, but the outcome has always been the same: We have lost time in responding to this public health emergency. For years, those of us on this side of the aisle have been arguing that this approach--one of starving funding and endless delays--is shortsighted and irresponsible. Yes, we must be good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars, but I would argue that there is no better use of the taxpayers' dollars than investments in public health--investments in the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Food and Drug Administration. These are investments that prepare our Nation for the unforeseen, such as Zika or Ebola, but they are also investments that help us prepare for the foreseen situations that Americans face every day, such as Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's, and diabetes. That is why I introduced the American Cures Act--legislation that would provide our Federal health research agencies reliable and robust funding increases every year into the future. We are not going to win a war against Zika, Ebola, Alzheimer's, or cancer if our response is tepid, delayed, watered down, or subject to the whims of political fate. Big budget cuts make a good talking point in a speech somewhere, but the results can be devastating. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee to find a path forward to address the funding of these critical Federal health agencies. There is more to do, and we must do it together. If we don't do it together, we will pay a heavy price. This week we will take up the issue. We will be voting on three Zika- related amendments this week. The first, offered by Senator Nelson of Florida, is one that I fully support. It would fulfill the President's request by providing the $1.9 billion in needed funding to ensure an immediate and comprehensive response to Zika. We need to treat this public health emergency like a public health emergency. Senator Nelson's amendment would ensure that the CDC has the money they need to support States in conducting surveillance, vector control, emergency communications, and research. It would ensure that the National Institutes of Health has the money to develop this vaccine, and it would ensure that USAID has the money they need to build up a global health response to Zika. [[Page S2800]] I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Nelson amendment. It would provide the United States, as well as pregnant women in many affected countries, with the very best chance of minimizing the damage done by the Zika virus. Let's not be penny wise and pound foolish. Cutting back on this money for pregnant women and running the risk that a baby is born with a lifetime of medical challenges and expenses is not a way to save money; it is a disaster for the family and a disaster for our budget. Then comes the second amendment, offered by Senator Cornyn of Texas. This is a misguided amendment. I urge my colleagues to defeat it. Senator Cornyn's amendment would provide a portion of the funding needed to adequately respond to the Zika virus. He picked the number $1.1 billion and said: Let's take the money out of the Prevention and Public Health Fund for America--money that is currently being invested to deal with other health challenges around our country. In order to deal with the Zika virus, Senator Cornyn would take money away from other efforts to keep Americans healthy. The prevention fund accounts for 12 percent--nearly $900 million--of the Centers for Disease Control's core public health efforts, such as lead poisoning prevention, breast and cervical cancer screening, and tobacco prevention and control. Think about that for a second. Senator Cornyn of Texas wants to take the money out of those areas--legitimate public health concerns--and put it in Zika. He is going to move some of the pieces around on the chessboard in the hope of moving the right one. Sadly, it will endanger innocent people. There is something else to be considered. His amount is $1.1 billion, and the President asked for $1.9 billion. For some reason, Senator Cornyn believes that we can reduce the threat of the Zika virus by 40 percent on the floor of the Senate. I don't buy it. This is a public health emergency. Reducing the funding for it from what the President requested by 40 percent is playing Russian roulette with innocent lives across America and around the world. Senator Cornyn's amendment cuts base funding that would ordinarily be provided to the Centers for Disease Control. We are also dealing with lead poisoning issues across America, which was yesterday's front-page story in the Chicago Tribune. All of the lead testing around my State of Illinois finds that areas you wouldn't dream of--the suburbs of Chicago, including some of the wealthier suburbs of Chicago--sadly have too much lead in the water. We know that after what happened in Flint, we have to take it seriously. The impact on innocent children is obvious. Cutting back on funding for that to pay for the Zika virus is robbing Peter to pay Paul. Lastly, we have an amendment that will be offered by Senator Blunt. It is like Senator Cornyn's approach in that it would only provide $1.1 billion, and I take exception to that number. As I said, it is 40 percent less than what the President believes is needed for this emergency, but it would not cut the money out of the prevention fund, so that is a positive thing to say about the Blunt amendment over the Cornyn amendment. This amendment is an improvement, but still, it is important for us to adequately fund public health defense for innocent Americans. When Dr. Frieden of the CDC tells us how much the CDC needs to fight Zika, I trust the doctor. I do not believe we should second-guess his approach, and I don't believe we should provide the Centers for Disease Control with less money than what Dr. Frieden says is needed. That said, I appreciate that Senator Blunt is trying. I hope the initial amendment by Senator Nelson passes. That is the responsible amendment to deal with the public health emergency. We have seen Zika coming for months. We had the administration's detailed, comprehensive plan of action sitting up here for over 3 months. The time to act is way overdue. It is my hope that the Senate will finally approve Zika funding this week and that House Republicans will stop their stalling as well and get to work and do the same. We have lost enough time already. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share some remarks and ask unanimous consent that I be allowed such time as I may consume. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Durbin's comments, and I believe there is clear bipartisan support for dealing with the Zika virus. And something will be done on that, but make no mistake-- there is a disagreement, and our colleagues on the Democratic side, as they always do, just want to add whatever new expense comes up during the year to the deficit of the United States of America. There are many ways we can save money to pay for new expenditures, and that is what Senator Cornyn is talking about. He wants to have it paid-for so we don't add more debt. You say: How can that be? Well, we are already in debt. This year we borrowed approximately $540 billion to fund the government. We spent $4 trillion and we borrowed $540 billion of that. That is a very large number. It is unsustainable, and it is getting worse. We have to start paying for things that we want to do around here and make some choices and set some priorities. That is the entire dispute about this matter, if you want to know the truth about it. There is no way we can't find the money to fund this Zika challenge--sufficient funds to do that--within the spending we already have. NOMINATION OF PAULA XINIS Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to the nomination of Paula Xinis to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. By all accounts, she is a nice person and has a number of admirers. I don't question her integrity. I had an exchange with her at the Judiciary Committee hearing when she came before the committee. I think this nominee has perhaps the most hostile record toward police of any I have seen in a long time. Her background is troubling to me, and I believe it justifies us not allowing her to have a lifetime appointment where she is unaccountable to anyone as she conducts her daily duties involving, on a very frequent basis, the appearance of police before her in criminal cases of all kinds. She would even hear cases against police officers for misconduct that may come before her over her career. I was a prosecutor for almost 15 years in Federal court before Federal judges. I was blessed to appear before Federal judges of high quality who gave the prosecutor a fair trial and gave the defendant a fair trial, and that is what we are looking for. I am aware of a lot of Federal judges who have a clear bias against law enforcement and have made the communities less safe, made prosecuting a nightmare, and I don't believe it is good for the legal system. There is nothing you can do about it. A judge can declare that the evidence is insufficient to convict on his or her own motion which nobody can appeal. That is the final word even though a jury, had they been able to hear the case, might have found otherwise. Yesterday was Peace Officers Memorial Day, and this week is Police Week. We take special occasion each year to remember the service and sacrifice of law enforcement officers and their indispensable role in ensuring law and order in our cities and towns throughout the country. Too often when something goes wrong on the streets today, the media is quick to point their fingers at the police, and that is why we have an impartial justice system--so that the facts can come out in open court. In my experience, when those facts do come out--and I have had the duty of prosecuting police officers--many more times than not, we learn that the police did everything they could according to the procedures and that the complaints we heard about in the media and through others are not accurate. That is what the facts show us time and time again. It is critical that we have judges who respect the rights of the accused but also respect the role of law enforcement and the dangers they face on a daily basis. We have a nominee for the Federal court in Maryland before us, and every police officer in the country needs to know where she stands and how she approaches the duties, responsibilities, [[Page S2801]] and requirements of the police and how she approaches law enforcement. Will she give them a fair hearing? Aren't they entitled to that? Ms. Paula Xinis worked as a Federal public defender for the District of Maryland for 13 years; that is, she was on a paid defender's staff who defended the criminals who were being prosecuted in Federal court, those accused for a whole lot of crimes. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a perfectly honorable profession, and I certainly want to emphasize that. For 6 of those 13 years, she simultaneously served as a complaint examiner in the Office of Police Complaints for the District of Columbia here in DC. During the course of her work there, she heard complaints against police officers for conduct as part of their duties. She heard six complaints, and in every one of those cases, every single one, she found against the police officers. It troubled me, and I asked her some questions about it. In one of the cases, an officer arrested a man who was loitering amidst a group of individuals outside a grocery store while talking on his cell phone. When he was asked to move along, he refused to do so. Then the man became belligerent and repeatedly swore and cursed at the police officer. The officer eventually arrested the man for disorderly conduct. On the panel, Ms. Xinis concluded that the police had harassed the man and found the police officer guilty of misconduct. When I asked her about this decision at her confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee, she said she didn't even know what consequences this finding might have on the career of a police officer as a result of having this on their record. In 2011, Ms. Xinis began work with her current 11-attorney law firm in Baltimore, where she focuses her practice emphasis on lawsuits against the police. According to her firm's Web site, she and two of her colleagues recently settled a $5 million police brutality lawsuit. Notably, her firm also represented the family of Freddie Gray, Jr., the 25-year-old man who was arrested on April 12, 2015, for possessing an illegal switchblade and who subsequently tragically died in police custody, causing riots in Baltimore, if my colleagues recall. On September 8, 2015, the suit against the city and the police department, in which her firm represented the plaintiff, settled for $6.4 million. This may have been a totally justified settlement. I certainly believe that any death in the custody of a police officer by any accused is entitled to and requires a thorough investigation. But in a big city like Baltimore, when there is civil unrest and huge public attention, cities are under political, if not legal, pressure to reach some sort of financial settlement. This was a tragic case. The details were disputed. But it appears that some of the facts were not clear, certainly. The point is, Ms. Xinis has built a career of dealing with lawsuits against police and police departments and dealing with complaints against the police. In every complaint case she heard, she ruled against the police, which, frankly, makes me uneasy, as it does many law enforcement officers. When a lawyer sits as a complaint examiner in a case involving alleged police misconduct, the examiner--the judge, almost, in that case--should know and understand the reality of police work and what our people have to do every day to defend us from crime. I asked her about her findings that the arrest of a loud, cursing loiterer outside a store was police harassment. In other words, the cursing loiterer was OK, but the police officer was wrong. I would think that someone who has spent their entire professional career in this arena would be familiar with some of the concepts and procedures in policing in cities around the country today. For example, broken windows policing is well known. I think most people know what broken windows policing is. It is a short-hand way to describe a policy that originally grew and became predominant in New York City under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and many believe it saved New York City. Crime was surging, disorder was about, the city's financial status was at risk, and they started a systematic smart method of policing, and the murder rate is less than half of what it was in New York City. The entire city has been transformed. So here she is judging police officers about how to handle confrontations on the street and how to make our communities safer. Shouldn't she know about these things? Broken windows policing suggests that when law enforcement consistently enforces the law in cases involving minor crimes--not just big crimes but even minor crimes--that consistency helps to prevent major crimes. It is proven to work. It is a major trend. Virtually every city in America does it. Yes, we have people who are out on the streets causing trouble or risks, and they get their backs up and complain when anybody says anything to them. Police officers have to use judgment. But this police officer, to me, did what one would normally expect him to do. He certainly didn't need to be charged and convicted of harassment. Her statement that she did not know what ``broken windows'' was and was not familiar with it I think evidenced a real lack of understanding. There is concern about this appointment by people who have to deal with this every day. Here is a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police, the Baltimore City lodge, signed by Lieutenant Gene Ryan, President. Again, this is the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police: On behalf of almost 5,000 members of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #3, I write this letter in extreme opposition to the appointment of Paula Xinis as a United States District Judge in the Federal District Court system. While on paper, Ms. Xinis appears to be a highly qualified criminal attorney, our membership is urgently concerned about her obvious disdain for the law enforcement profession as expressed time and again through the various court appearances in which she has represented citizens claiming harm caused by police personnel. In fact, her current partnership in the Baltimore firm of Murphy, Falcon, & Murphy itself is of concern as this is a firm well known in our area for hostility toward our profession and our members and, as a result, we question the ability of Ms. Xinis to remain impartial in any Federal cases involving law enforcement. Senators, we respectfully request that you give consideration to our request to deny the appointment of Paula Xinis to the Federal bench at this time. I also have a letter from the Maryland State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, President Ismael Vincent Canales. He writes: As President of the Maryland Fraternal Order of Police and on behalf of over twenty-thousand active and retired law enforcement officers throughout the State of Maryland, I respectfully request that members of the U.S. Senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of Paula Xinis as a Judge to the United States District Court of Maryland. I believe that Ms. Xinis at this time fails to have the requisite temperament and ability to be fair and impartial on matters that directly affect law enforcement. And he goes on. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two letters be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Fraternal Order of Police, Baltimore City Lodge No. 3, Baltimore, MD, May 16, 2016. To All Members of the United States Senate: On behalf of the almost 5,000 members of the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #3, I write this letter in extreme opposition to the appointment of Paula Xinis as a United States District Judge in the Federal District Court system. While, on paper, Ms. Xinis appears to be a highly qualified criminal attorney, our membership is urgently concerned about her obvious disdain for the law enforcement profession as expressed time and again through the various court appearances in which she has represented citizens claiming harm caused by police personnel. In fact, her current partnership in the Baltimore law firm of Murphy, Falcon & Murphy itself is of concern as this is a firm well known in our area for hostility toward our profession and our members and, as a result, we question the ability of Ms. Xinis to remain impartial in any Federal cases involving law enforcement. Senators, we respectfully request that you give consideration to our request to deny the appointment of Paula Xinis to the Federal Bench at this time, and any time In the future. Most sincerely, Lt. Gene Ryan, President, Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #3. [[Page S2802]] ____ Maryland State Lodge, Fraternal Order of Police, Baltimore, MD, May 16, 2016. Hon. Jeff Sessions, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Jeff Sessions: As President of the Maryland Fraternal Order of Police, and on behalf of the over twenty- thousand active and retired law enforcement officers throughout the State of Maryland, I respectfully request that the members of the United States Senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of Paula Xinis as a Judge to the United States District Court of Maryland. After careful review and consideration, I believe that Ms. Xinis at this time fails to have the requisite temperament and ability to be fair and impartial on matters that directly affect law enforcement. Based on prior and recent experience, Ms. Xinis has shown a clear bias towards law enforcement which began in her position as a complaint examiner in the Office of Police Complaints for the District of Columbia and culminated with her involvement in the civil suit surrounding the Freddie Gray Case in Baltimore City, MD. Ms. Xinis is clearly a consummate advocate which we commend her for. However, at this time, I do not believe that she has displayed throughout her professional career a sufficient ability to equitably apply the law. It is for these reasons that I respectfully request that the Senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of Paula Xinis to the United States District Court of Maryland. Sincerely, Vince Canales. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Federal judges decide cases every day that have a significant real world impact on our criminal justice system--sometimes good, sometimes bad. Let me point out this case. It gives an insight into the kinds of things I saw every day as a prosecutor, and it is happening every day right now in courts all over America. Here is the case before United States District Judge Royce C. Lamberth. He denied a request by the prosecutor for early release of two top associates of Rayful Edmond III, a notorious drug kingpin in Washington, DC. I think they made a movie about him or a film about him, one of the most notorious gang leaders around. The Washington Post described Judge Lamberth's astonishment when the U.S. Attorney did not object to the drug felon's request for early release. Quote: The judge rebuked the Office of acting United States attorney Vincent H. Cohen Jr., of the District, saying prosecutors did not give due weight to the criminal history of Butler, 52, the Los Angeles-based cocaine broker and partner of D.C. drug lord Rayful Edmond III, and Jones, 58, one of four top armed enforcers of Edmond's violent trafficking network. The group imported as much as 1,700 pounds of Colombian cocaine a month. That is almost a ton a month. That is the largest amount I have ever seen. I thought the biggest case I had ever seen was 600 pounds flown in on about 20 plane loads over several months. This is 1,700 pounds a month. Edmond's organization enabled drug addiction on a scale that until then ``was unprecedented and largely unimaginable'' in Washington, Lamberth wrote, and the harm the defendants caused ``is immeasurable and in many cases irreversible.'' ``To put it bluntly, the court is surprised and disappointed by the United States Attorney's decision to not oppose the present motions,'' Lamberth said. Quote: ``The court struggles to understand how the government could condone the release of Butler and Jones, each convicted of high-level, sophisticated and violent drug trafficking offenses.'' So that is a Federal judge doing their duty. I am not sure where Ms. Xinis would be on this. Contrast that with many courts across the country that are currently rubberstamping motions for early release for Federal drug trafficking felons under the Sentencing Commission's reductions to the sentencing guidelines that have already occurred and that are impacting the prison population significantly, as we will see. That is according to an October 2015 article in the Los Angeles Times entitled ``The face of the federal prison release: A heavy dose of meth, crack, and cocaine.'' This is what the article says: A federal analysis of the expected impact of the first wave of those approved for early release shows 663 prisoners from California had filed for shorter sentences as of late July. Federal judges denied 92 of them. It looks as though six out of seven were granted. According to an October 2015 article regarding offenders released in the Pittsburgh area, the U.S. Attorney's Office there ``erred on the side of granting'' the motions. So the U.S. attorney's office is not defending the legitimate, original sentence that was imposed. They walk in and just don't--if there is any doubt about it, they just go along with the prisoner's request. According to a November 2015 article entitled ``Upstate NY gang members on secret list of 6,000 freed early from prison,'' it is happening in New York too. Quote: In the Northern District of New York, the [Court, prosecutors, and defense attorneys] agreed on the eligibility of almost all of the inmates, and disagreed on only five cases that became subject to litigation. . . . Of those five cases, a judge ordered early release for three and rejected one. A fifth case is pending. So out of all the cases, only one was rejected. Judges have a duty to make sure that they--they don't have to take everything the prosecutor says. The prosecutor sometimes asks for a higher sentence than a judge wants to give, but a judge is equally required to reject a prosecutor's failure to oppose unjustified reductions. This is, frankly, President Obama's policy, and the policy of the Attorney General, whom he has appointed--Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder before her--basically to cut people's sentences that have been lawfully imposed throughout this country. In my opinion, it is impacting public safety and will continue to do so in the future. Judges must protect the rights of the accused, absolutely, and give them a fair hearing, as they are required to do, but they must give the people, the police, and the prosecutor the right to a fair trial also. These kind of cases cause concern about who is protecting the public. Would Judge Xinis be more likely to follow the pattern of Judge Royce Lamberth in saying no or go along with these other cases? Over the past year, our law enforcement officers across the country have been shot at, assaulted, and murdered, too often simply because they wear a badge. Last year we lost 123 police officers--35 in the first 4 months of 2016. Violent crime and murders have increased across the country at alarming rates. Let me share with my colleagues some of the things we are seeing in trends in violent crime. Recently, the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association, a long-established group, called an emergency meeting to deal with the numbers I am going to share with you today. The numbers I will quote represent the percentage of increase in total murders in the first quarter of this year, 2016, over the first quarter of 2015: Las Vegas, 82 percent increase; Dallas, TX, 73 percent increase; Chicago, 70 percent; Jacksonville, FL, 67 percent; Newark, NJ, 60 percent increase; Miami-Dade, 38 percent; Los Angeles, 33 percent; Atlanta, 20 percent; Baltimore, 10 percent. These are substantial increases in crime. The FBI Director, Mr. Comey, a long-term experienced law officer, who served at the top of the Department of Justice as a prosecutor, recently said he believes the pushback on police officers--this trend of attacking and blaming police officers--has caused some drawback and reluctance of police officers to take on situations like the guy at the store standing out front that was cursing the police officer. Properly handled, those kinds of things reduce crime. They help violence not to start. Once it gets started, bad things can happen. Oftentimes, somebody gets killed. It is not like on television where somebody punches somebody and they get up and walk away and laugh about it. A good punch breaks teeth, jaws, and can kill. This increase in murder rates is significant, and we have to be aware of it. Lives are at stake, many innocent people. If we get off the right path, we will lose lives as a result of criminal conduct. Think about some of the cases, such as that of Kate Steinle in California, who was out with her father and was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported multiple times. Judges have to know this isn't a game. We don't want to put anybody in jail, but if we don't maintain order in cities, chaos can result, innocent people will die, and prosperity will be reduced. According to the FBI statistics released just this year, the number of [[Page S2803]] violent crimes committed across the country was up in the first half of 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. The number of murders, rapes, assaults, and robberies were up all over the first 6 months of 2015. There was a 6.2-percent increase in murder. Violent crime across America rose 5.3 percent in large cities, and overall violent crime increased 1.7 percent, an increase that followed two consecutive years of decline. In my judgment, what I am seeing is this is a long-term trend. I think we will continue to see this increase. I wish it weren't so, but I am afraid it is. According to statistics released Friday by the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association, the number of homicides increased in the first months of 2016 in more than two dozen major cities. The Washington Post reports ``the numbers were particularly grim for a handful of places--Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas and Las Vegas--where the numbers of homicides increased in the first three months of 2016. . . . '' The article goes on to quote FBI Director Comey. He said: I was very worried about it last fall, and I am in many ways more worried, because the numbers are not only going up, they're continuing to go up in most of those cities faster than they were going up last year. Something is happening. I don't know what the answer is, but holy cow, do we have a problem. He also said before our committee that he remembered the last crimewave in the seventies and the sixties and how enforcement brought it down dramatically. He said we don't want to forget the lessons we learned previously. Director Comey has further suggested that possible explanations for this spike in violent crime included gang and drug violence. He has also suggested that greater scrutiny of police as they do their duty has possibly changed the way officers and communities interact, something he calls the ``viral video effect,'' which he believes leads to less aggressive policing. Less aggressive policing means more crime and more deaths. On Mother's Day weekend in Chicago, more than 50 people were shot between Friday afternoon and early Monday. During a 3\1/2\-hour period early Saturday, one man was killed and 14 others wounded, as the Chicago Tribune said, ``the equivalent of someone being shot every 14 minutes.'' According to the Tribune, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson ``saved his harshest criticism for a criminal justice system that he said isn't putting away the city's most dangerous offenders for long enough periods. `Until we have real truth in sentencing and hold these offenders accountable, this will be the unfortunate reality in the city of Chicago.' '' According to an article in the Washington Post, April 2 of this year, ``violence is occurring at levels unseen for years [in Chicago]. In the first quarter of 2016, 141 people were killed, up from 82 last year, according to police department data. The number of shootings surged to 677 from 359 a year earlier. The city is on track to have more than 500 killings this year, which would make this just the third year since 2004 that Chicago topped that figure.'' Some say we have too many people in prison. We have heard that. It is certainly our responsibility, in part, in Congress, to set sentencing laws that are smart, that protect the public, don't put too many people in jail, and strike the right balance. In the early to mid-1980s, Congress passed, in a bipartisan, overwhelming vote, mandatory minimum sentences and sentencing guidelines. They allowed dangerous people to be denied bail on appeal. They allowed people who made frivolous appeals--for the judge to assert that there was no substantial basis for the appeal and he could leave them in jail while they made their appeals because too many people were filing for appeals just to stay out of jail and committed crimes while they were out. All of these are great reforms. They are now under systemic attack. During that entire period of time, the crime rate in America went down. The murder rate in the late nineties was half what it was in 1980. How many good people are alive today because of this improvement in law enforcement? We ended the revolving door, where people were arrested, released, arrested. They came in another time and they are arrested and then they would get out and murder somebody. It was happening all the time. We didn't have the jail capacity to put the people in jail. We didn't have enough police to deal with the surging crime rate. When you have 20-, 30-, 40-percent increases in crime, you are talking about doubling the crime and murder rate in America in 2 or 3 years, after we spent 20 years bringing it down by half. We have to be sure that what we are doing, colleagues, is smart, and we are not signing death warrants for thousands of American innocent citizens. Well, what is the prison situation today? Is the population going up? According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the rate of imprisonment in the United States is at its lowest in a decade. The Federal prison population--195,914 as of May 12, 2016--is at its lowest level since 2006. Since 2013, the Federal prison population has decreased by over 20,000, and it is projected to continue downward. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the population is projected to drop another 10,000 this year, which will bring it to its lowest levels since 2005. The Bureau of Prisons, which houses prisoners, ``projects that the inmate population will continue to decline for the next couple of years, particularly as a result of retroactive changes to sentencing guidelines.'' Indeed, the 46,276 Federal drug trafficking inmates made eligible for early release comprise 25 percent of the current prison population. Admissions to Federal prisons have declined every year since 2011 and will likely decline further due to the Obama administration's policy directing prosecutors not to charge certain criminal offenses. I don't think this Congress has a duty to confirm everyone who is appointed by the President. We know the President has hostility toward prisons. He has directed his Attorney General to reduce prison populations, and that is happening. He has directed the Bureau of Prisons to participate in this. He has directed the Attorney General and the Attorney General has agreed and issued policy that rejects Attorney General Thornburgh's policies when I was a U.S. attorney. Basically, the Thornburgh policy was, if a person used a gun during a crime, a bank robbery, or drug dealing, they were required, under the law, to get an additional 5 years' penalty in addition because the goal was to deter people from carrying guns during the criminal act, therefore, having fewer people killed in this country. It actually worked. In my opinion, it was part of the reason for the decline in the murder rate, clearly. You were required to charge them because the law said, if you carried a gun, you must get 5 years in addition to the other penalties. Now the Attorney General tells everybody: Well, prosecutors, you don't have to charge that; in fact, we don't want you to charge too much on these kinds of cases. As a result, the prosecutions are down, drug prosecutions are down 21 percent, and sentencing is down too. When I asked the Attorney General why the prosecutions of these cases are down so much, she said they are prosecuting bigger cases. I have to say that for the last 50 years, that is the excuse that prosecutors use for having a decline in statistics. They say: Well, we are working bigger cases. But regardless if you are working bigger cases, why are the sentencing numbers down? Presumably, she is saying: We are prosecuting more serious criminals, but the sentences are going down. We are seeing from the prosecutorial end a significant retrenchment or backing off of strong prosecution policy. A judge who gets a lifetime appointment and is no longer accountable to the American people--or anyone else, for that matter--is not entitled to confirmation if we have doubts about the ability over the years to treat police fairly and protect the public from serious criminals. Certainly, it does not send a positive message to police and the community in Baltimore, where she will hear cases if confirmed. Last year was the deadliest year in Baltimore's history--344 murders and countless crimes against persons and property. I believe Ms. Xinis's record demonstrates such a lack of understanding of the reality of law enforcement and the duty of our whole criminal justice system to protect the public as to disqualify her from the Federal bench. [[Page S2804]] That is why I will oppose the nomination. I do not believe she lacks the personal qualities or the integrity needed to be a judge or be a successful person throughout her life, whatever job she holds. She certainly has many admirers. I am not questioning that, but her record, as I have discussed, indicates an approach to law enforcement that does not justify the support of a lifetime appointment. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_176.csv,42247,42247,42312,"[congressional record volume 162, number 77 (monday, may 16, 2016)] [senate] [pages s2799-s2804] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] zika virus mr. durbin. madam president, 3 months ago president barack obama asked this congress for funding to address a public health emergency: combating the zika virus. i am pleased that this week, 14 weeks after his request, we are going to respond. we are not responding in full. the president asked for $1.9 billion to address this serious public health challenge. we are not responding without some theatrics and posturing first, but we are going to vote on some amendments this week, and it is about time. it has been 14 weeks since representatives from the centers for disease control and prevention and the national institutes of health testified at the senate appropriations committee on the dire need for immediate action to combat the zika virus. i visited the centers for disease control about 14 weeks ago. by then, they had been able to verify that the tissue samples from miscarriages and other serious health problems coming in from brazil were linked to the zika virus. so there was no question that these mosquitoes carrying this virus had serious public health consequences-- so serious that the centers for disease control dedicated 1,000 staffers to deal with this issue. that was about 12 or 14 weeks ago. the president used his authority to come to congress and say: we have a public health emergency; treat it like it is an emergency. here we are 14 weeks later getting around to discussing it. when i think back in times of american history when congress has been called on to respond to an emergency, there have been amazing examples where partisanship was set aside and people said: in the interest of america, we need to act and act now. whether we are talking about mobilizing for a war, whether we are talking about responding to terrorism, we have done it. we can do it. this time we have failed. we have failed for 14 weeks. in that period of time, 1,200 americans in 44 states, washington, dc, and 3 u.s. territories, including over 110 pregnant women, have contracted zika. six more have contracted guillain-barre, an autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis and death. recently, the first zika-caused death and the first zika-related microcephaly cases were reported in puerto rico. in my state of illinois, 16 people have tested positive for zika, including at least 3 pregnant women. over the past few months, we have learned more about zika and how dangerous it can be. we now know it is carried by two types of mosquitoes. we now know it is linked to serious neurological damage and birth defects in children. we now know it can be sexually transmitted. we also know that the mosquitoes carrying the zika virus thrive in the warm summer months, which is why this action should have been taken long ago and must be taken this week. the best way to fight a public health threat such as zika is to have a strong, stable public health infrastructure in place. that is what the president asked for. that means reliable and stable funding year after year. our public health agencies have to be viewed as the first line of defense, just as we view the pentagon as the first line of defense when it comes to military and terrorist threats. our public health agencies are the first line of defense when we are speaking of ebola, the zika virus, and a variety of other challenges that could literally threaten the health and lives of innocent americans. we must ensure robust and stable funding for agencies like the centers for disease control. these invasive problems can pop up at any time. we can't rally to each and every occurrence after it happens; we have to be prepared. the centers for disease control is not only the best, it is the best in the world, but it cannot operate without adequate funding. the national institutes of health is working on a vaccine right now to protect all of us from the zika virus. that is the answer, but it takes time--a year. we should have been moving on it sooner. we must provide critical resources to the food and drug administration. their reviewers are responsible for ensuring that any zika treatments or vaccines are safe and effective, and in order to ensure the safety of those vaccines and treatments, they have to be clinically tested. for years we have heard congressional republicans rail against federal spending and even embrace the notion of a sequester--a blind across-the-board cut. case in point: over the past few months, we have heard republicans protest, stall, and push back on providing funding to help combat the zika virus. there have been a variety of excuses for their delay, but the outcome has always been the same: we have lost time in responding to this public health emergency. for years, those of us on this side of the aisle have been arguing that this approach--one of starving funding and endless delays--is shortsighted and irresponsible. yes, we must be good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars, but i would argue that there is no better use of the taxpayers' dollars than investments in public health--investments in the national institutes of health, the centers for disease control, and the food and drug administration. these are investments that prepare our nation for the unforeseen, such as zika or ebola, but they are also investments that help us prepare for the foreseen situations that americans face every day, such as alzheimer's, cancer, parkinson's, and diabetes. that is why i introduced the american cures act--legislation that would provide our federal health research agencies reliable and robust funding increases every year into the future. we are not going to win a war against zika, ebola, alzheimer's, or cancer if our response is tepid, delayed, watered down, or subject to the whims of political fate. big budget cuts make a good talking point in a speech somewhere, but the results can be devastating. i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the senate appropriations committee to find a path forward to address the funding of these critical federal health agencies. there is more to do, and we must do it together. if we don't do it together, we will pay a heavy price. this week we will take up the issue. we will be voting on three zika- related amendments this week. the first, offered by senator nelson of florida, is one that i fully support. it would fulfill the president's request by providing the $1.9 billion in needed funding to ensure an immediate and comprehensive response to zika. we need to treat this public health emergency like a public health emergency. senator nelson's amendment would ensure that the cdc has the money they need to support states in conducting surveillance, vector control, emergency communications, and research. it would ensure that the national institutes of health has the money to develop this vaccine, and it would ensure that usaid has the money they need to build up a global health response to zika. [[page s2800]] i am proud to be a cosponsor of the nelson amendment. it would provide the united states, as well as pregnant women in many affected countries, with the very best chance of minimizing the damage done by the zika virus. let's not be penny wise and pound foolish. cutting back on this money for pregnant women and running the risk that a baby is born with a lifetime of medical challenges and expenses is not a way to save money; it is a disaster for the family and a disaster for our budget. then comes the second amendment, offered by senator cornyn of texas. this is a misguided amendment. i urge my colleagues to defeat it. senator cornyn's amendment would provide a portion of the funding needed to adequately respond to the zika virus. he picked the number $1.1 billion and said: let's take the money out of the prevention and public health fund for america--money that is currently being invested to deal with other health challenges around our country. in order to deal with the zika virus, senator cornyn would take money away from other efforts to keep americans healthy. the prevention fund accounts for 12 percent--nearly $900 million--of the centers for disease control's core public health efforts, such as lead poisoning prevention, breast and cervical cancer screening, and tobacco prevention and control. think about that for a second. senator cornyn of texas wants to take the money out of those areas--legitimate public health concerns--and put it in zika. he is going to move some of the pieces around on the chessboard in the hope of moving the right one. sadly, it will endanger innocent people. there is something else to be considered. his amount is $1.1 billion, and the president asked for $1.9 billion. for some reason, senator cornyn believes that we can reduce the threat of the zika virus by 40 percent on the floor of the senate. i don't buy it. this is a public health emergency. reducing the funding for it from what the president requested by 40 percent is playing russian roulette with innocent lives across america and around the world. senator cornyn's amendment cuts base funding that would ordinarily be provided to the centers for disease control. we are also dealing with lead poisoning issues across america, which was yesterday's front-page story in the chicago tribune. all of the lead testing around my state of illinois finds that areas you wouldn't dream of--the suburbs of chicago, including some of the wealthier suburbs of chicago--sadly have too much lead in the water. we know that after what happened in flint, we have to take it seriously. the impact on innocent children is obvious. cutting back on funding for that to pay for the zika virus is robbing peter to pay paul. lastly, we have an amendment that will be offered by senator blunt. it is like senator cornyn's approach in that it would only provide $1.1 billion, and i take exception to that number. as i said, it is 40 percent less than what the president believes is needed for this emergency, but it would not cut the money out of the prevention fund, so that is a positive thing to say about the blunt amendment over the cornyn amendment. this amendment is an improvement, but still, it is important for us to adequately fund public health defense for innocent americans. when dr. frieden of the cdc tells us how much the cdc needs to fight zika, i trust the doctor. i do not believe we should second-guess his approach, and i don't believe we should provide the centers for disease control with less money than what dr. frieden says is needed. that said, i appreciate that senator blunt is trying. i hope the initial amendment by senator nelson passes. that is the responsible amendment to deal with the public health emergency. we have seen zika coming for months. we had the administration's detailed, comprehensive plan of action sitting up here for over 3 months. the time to act is way overdue. it is my hope that the senate will finally approve zika funding this week and that house republicans will stop their stalling as well and get to work and do the same. we have lost enough time already. i yield the floor. the presiding officer (mr. barrasso). the senator from alabama. mr. sessions. mr. president, i wish to share some remarks and ask unanimous consent that i be allowed such time as i may consume. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. sessions. mr. president, i appreciate senator durbin's comments, and i believe there is clear bipartisan support for dealing with the zika virus. and something will be done on that, but make no mistake-- there is a disagreement, and our colleagues on the democratic side, as they always do, just want to add whatever new expense comes up during the year to the deficit of the united states of america. there are many ways we can save money to pay for new expenditures, and that is what senator cornyn is talking about. he wants to have it paid-for so we don't add more debt. you say: how can that be? well, we are already in debt. this year we borrowed approximately $540 billion to fund the government. we spent $4 trillion and we borrowed $540 billion of that. that is a very large number. it is unsustainable, and it is getting worse. we have to start paying for things that we want to do around here and make some choices and set some priorities. that is the entire dispute about this matter, if you want to know the truth about it. there is no way we can't find the money to fund this zika challenge--sufficient funds to do that--within the spending we already have. nomination of paula xinis mr. sessions. mr. president, i wish to speak in opposition to the nomination of paula xinis to the u.s. district court for the district of maryland. by all accounts, she is a nice person and has a number of admirers. i don't question her integrity. i had an exchange with her at the judiciary committee hearing when she came before the committee. i think this nominee has perhaps the most hostile record toward police of any i have seen in a long time. her background is troubling to me, and i believe it justifies us not allowing her to have a lifetime appointment where she is unaccountable to anyone as she conducts her daily duties involving, on a very frequent basis, the appearance of police before her in criminal cases of all kinds. she would even hear cases against police officers for misconduct that may come before her over her career. i was a prosecutor for almost 15 years in federal court before federal judges. i was blessed to appear before federal judges of high quality who gave the prosecutor a fair trial and gave the defendant a fair trial, and that is what we are looking for. i am aware of a lot of federal judges who have a clear bias against law enforcement and have made the communities less safe, made prosecuting a nightmare, and i don't believe it is good for the legal system. there is nothing you can do about it. a judge can declare that the evidence is insufficient to convict on his or her own motion which nobody can appeal. that is the final word even though a jury, had they been able to hear the case, might have found otherwise. yesterday was peace officers memorial day, and this week is police week. we take special occasion each year to remember the service and sacrifice of law enforcement officers and their indispensable role in ensuring law and order in our cities and towns throughout the country. too often when something goes wrong on the streets today, the media is quick to point their fingers at the police, and that is why we have an impartial justice system--so that the facts can come out in open court. in my experience, when those facts do come out--and i have had the duty of prosecuting police officers--many more times than not, we learn that the police did everything they could according to the procedures and that the complaints we heard about in the media and through others are not accurate. that is what the facts show us time and time again. it is critical that we have judges who respect the rights of the accused but also respect the role of law enforcement and the dangers they face on a daily basis. we have a nominee for the federal court in maryland before us, and every police officer in the country needs to know where she stands and how she approaches the duties, responsibilities, [[page s2801]] and requirements of the police and how she approaches law enforcement. will she give them a fair hearing? aren't they entitled to that? ms. paula xinis worked as a federal public defender for the district of maryland for 13 years; that is, she was on a paid defender's staff who defended the criminals who were being prosecuted in federal court, those accused for a whole lot of crimes. there is nothing wrong with that. it is a perfectly honorable profession, and i certainly want to emphasize that. for 6 of those 13 years, she simultaneously served as a complaint examiner in the office of police complaints for the district of columbia here in dc. during the course of her work there, she heard complaints against police officers for conduct as part of their duties. she heard six complaints, and in every one of those cases, every single one, she found against the police officers. it troubled me, and i asked her some questions about it. in one of the cases, an officer arrested a man who was loitering amidst a group of individuals outside a grocery store while talking on his cell phone. when he was asked to move along, he refused to do so. then the man became belligerent and repeatedly swore and cursed at the police officer. the officer eventually arrested the man for disorderly conduct. on the panel, ms. xinis concluded that the police had harassed the man and found the police officer guilty of misconduct. when i asked her about this decision at her confirmation hearing in the judiciary committee, she said she didn't even know what consequences this finding might have on the career of a police officer as a result of having this on their record. in 2011, ms. xinis began work with her current 11-attorney law firm in baltimore, where she focuses her practice emphasis on lawsuits against the police. according to her firm's web site, she and two of her colleagues recently settled a $5 million police brutality lawsuit. notably, her firm also represented the family of freddie gray, jr., the 25-year-old man who was arrested on april 12, 2015, for possessing an illegal switchblade and who subsequently tragically died in police custody, causing riots in baltimore, if my colleagues recall. on september 8, 2015, the suit against the city and the police department, in which her firm represented the plaintiff, settled for $6.4 million. this may have been a totally justified settlement. i certainly believe that any death in the custody of a police officer by any accused is entitled to and requires a thorough investigation. but in a big city like baltimore, when there is civil unrest and huge public attention, cities are under political, if not legal, pressure to reach some sort of financial settlement. this was a tragic case. the details were disputed. but it appears that some of the facts were not clear, certainly. the point is, ms. xinis has built a career of dealing with lawsuits against police and police departments and dealing with complaints against the police. in every complaint case she heard, she ruled against the police, which, frankly, makes me uneasy, as it does many law enforcement officers. when a lawyer sits as a complaint examiner in a case involving alleged police misconduct, the examiner--the judge, almost, in that case--should know and understand the reality of police work and what our people have to do every day to defend us from crime. i asked her about her findings that the arrest of a loud, cursing loiterer outside a store was police harassment. in other words, the cursing loiterer was ok, but the police officer was wrong. i would think that someone who has spent their entire professional career in this arena would be familiar with some of the concepts and procedures in policing in cities around the country today. for example, broken windows policing is well known. i think most people know what broken windows policing is. it is a short-hand way to describe a policy that originally grew and became predominant in new york city under mayor rudy giuliani, and many believe it saved new york city. crime was surging, disorder was about, the city's financial status was at risk, and they started a systematic smart method of policing, and the murder rate is less than half of what it was in new york city. the entire city has been transformed. so here she is judging police officers about how to handle confrontations on the street and how to make our communities safer. shouldn't she know about these things? broken windows policing suggests that when law enforcement consistently enforces the law in cases involving minor crimes--not just big crimes but even minor crimes--that consistency helps to prevent major crimes. it is proven to work. it is a major trend. virtually every city in america does it. yes, we have people who are out on the streets causing trouble or risks, and they get their backs up and complain when anybody says anything to them. police officers have to use judgment. but this police officer, to me, did what one would normally expect him to do. he certainly didn't need to be charged and convicted of harassment. her statement that she did not know what ``broken windows'' was and was not familiar with it i think evidenced a real lack of understanding. there is concern about this appointment by people who have to deal with this every day. here is a letter from the fraternal order of police, the baltimore city lodge, signed by lieutenant gene ryan, president. again, this is the baltimore city fraternal order of police: on behalf of almost 5,000 members of the baltimore city fraternal order of police, lodge #3, i write this letter in extreme opposition to the appointment of paula xinis as a united states district judge in the federal district court system. while on paper, ms. xinis appears to be a highly qualified criminal attorney, our membership is urgently concerned about her obvious disdain for the law enforcement profession as expressed time and again through the various court appearances in which she has represented citizens claiming harm caused by police personnel. in fact, her current partnership in the baltimore firm of murphy, falcon, & murphy itself is of concern as this is a firm well known in our area for hostility toward our profession and our members and, as a result, we question the ability of ms. xinis to remain impartial in any federal cases involving law enforcement. senators, we respectfully request that you give consideration to our request to deny the appointment of paula xinis to the federal bench at this time. i also have a letter from the maryland state lodge of the fraternal order of police, president ismael vincent canales. he writes: as president of the maryland fraternal order of police and on behalf of over twenty-thousand active and retired law enforcement officers throughout the state of maryland, i respectfully request that members of the u.s. senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of paula xinis as a judge to the united states district court of maryland. i believe that ms. xinis at this time fails to have the requisite temperament and ability to be fair and impartial on matters that directly affect law enforcement. and he goes on. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that these two letters be printed in the record. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: fraternal order of police, baltimore city lodge no. 3, baltimore, md, may 16, 2016. to all members of the united states senate: on behalf of the almost 5,000 members of the baltimore city fraternal order of police, lodge #3, i write this letter in extreme opposition to the appointment of paula xinis as a united states district judge in the federal district court system. while, on paper, ms. xinis appears to be a highly qualified criminal attorney, our membership is urgently concerned about her obvious disdain for the law enforcement profession as expressed time and again through the various court appearances in which she has represented citizens claiming harm caused by police personnel. in fact, her current partnership in the baltimore law firm of murphy, falcon & murphy itself is of concern as this is a firm well known in our area for hostility toward our profession and our members and, as a result, we question the ability of ms. xinis to remain impartial in any federal cases involving law enforcement. senators, we respectfully request that you give consideration to our request to deny the appointment of paula xinis to the federal bench at this time, and any time in the future. most sincerely, lt. gene ryan, president, baltimore city fraternal order of police, lodge #3. [[page s2802]] ____ maryland state lodge, fraternal order of police, baltimore, md, may 16, 2016. hon. jeff sessions, senate judiciary committee, washington, dc. dear senator jeff sessions: as president of the maryland fraternal order of police, and on behalf of the over twenty- thousand active and retired law enforcement officers throughout the state of maryland, i respectfully request that the members of the united states senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of paula xinis as a judge to the united states district court of maryland. after careful review and consideration, i believe that ms. xinis at this time fails to have the requisite temperament and ability to be fair and impartial on matters that directly affect law enforcement. based on prior and recent experience, ms. xinis has shown a clear bias towards law enforcement which began in her position as a complaint examiner in the office of police complaints for the district of columbia and culminated with her involvement in the civil suit surrounding the freddie gray case in baltimore city, md. ms. xinis is clearly a consummate advocate which we commend her for. however, at this time, i do not believe that she has displayed throughout her professional career a sufficient ability to equitably apply the law. it is for these reasons that i respectfully request that the senate vote unfavorably on the appointment of paula xinis to the united states district court of maryland. sincerely, vince canales. mr. sessions. mr. president, federal judges decide cases every day that have a significant real world impact on our criminal justice system--sometimes good, sometimes bad. let me point out this case. it gives an insight into the kinds of things i saw every day as a prosecutor, and it is happening every day right now in courts all over america. here is the case before united states district judge royce c. lamberth. he denied a request by the prosecutor for early release of two top associates of rayful edmond iii, a notorious drug kingpin in washington, dc. i think they made a movie about him or a film about him, one of the most notorious gang leaders around. the washington post described judge lamberth's astonishment when the u.s. attorney did not object to the drug felon's request for early release. quote: the judge rebuked the office of acting united states attorney vincent h. cohen jr., of the district, saying prosecutors did not give due weight to the criminal history of butler, 52, the los angeles-based cocaine broker and partner of d.c. drug lord rayful edmond iii, and jones, 58, one of four top armed enforcers of edmond's violent trafficking network. the group imported as much as 1,700 pounds of colombian cocaine a month. that is almost a ton a month. that is the largest amount i have ever seen. i thought the biggest case i had ever seen was 600 pounds flown in on about 20 plane loads over several months. this is 1,700 pounds a month. edmond's organization enabled drug addiction on a scale that until then ``was unprecedented and largely unimaginable'' in washington, lamberth wrote, and the harm the defendants caused ``is immeasurable and in many cases irreversible.'' ``to put it bluntly, the court is surprised and disappointed by the united states attorney's decision to not oppose the present motions,'' lamberth said. quote: ``the court struggles to understand how the government could condone the release of butler and jones, each convicted of high-level, sophisticated and violent drug trafficking offenses.'' so that is a federal judge doing their duty. i am not sure where ms. xinis would be on this. contrast that with many courts across the country that are currently rubberstamping motions for early release for federal drug trafficking felons under the sentencing commission's reductions to the sentencing guidelines that have already occurred and that are impacting the prison population significantly, as we will see. that is according to an october 2015 article in the los angeles times entitled ``the face of the federal prison release: a heavy dose of meth, crack, and cocaine.'' this is what the article says: a federal analysis of the expected impact of the first wave of those approved for early release shows 663 prisoners from california had filed for shorter sentences as of late july. federal judges denied 92 of them. it looks as though six out of seven were granted. according to an october 2015 article regarding offenders released in the pittsburgh area, the u.s. attorney's office there ``erred on the side of granting'' the motions. so the u.s. attorney's office is not defending the legitimate, original sentence that was imposed. they walk in and just don't--if there is any doubt about it, they just go along with the prisoner's request. according to a november 2015 article entitled ``upstate ny gang members on secret list of 6,000 freed early from prison,'' it is happening in new york too. quote: in the northern district of new york, the [court, prosecutors, and defense attorneys] agreed on the eligibility of almost all of the inmates, and disagreed on only five cases that became subject to litigation. . . . of those five cases, a judge ordered early release for three and rejected one. a fifth case is pending. so out of all the cases, only one was rejected. judges have a duty to make sure that they--they don't have to take everything the prosecutor says. the prosecutor sometimes asks for a higher sentence than a judge wants to give, but a judge is equally required to reject a prosecutor's failure to oppose unjustified reductions. this is, frankly, president obama's policy, and the policy of the attorney general, whom he has appointed--loretta lynch and eric holder before her--basically to cut people's sentences that have been lawfully imposed throughout this country. in my opinion, it is impacting public safety and will continue to do so in the future. judges must protect the rights of the accused, absolutely, and give them a fair hearing, as they are required to do, but they must give the people, the police, and the prosecutor the right to a fair trial also. these kind of cases cause concern about who is protecting the public. would judge xinis be more likely to follow the pattern of judge royce lamberth in saying no or go along with these other cases? over the past year, our law enforcement officers across the country have been shot at, assaulted, and murdered, too often simply because they wear a badge. last year we lost 123 police officers--35 in the first 4 months of 2016. violent crime and murders have increased across the country at alarming rates. let me share with my colleagues some of the things we are seeing in trends in violent crime. recently, the major cities chiefs police association, a long-established group, called an emergency meeting to deal with the numbers i am going to share with you today. the numbers i will quote represent the percentage of increase in total murders in the first quarter of this year, 2016, over the first quarter of 2015: las vegas, 82 percent increase; dallas, tx, 73 percent increase; chicago, 70 percent; jacksonville, fl, 67 percent; newark, nj, 60 percent increase; miami-dade, 38 percent; los angeles, 33 percent; atlanta, 20 percent; baltimore, 10 percent. these are substantial increases in crime. the fbi director, mr. comey, a long-term experienced law officer, who served at the top of the department of justice as a prosecutor, recently said he believes the pushback on police officers--this trend of attacking and blaming police officers--has caused some drawback and reluctance of police officers to take on situations like the guy at the store standing out front that was cursing the police officer. properly handled, those kinds of things reduce crime. they help violence not to start. once it gets started, bad things can happen. oftentimes, somebody gets killed. it is not like on television where somebody punches somebody and they get up and walk away and laugh about it. a good punch breaks teeth, jaws, and can kill. this increase in murder rates is significant, and we have to be aware of it. lives are at stake, many innocent people. if we get off the right path, we will lose lives as a result of criminal conduct. think about some of the cases, such as that of kate steinle in california, who was out with her father and was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported multiple times. judges have to know this isn't a game. we don't want to put anybody in jail, but if we don't maintain order in cities, chaos can result, innocent people will die, and prosperity will be reduced. according to the fbi statistics released just this year, the number of [[page s2803]] violent crimes committed across the country was up in the first half of 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. the number of murders, rapes, assaults, and robberies were up all over the first 6 months of 2015. there was a 6.2-percent increase in murder. violent crime across america rose 5.3 percent in large cities, and overall violent crime increased 1.7 percent, an increase that followed two consecutive years of decline. in my judgment, what i am seeing is this is a long-term trend. i think we will continue to see this increase. i wish it weren't so, but i am afraid it is. according to statistics released friday by the major cities chiefs police association, the number of homicides increased in the first months of 2016 in more than two dozen major cities. the washington post reports ``the numbers were particularly grim for a handful of places--chicago, los angeles, dallas and las vegas--where the numbers of homicides increased in the first three months of 2016. . . . '' the article goes on to quote fbi director comey. he said: i was very worried about it last fall, and i am in many ways more worried, because the numbers are not only going up, they're continuing to go up in most of those cities faster than they were going up last year. something is happening. i don't know what the answer is, but holy cow, do we have a problem. he also said before our committee that he remembered the last crimewave in the seventies and the sixties and how enforcement brought it down dramatically. he said we don't want to forget the lessons we learned previously. director comey has further suggested that possible explanations for this spike in violent crime included gang and drug violence. he has also suggested that greater scrutiny of police as they do their duty has possibly changed the way officers and communities interact, something he calls the ``viral video effect,'' which he believes leads to less aggressive policing. less aggressive policing means more crime and more deaths. on mother's day weekend in chicago, more than 50 people were shot between friday afternoon and early monday. during a 3\1/2\-hour period early saturday, one man was killed and 14 others wounded, as the chicago tribune said, ``the equivalent of someone being shot every 14 minutes.'' according to the tribune, police superintendent eddie johnson ``saved his harshest criticism for a criminal justice system that he said isn't putting away the city's most dangerous offenders for long enough periods. `until we have real truth in sentencing and hold these offenders accountable, this will be the unfortunate reality in the city of chicago.' '' according to an article in the washington post, april 2 of this year, ``violence is occurring at levels unseen for years [in chicago]. in the first quarter of 2016, 141 people were killed, up from 82 last year, according to police department data. the number of shootings surged to 677 from 359 a year earlier. the city is on track to have more than 500 killings this year, which would make this just the third year since 2004 that chicago topped that figure.'' some say we have too many people in prison. we have heard that. it is certainly our responsibility, in part, in congress, to set sentencing laws that are smart, that protect the public, don't put too many people in jail, and strike the right balance. in the early to mid-1980s, congress passed, in a bipartisan, overwhelming vote, mandatory minimum sentences and sentencing guidelines. they allowed dangerous people to be denied bail on appeal. they allowed people who made frivolous appeals--for the judge to assert that there was no substantial basis for the appeal and he could leave them in jail while they made their appeals because too many people were filing for appeals just to stay out of jail and committed crimes while they were out. all of these are great reforms. they are now under systemic attack. during that entire period of time, the crime rate in america went down. the murder rate in the late nineties was half what it was in 1980. how many good people are alive today because of this improvement in law enforcement? we ended the revolving door, where people were arrested, released, arrested. they came in another time and they are arrested and then they would get out and murder somebody. it was happening all the time. we didn't have the jail capacity to put the people in jail. we didn't have enough police to deal with the surging crime rate. when you have 20-, 30-, 40-percent increases in crime, you are talking about doubling the crime and murder rate in america in 2 or 3 years, after we spent 20 years bringing it down by half. we have to be sure that what we are doing, colleagues, is smart, and we are not signing death warrants for thousands of american innocent citizens. well, what is the prison situation today? is the population going up? according to the bureau of justice statistics, the rate of imprisonment in the united states is at its lowest in a decade. the federal prison population--195,914 as of may 12, 2016--is at its lowest level since 2006. since 2013, the federal prison population has decreased by over 20,000, and it is projected to continue downward. according to the federal bureau of prisons, the population is projected to drop another 10,000 this year, which will bring it to its lowest levels since 2005. the bureau of prisons, which houses prisoners, ``projects that the inmate population will continue to decline for the next couple of years, particularly as a result of retroactive changes to sentencing guidelines.'' indeed, the 46,276 federal drug trafficking inmates made eligible for early release comprise 25 percent of the current prison population. admissions to federal prisons have declined every year since 2011 and will likely decline further due to the obama administration's policy directing prosecutors not to charge certain criminal offenses. i don't think this congress has a duty to confirm everyone who is appointed by the president. we know the president has hostility toward prisons. he has directed his attorney general to reduce prison populations, and that is happening. he has directed the bureau of prisons to participate in this. he has directed the attorney general and the attorney general has agreed and issued policy that rejects attorney general thornburgh's policies when i was a u.s. attorney. basically, the thornburgh policy was, if a person used a gun during a crime, a bank robbery, or drug dealing, they were required, under the law, to get an additional 5 years' penalty in addition because the goal was to deter people from carrying guns during the criminal act, therefore, having fewer people killed in this country. it actually worked. in my opinion, it was part of the reason for the decline in the murder rate, clearly. you were required to charge them because the law said, if you carried a gun, you must get 5 years in addition to the other penalties. now the attorney general tells everybody: well, prosecutors, you don't have to charge that; in fact, we don't want you to charge too much on these kinds of cases. as a result, the prosecutions are down, drug prosecutions are down 21 percent, and sentencing is down too. when i asked the attorney general why the prosecutions of these cases are down so much, she said they are prosecuting bigger cases. i have to say that for the last 50 years, that is the excuse that prosecutors use for having a decline in statistics. they say: well, we are working bigger cases. but regardless if you are working bigger cases, why are the sentencing numbers down? presumably, she is saying: we are prosecuting more serious criminals, but the sentences are going down. we are seeing from the prosecutorial end a significant retrenchment or backing off of strong prosecution policy. a judge who gets a lifetime appointment and is no longer accountable to the american people--or anyone else, for that matter--is not entitled to confirmation if we have doubts about the ability over the years to treat police fairly and protect the public from serious criminals. certainly, it does not send a positive message to police and the community in baltimore, where she will hear cases if confirmed. last year was the deadliest year in baltimore's history--344 murders and countless crimes against persons and property. i believe ms. xinis's record demonstrates such a lack of understanding of the reality of law enforcement and the duty of our whole criminal justice system to protect the public as to disqualify her from the federal bench. [[page s2804]] that is why i will oppose the nomination. i do not believe she lacks the personal qualities or the integrity needed to be a judge or be a successful person throughout her life, whatever job she holds. she certainly has many admirers. i am not questioning that, but her record, as i have discussed, indicates an approach to law enforcement that does not justify the support of a lifetime appointment. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",42247
CREC-2016-05-16-pt1-PgS2804,CREC-2016-05-16,114,ZIKA VIRUS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2804-S2805] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ZIKA VIRUS Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the past few months the Zika virus has not only spread across the Caribbean and Latin America, but it has become a matter of grave concern in the United States. Although many of the symptoms are relatively minor, Zika has been found to cause severe birth defects in children if the virus is acquired by a woman of childbearing age who is, in fact, pregnant. In places where the virus has been especially active, experts have found alarming rates of infants born with something called microcephaly--in other words, basically a shrunken skull. Obviously, it is a profoundly damaging birth defect. This is due to the mother being infected by the virus while pregnant. As the weather continues to warm, Texans are rightly concerned about the continued spread of the virus in our State because it is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes. But it is not just any mosquito but those known to be present in places such as Texas, Florida, Louisiana, and some of the warmer areas. But we don't know if that will always be the case or whether they will expand their range or exactly how this could unroll. In fact, cases in 11 Texas counties have already been confirmed, including Austin, Houston, and Dallas. One important distinction in these cases is that they are tied to people traveling to Latin America, Puerto Rico, or Central America right now. In other words, there has been no confirmed case, I believe, by the Centers for Disease Control of anybody actually being bitten by a mosquito in the United States and having acquired the Zika virus. But that doesn't mean that it is not potentially dangerous, in fact, for the reasons I have mentioned, along with the fact that we now have at least a couple of cases of confirmed sexual transmission of the Zika virus. Fortunately, top research and medical facilities in Texas have been working on ways to prevent the spread of the Zika virus and to protect all Americans from its symptoms. A few months ago, I visited with some of those at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, where they told me about their work in Brazil studying this virus. As the world leader in mosquito-borne viruses, their research is continually groundbreaking. In fact, recently the Brazilian Ministry of Health announced a collaboration with researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston to help them develop a Zika virus vaccine. They have also had experience when it comes to tackling other large-scale viruses. Last year UTMB was named one of the first regional Ebola treatment centers in the country, and UTMB researchers went on to develop an effective, quick-acting Ebola vaccine. When they stressed the urgent need for the United States to approach this virus in a careful and deliberate manner, I listened to what they were telling me. I heard a similar message when I recently visited the Texas Medical Center in Houston. They, too, are medical pioneers and are working to create a rapid test for the virus and to strengthen mosquito control in potential hot spots. Interestingly, this is one of the most important components of dealing with the Zika virus; that is, mosquito control. Indeed, we will hear more about some of the EPA regulations that are currently in effect which discourage or inhibit the ability of local public health units in places such as Houston, Galveston, and elsewhere to actually control the mosquito population. We will talk more about that later. But like the researchers in Galveston, these folks at the Texas Medical Center urge congressional action so that our country can be better prepared to handle this potential health crisis, instead of having to react after the fact. When the cases of Ebola were confirmed in Dallas, I remember very clearly how people felt overwhelmed by the fast-developing situation on the ground, so much so that they really did not feel that they were totally prepared ahead of time to deal with it. We don't want to make that mistake twice when it comes to the Zika virus. Conversations I have had with these Texas institutions, as well as the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, the CDC, have underscored to me the need to act with urgency to avert what could become a major public health crisis in this country. Because States like mine boast a warmer climate and they are in closer proximity to where the mosquitoes that currently carry the Zika virus are located, we will likely serve on the frontline in dealing this summer with this response nationwide. Congress can't afford to sit back and do nothing. I don't hear anybody saying: Do nothing. I hear everybody saying we need to act clearly, with dispatch, and without unnecessary delay. But part of what we need to do is to make sure we have a plan in place and that we are executing a plan in a way that maximizes the effectiveness in combatting not only the mosquitoes that carry this virus but also the virus itself. We have to make sure our public health officials on the frontline of research and prevention have the resources they need to get the job done too. Fortunately, tomorrow, the Senate will vote on several pieces of legislation designed to provide additional Federal funding so public officials can handle this impending crisis head on. The first proposal is from the President of the United States. President Obama has made a spending request of nearly $2 billion that isn't paid for. It is emergency funding, meaning that the funding would be deficit-increasing and debt-increasing. Also, the President's proposal to spend $2 billion comes without very much in the way of a plan about how the administration would use the money. I guess they are asking us to trust them, but, frankly, I think we have a greater responsibility to make sure that the money will be put to good use and that we have appropriated an adequate amount of money--but not more money than is necessary--to deal with this potential crisis. The second piece of legislation we will vote on is a compromise package that was negotiated between the chairman and the ranking member of the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee in a bipartisan and commonsense way. I congratulate Senator Blunt and Senator Murray for working through this in an orderly sort of process, and I commend them on reaching an agreement. Their compromise bill is basically for $1.1 billion. In other words, it is not the $1.9 billion or $2 billion that the President requested. They thought the $1.1 billion was a more accurate and justifiable number. Unfortunately, the legislation that has been negotiated between the chairman and the ranking member of the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee is not paid for either. What this would essentially do is borrow from our children and grandchildren to meet the present exigencies of this crisis. The good news is we have a third option, which I want to talk about briefly. It is a third piece of legislation that I have introduced and which is nearly identical to the Blunt-Murray proposal, the Appropriations subcommittee proposal. It would also provide a compromise of $1.1 billion in Federal funding targeted toward health care professionals across the country. But my bill has a key distinction. It is fully paid for. You might ask: Where does that money come from? When the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare, as it has come to be [[Page S2805]] known--was passed, it included a provision for the Prevention and Public Health Fund. This, again, was part of the Affordable Care Act. The purpose that was stated in the legislation was ``to provide for expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs.'' In other words, it could have been tailor-made to deal with this potential Zika crisis. What I would propose is that we deal with the problem without delay. We appropriate the right amount of money, which both Democrats and Republicans--at least in the Appropriations Committee--have agreed is $1.1 billion, but that we take available funds and funds that will be available under the Prevention and Public Health Fund, and we pay for it. You wouldn't think that would be particularly revolutionary or novel around here, but unfortunately I think too often what we do is we act in an emergency or to avert an emergency and we don't follow through and do it in a fiscally responsible sort of way. The fact of the matter is we do need to address the Zika virus. There is no doubt about that. There is no difference among us in this Chamber or in Congress about the need to deal with that. As a matter of fact, the House of Representatives has proposed a version of their response today, I believe. But we need to do this responsibly. There is no reason why we have to put our country deeper in debt to protect ourselves against this virus. We don't have an endless supply of money. The Federal Treasury can't just keep printing money, and we can't just keep imposing on our children and grandchildren the responsibilities to pay the money back that we continue to borrow, particularly when we have a fund available to offset this expenditure. As the Presiding Officer well knows, our growing debt in and of itself is a threat to our country's future and our way of life. The Presiding Officer and I have listened to the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Perdue, talk about what impact our debt has on our ability not only to withstand another financial crisis, such as we had in 2008, but simply to fund such essential functions of the Federal Government like national defense. Particularly, as the interest rates are going up, more and more money is going to be paid to our bond holders, such as China and others, instead of paying for essential functions of the government, like national defense or safety net programs that we all agree are worthwhile. If we can deal with this potential crisis and do so in a fiscally responsible way without growing the debt, then we ought to be able to do that. This should be a no-brainer. We should take this opportunity tomorrow to give our public health officials and local officials back home the resources they need to protect our constituents--the American people--against the spread of the Zika virus, but we ought to do so without adding to our mounting debt. Fortunately, this legislation also includes a provision that would waive provisions of the Clean Water Act--I have referred to those a little earlier--and permit State and local officials to spray to protect against mosquitoes year around. Unfortunately, this particular legislation, the Clean Water Act, has provisions in it that essentially tie the hands of public health officials when it comes to mosquito eradication, which is one of the essential components of a strategy to defeat this potential crisis. We all agree that the Zika virus is a real threat with real public health consequences. It has already impacted a generation in Brazil and other Latin American countries. We are told it is apparently rampant in Puerto Rico and Haiti, and there is no question it is coming our way. With the summer months ahead of us, the potential for this virus to spread to the United States is a major concern that we ought to address with dispatch. We have to give those on the ground the tools and support they need to address this threat, but we have to do so in a responsible way. I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the legislation which funds the Zika prevention program at $1.1 billion but pays for it out of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, as apparently this fund was created to do--to ``provide for expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs.'' I urge my colleagues on both sides to support this legislation when we have a chance to vote tomorrow. The time to act is now. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2804-S2805] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ZIKA VIRUS Mr. CORNYN.

I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the legislation which funds the Zika prevention program at $1.1 billion but pays for it out of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, as apparently this fund was created to do--to ``provide for expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs.''

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, over the past few months the Zika virus has not only spread across the Caribbean and Latin America, but it has become a matter of grave concern in the United States. Although many of the symptoms are relatively minor, Zika has been found to cause severe birth defects in children if the virus is acquired by a woman of childbearing age who is, in fact, pregnant. In places where the virus has been especially active, experts have found alarming rates of infants born with something called microcephaly--in other words, basically a shrunken skull. Obviously, it is a profoundly damaging birth defect. This is due to the mother being infected by the virus while pregnant. As the weather continues to warm, Texans are rightly concerned about the continued spread of the virus in our State because it is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes. But it is not just any mosquito but those known to be present in places such as Texas, Florida, Louisiana, and some of the warmer areas. But we don't know if that will always be the case or whether they will expand their range or exactly how this could unroll. In fact, cases in 11 Texas counties have already been confirmed, including Austin, Houston, and Dallas. One important distinction in these cases is that they are tied to people traveling to Latin America, Puerto Rico, or Central America right now. In other words, there has been no confirmed case, I believe, by the Centers for Disease Control of anybody actually being bitten by a mosquito in the United States and having acquired the Zika virus. But that doesn't mean that it is not potentially dangerous, in fact, for the reasons I have mentioned, along with the fact that we now have at least a couple of cases of confirmed sexual transmission of the Zika virus. Fortunately, top research and medical facilities in Texas have been working on ways to prevent the spread of the Zika virus and to protect all Americans from its symptoms. A few months ago, I visited with some of those at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, where they told me about their work in Brazil studying this virus. As the world leader in mosquito-borne viruses, their research is continually groundbreaking. In fact, recently the Brazilian Ministry of Health announced a collaboration with researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston to help them develop a Zika virus vaccine. They have also had experience when it comes to tackling other large-scale viruses. Last year UTMB was named one of the first regional Ebola treatment centers in the country, and UTMB researchers went on to develop an effective, quick-acting Ebola vaccine. When they stressed the urgent need for the United States to approach this virus in a careful and deliberate manner, I listened to what they were telling me. I heard a similar message when I recently visited the Texas Medical Center in Houston. They, too, are medical pioneers and are working to create a rapid test for the virus and to strengthen mosquito control in potential hot spots. Interestingly, this is one of the most important components of dealing with the Zika virus; that is, mosquito control. Indeed, we will hear more about some of the EPA regulations that are currently in effect which discourage or inhibit the ability of local public health units in places such as Houston, Galveston, and elsewhere to actually control the mosquito population. We will talk more about that later. But like the researchers in Galveston, these folks at the Texas Medical Center urge congressional action so that our country can be better prepared to handle this potential health crisis, instead of having to react after the fact. When the cases of Ebola were confirmed in Dallas, I remember very clearly how people felt overwhelmed by the fast-developing situation on the ground, so much so that they really did not feel that they were totally prepared ahead of time to deal with it. We don't want to make that mistake twice when it comes to the Zika virus. Conversations I have had with these Texas institutions, as well as the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, the CDC, have underscored to me the need to act with urgency to avert what could become a major public health crisis in this country. Because States like mine boast a warmer climate and they are in closer proximity to where the mosquitoes that currently carry the Zika virus are located, we will likely serve on the frontline in dealing this summer with this response nationwide. Congress can't afford to sit back and do nothing. I don't hear anybody saying: Do nothing. I hear everybody saying we need to act clearly, with dispatch, and without unnecessary delay. But part of what we need to do is to make sure we have a plan in place and that we are executing a plan in a way that maximizes the effectiveness in combatting not only the mosquitoes that carry this virus but also the virus itself. We have to make sure our public health officials on the frontline of research and prevention have the resources they need to get the job done too. Fortunately, tomorrow, the Senate will vote on several pieces of legislation designed to provide additional Federal funding so public officials can handle this impending crisis head on. The first proposal is from the President of the United States. President Obama has made a spending request of nearly $2 billion that isn't paid for. It is emergency funding, meaning that the funding would be deficit-increasing and debt-increasing. Also, the President's proposal to spend $2 billion comes without very much in the way of a plan about how the administration would use the money. I guess they are asking us to trust them, but, frankly, I think we have a greater responsibility to make sure that the money will be put to good use and that we have appropriated an adequate amount of money--but not more money than is necessary--to deal with this potential crisis. The second piece of legislation we will vote on is a compromise package that was negotiated between the chairman and the ranking member of the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee in a bipartisan and commonsense way. I congratulate Senator Blunt and Senator Murray for working through this in an orderly sort of process, and I commend them on reaching an agreement. Their compromise bill is basically for $1.1 billion. In other words, it is not the $1.9 billion or $2 billion that the President requested. They thought the $1.1 billion was a more accurate and justifiable number. Unfortunately, the legislation that has been negotiated between the chairman and the ranking member of the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee is not paid for either. What this would essentially do is borrow from our children and grandchildren to meet the present exigencies of this crisis. The good news is we have a third option, which I want to talk about briefly. It is a third piece of legislation that I have introduced and which is nearly identical to the Blunt-Murray proposal, the Appropriations subcommittee proposal. It would also provide a compromise of $1.1 billion in Federal funding targeted toward health care professionals across the country. But my bill has a key distinction. It is fully paid for. You might ask: Where does that money come from? When the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare, as it has come to be [[Page S2805]] known--was passed, it included a provision for the Prevention and Public Health Fund. This, again, was part of the Affordable Care Act. The purpose that was stated in the legislation was ``to provide for expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs.'' In other words, it could have been tailor-made to deal with this potential Zika crisis. What I would propose is that we deal with the problem without delay. We appropriate the right amount of money, which both Democrats and Republicans--at least in the Appropriations Committee--have agreed is $1.1 billion, but that we take available funds and funds that will be available under the Prevention and Public Health Fund, and we pay for it. You wouldn't think that would be particularly revolutionary or novel around here, but unfortunately I think too often what we do is we act in an emergency or to avert an emergency and we don't follow through and do it in a fiscally responsible sort of way. The fact of the matter is we do need to address the Zika virus. There is no doubt about that. There is no difference among us in this Chamber or in Congress about the need to deal with that. As a matter of fact, the House of Representatives has proposed a version of their response today, I believe. But we need to do this responsibly. There is no reason why we have to put our country deeper in debt to protect ourselves against this virus. We don't have an endless supply of money. The Federal Treasury can't just keep printing money, and we can't just keep imposing on our children and grandchildren the responsibilities to pay the money back that we continue to borrow, particularly when we have a fund available to offset this expenditure. As the Presiding Officer well knows, our growing debt in and of itself is a threat to our country's future and our way of life. The Presiding Officer and I have listened to the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Perdue, talk about what impact our debt has on our ability not only to withstand another financial crisis, such as we had in 2008, but simply to fund such essential functions of the Federal Government like national defense. Particularly, as the interest rates are going up, more and more money is going to be paid to our bond holders, such as China and others, instead of paying for essential functions of the government, like national defense or safety net programs that we all agree are worthwhile. If we can deal with this potential crisis and do so in a fiscally responsible way without growing the debt, then we ought to be able to do that. This should be a no-brainer. We should take this opportunity tomorrow to give our public health officials and local officials back home the resources they need to protect our constituents--the American people--against the spread of the Zika virus, but we ought to do so without adding to our mounting debt. Fortunately, this legislation also includes a provision that would waive provisions of the Clean Water Act--I have referred to those a little earlier--and permit State and local officials to spray to protect against mosquitoes year around. Unfortunately, this particular legislation, the Clean Water Act, has provisions in it that essentially tie the hands of public health officials when it comes to mosquito eradication, which is one of the essential components of a strategy to defeat this potential crisis.

Madam President, I rise today to talk about the Zika virus. We will have a vote on this tomorrow. Tonight I wish to speak about the need for us to move forward with emergency funding with regard to this virus. We need to combat it. It is spreading. It poses a threat to the safety of women, children, and the elderly. It is particularly important that we keep it from spreading because there is no known Zika vaccine or treatment. A lot of my constituents have asked me about this back home. This is a virus that has spread from Africa, to Asia, to Latin America, and now it is coming into our own country. It is spreading so quickly because it is insidious. It is difficult to test for it because it is usually confused with other viruses, like dengue. It can only be detected in a few days after you get it in the blood. Many of its symptoms in older adults are similar to other viruses, such as influenza, so it is tough to know whether you have it. It is typically contracted simply by being bitten by a mosquito, and two kinds of mosquitoes--both of which are in the United States--are the problem. We now know that it can also be transmitted by sexual activity. We are told that men may be able to sexually transmit the virus for months after the initial infection based on some experiences. So, again, this is a difficult issue. Some people may not even know they have it; yet they might be spreading it. The spread of the virus is accelerating. It took 60 years for Zika to make it out of Africa to the Pacific. Just 8 years after that, it reached the Western Hemisphere in Latin America. Today it has infected people in 62 countries, including the United States and 34 other countries in the Americas, so pretty much every country in the Americas is now infected with it. Hundreds of Americans have been infected. We know of nearly 500, including 48 pregnant women and 12 people in my home State of Ohio, in fact. Thus far, it looks as though all of the Americans who have become infected did so by traveling overseas, being infected by the mosquito or by sexual contact with someone who had Zika. The World Health Organization calls it ``a threat of alarming proportions'' because it is spreading so quickly and because it has serious consequences for the most vulnerable in our society, particularly the elderly--an older gentleman in Puerto Rico recently died of Zika--children, babies in the womb, which we will talk about in a second, and pregnant women. As Zika has spread, health officials have reported an increased incidence of babies born with a horrible birth defect [[Page S2806]] where a baby's head and brain are abnormally small. The consequences of this birth defect are absolutely tragic. These kids have seizures, slow development, intellectual disabilities, and often loss of hearing and vision. The consequences last a lifetime. There is no known cure for this disease. We don't want any child to have to suffer through that. It is in all of our interests to protect more babies from this syndrome. In Brazil, there have been more than 900 confirmed cases since Zika arrived, with another 4,000 suspected cases. These are conservative estimates, and they are rising. That is up from around an average of 150 each year--a 600-percent increase from year to year. Officials also tell us that Zika can cause what is called Guillain- Barre syndrome, which causes the body's immune system to attack its own nerves. It is a cruel syndrome, and in bad cases it can cause total paralysis and loss of sensation. This can happen to anyone, not just newborns but adults as well. These are just two of the neurological side effects that can result, and, like Zika, they are thought to be incurable. For most adults, Zika is not fatal, but to the most vulnerable, like the elderly and the unborn, it could be a lifetime of suffering, disability, or even death. I mentioned the man in Puerto Rico who died last week after being infected by Zika, a fellow American. His immune system began to attack the platelets in his blood, so they couldn't clot, and that was the effect for him. As Zika spreads, it becomes clearer than ever that our response has to be very aggressive, both domestically and internationally. It has to be aggressive, and therefore it has to be funded. That is why I think it is important that we deal with emergency funding before it is truly an emergency. I thank my colleagues for the steps they have already taken to improve our response. In March, this body passed and President Obama signed into law bipartisan legislation which I cosponsored with my friend Senator Franken that will give accelerated priority review at the Food and Drug Administration for new drugs and vaccines to treat Zika. This is very important, and I applaud the Senate for moving quickly and the administration for moving on that. It is a critical step. Right now, there is no cure and no treatment. President Obama has signed it into law. I am also grateful to the administration for redirecting more than $500 million of residual Ebola funds that were originally appropriated by Congress to deal with Ebola and were not necessary. They stopped using those funds for Ebola and shipped those funds over to Zika to stop it from spreading. I applaud them for that as well. Again, we have more work to do, and it is my view that we ought to move forward with emergency funding. There was a proposal--I believe it was finalized just last week, Thursday or Friday--from Senator Blunt and Senator Murray that goes a long way toward dealing with this issue. The majority of the funding is right here in the United States, while the rest will go to international immigration purposes so we can keep Zika from crossing our borders again. A lot of this funding goes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--the majority of it--to enhance mosquito control programs, improve infrastructure for testing for Zika, and expand the pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system, all of which are important. This is emergency funding, and I think it is necessary. Some funding also helps provide health services for pregnant women in Puerto Rico and invests in scientific research for a treatment or a vaccine. This is perhaps the most important thing we can do. These are critical priorities. I would also note that I am pleased that we have maintained the Hyde protections in this proposal, and I believe this is consistent with the goal of protecting innocent life, protecting these innocent babies from birth defects. We want this funding to be used to help preserve life and to help the vulnerable. We need to ensure adequate funding. We have to recognize the tools already at our disposal and use them. I have remained in contact with the Secretary of the Air Force as this virus has spread to make clear that in Ohio we have reservists at Youngstown Air Reserve Station who are ready to help. This Air Reserve Station in Youngstown, OH, is the home of the 910th Airlift Wing, which is the only fixed-wing aerial spray unit in the United States. It has been used by the military all over the United States. They have played key roles in other public health emergencies, including spraying millions of acres in Louisiana and Texas for mosquito abatement after Hurricane Katrina. I believe they could play that same role now. They are ready to do it, but frankly they need an upgrade in their equipment to be able to do it. As RADM Stephen Redd of the CDC told me in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, ``there could be a role for that airwing in locations that do not have [finely honed mosquito control enterprises].'' He said that a lot of counties in this country do not have that. He said: ``One of the things that we think is really important that the Zika virus outbreak is pointing out is the need to really revitalize those mosquito control efforts.'' I couldn't agree with him more. We need to revitalize these efforts to be sure we have them and use the tools that are at our disposal right now. If Zika were to spread around the country, it is incredibly important that we have this control effort. I hope we move forward on this in the next couple of days, send this legislation to the President for his signature, and get moving on dealing with the Zika emergency we have before us. People all over Ohio ask me about it because they are worried. We need to keep our constituents safe, and we need to give them peace of mind. Adopting the amendment I think we are going to have before us in the next couple of days is the best action we can take right now to achieve these goals, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to strongly support emergency funding for this purpose. Thank you. I yield back my time. THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been 5 weeks since the Senate last confirmed a judicial nominee. In that time, judicial vacancies have continued to increase. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership has repeatedly objected to unanimous consent motions made to overcome the obstruction of 20 judicial nominees. These are nominees who were voted out unanimously by committee and are awaiting a confirmation vote. The majority leader claims that President Obama's nominees have been treated fairly, but anyone paying attention to the Senate over the past 7 years knows that is not the case. It has been almost 2 months since Chief Judge Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Chief Judge Garland is widely respected, and prior to his nomination, he had repeatedly received praise from the very Republicans who now refuse to allow him to appear for a confirmation hearing. These same Republicans refuse to do their jobs as Senators while outside groups pour millions of dollars into television ads that seek to discredit Chief Judge Garland's record. Before there was even a Supreme Court nominee, one Republican aide promised conservatives were ``going to light this person up.'' Sadly, it appears they are making good on their threat while simultaneously refusing to allow him a public hearing where he could respond. Meanwhile, lower court nominees have stalled. Paula Xinis, whom we will vote on today, was nominated more than a year ago to fill an emergency vacancy--not just a regular vacancy but an emergency vacancy in Maryland. Since 2011, she has practiced as a criminal defense attorney at a law firm. Prior to that, she served in the Federal Public Defender's Office for the District of Maryland for 13 years, from 1998 to 2011. Ms. Xinis has extensive trial experience, representing hundreds of clients as a public defender and trying 16 cases to completion over the course of her career. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Ms. Xinis ``well qualified'' to serve in the district court. They gave Paula Xinis their highest rating. She is strongly supported by both Senators from Maryland, and her nomination was unanimously approved by the Judiciary [[Page S2807]] Committee by voice vote 8 months ago. All the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee approved her nomination from the Committee by unanimous voice vote. Senator Sessions came to the floor today to oppose Ms. Xinis's nomination based on her experience as an examiner of complaints against police officers in the District of Columbia. From 1995 to 2011, Ms. Xinis served as a complaint examiner in six cases where she made determinations on complaints brought against Metropolitan Police Department officers. At her Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator Sessions questioned Ms. Xinis about her experience and expressed concern that, in the six cases Ms. Xinis served as a complaint examiner, she sustained rulings against police officers in all of them. Senator Sessions questions Ms. Xinis's fairness to police officers based on her determinations in these six cases. However, as Senator Sessions said on the floor today, he does not question her personal qualifications or her integrity to be a Federal judge. And he also did not question her testimony before the Judiciary Committee in which she committed to being a fair and impartial judge, should she be confirmed. Furthermore, Ms. Xinis's record as a complaint examiner shows that each one of her six determinations was sustained by the chief of police; none of them was overturned. Her decisions could have been appealed and overturned if they were incorrect, but they were not. Paula Xinis has earned the express support of law enforcement and has defended police officers as an attorney on a number of occasions. For instance, in one case, she provided legal counsel to a Baltimore police officer unfairly accused of criminal wrongdoing. That officer wrote a letter of support for Ms. Xinis, where he said: ``Throughout the entire ordeal, I spent countless hours with Paula and her team. They worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she `had my back' and that she was dedicated to seeing that I was vindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all of the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year.'' This does not sound like a person who holds any biases against law enforcement. In addition to this officer, several other members of the law enforcement community have written in support of Ms. Xinis's nomination. After we actually vote on Paula Xinis's nomination today, there will still be 19 judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar waiting for a confirmation vote. Every single one of these nominees was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. Instead of allowing a vote on these nominees on a regular basis, the Republican leadership objects to the Senate being able to do our jobs. After today's vote, the next in line for consideration is a district court nominee from New Jersey and then a district court nominee from Nebraska. I know the Senators from New Jersey are pushing for a vote on the nominee to serve in their State. I hope the Republican Senators from Nebraska are urging their leadership to schedule the confirmation of Robert Rossiter, who was approved by unanimous voice vote in committee. That vacancy has been pending for over a year and a half. There is no good reason for votes on these nominees to be further delayed. Senator Grassley has indicated that Republicans will shut down the judicial nominations process in July, even though vacancies have risen from 43 to 81 since Republicans took over the majority. They have allowed vacancies to rise dramatically and now want to shut it down even though the judicial nominees pending are not controversial and we have numerous vacancies that need to be filled. This is wrong. Contrast this to the last 2 years of George W. Bush's administration, when Democrats were in control. At this same point in the Bush Presidency, Democrats had reduced vacancies to just 46. Because of Republican obstruction, our independent judiciary is struggling to perform its role under the Constitution. The Marshall Project recently interviewed several sitting judges to examine the impact judicial vacancies are having on our courts. Chief Judge Ron Clark of the Eastern District of Texas, which currently has three judicial emergency vacancies, said: ``We're managing the best we can-- but if they don't get us another judge soon, you could start to see some more draconian kinds of delays.'' There is a nominee to this court pending in the Judiciary Committee, but the Texas Senators, who both are members of the committee, have not returned their blue slips to allow that nominee to even receive a hearing. I hope the Texas Senators heed the call of Chief Judge Clark and get moving on their nominee. And I hope the Senate majority allows this body to return to regular order when it comes to processing judicial nominees. We have a constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on the President's nominees. The Constitution has not changed, but once President Obama took office, this body's normal practice for treating nominees turned for the worse. Deference to home State Senators was no longer the norm, and procedural delay after procedural delay quickly became the standard practice of the Republican caucus, whether they were in the minority or now in the majority. In a New York Times op-ed a week ago, former Judge Shira Sheindlin of the Southern District of New York warned that the Republicans' obstruction to district court nominees ``undermines public trust in the impartiality and legitimacy of the judiciary.'' I was heartened to hear the majority leader last week make the point that an election year is ``not an excuse not to do our work.'' I could not agree more. That is why in the last 2 years of the George W. Bush administration, when I served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we confirmed 68 of President Bush's judicial nominees. That is compared to a handful of President Obama's nominees that the Republicans have allowed. We confirmed 68 of President Bush's judicial nominees, and we confirmed right up to the time we went out for the elections in September, not in June or July or May. We have also confirmed more than a dozen Supreme Court Justices in Presidential election years, and many in this Senate served at the time. The last one we had, of course, was during President Reagan's final year in office. We did so because we knew the Supreme Court should not be held hostage to election-year politics; yet we are being held hostage to election-year politics because we are not doing our jobs. And the Supreme Court issued a couple more 4-to-4 opinions today. I urge the majority leader to heed his own advice and to schedule a confirmation vote for the pending lower court nominees, and I urge the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to follow suit by scheduling confirmation hearings for Chief Judge Garland so that we can do our jobs. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Judge Sheindlin's op-ed and the Marshall Project review be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Marshall Project, April 26, 2016] What Happens When There Aren't Enough Judges to Go Around? (By Eli Hager) The ninth seat on the Supreme Court has been vacant for two months. But Antonin Scalia's chair is not the only empty one in the vast federal judiciary, where several judgeships have remained unfilled for 30 months or more. Around the country, there are 84 of these vacancies, largely as a result of the Senate's historically low rate of confirming President Barack Obama's nominees. And since the beginning of last year, the number of unfilled seats and pending nominations have been steadily rising. Down in the gears of the justice system, all those absent judges have taken a toll. Because courts are obligated to find ways to meet speedy- trial rules, at least in criminal cases, the vacancies have not caused across-the-board delays. But by all accounts, the unconfirmed nominees--combined with what advocates say is an insufficient number of judgeships overall--have forced the system to find sometimes extraordinary ways to make do with the few judges available. Some judges, for example, are having to drive hundreds of miles to cover the empty seats. Less-qualified magistrate judges, senior judges who are supposed to be entering retirement, and visiting judges who fly in from other states, have all had to pitch in. And many of the remaining judges say that it's hard, with such a lack of personnel, to give every case the attention it deserves. In the worst-hit districts, including all four districts of Texas, some areas of Florida [[Page S2808]] and California, Middle Alabama, and elsewhere, the situation is now considered an ``emergency.'' Ron Clark, chief judge of the Eastern District of Texas, which has three judicial emergencies out of only eight total judgeships, says that ``we're managing the best we can--but if they don't get us another judge soon, you could start to see some more draconian kinds of delays.'' Judicial Vacancies in the Federal Courts In the past year, unfilled federal judgeships have been rising dramatically. Similarly, the number of seats on the bench considered ``emergencies''--vacant for many months with a large caseload per judge--and the number of White House nominations awaiting Senate confirmation have climbed. A 2014 study by the Brennan Center for Justice found that the vacancies led to a host of negative consequences. Among them were unresolved motions, habeas corpuspetitions waiting years to be heard (or being handled by law clerks instead of judges), judges spending less time on each case, and defendants pleading guilty because they believed a trial would not get the timely attention it deserved. And in civil proceedings, where the Speedy Trial Act does not apply, longer wait times for trial are becoming more common. Morrison C. England Jr., chief judge of the Eastern District of California, says that ``cases that aren't the priority are going to get pushed back for years, literally.'' In Middle Alabama, Ricky Martin, a pastor, had been allowing registered sex-offenders to stay in mobile homes surrounding his church--until the state legislature made it illegal for him to do so. Martin filed suit in August of 2014, and the local D.A. responded with a ``motion to dismiss'' a few months later. But a judge didn't get around to weighing in--in Martin's favor--until this April, and the case may not actually be resolved for two more years or longer. The process would have taken only three to four months if there were more judges available, says Randall Marshall, legal director of the ACLU of Alabama. But sometimes, the effect is the opposite: the proceedings get rushed. Brian McGiverin, a civil-rights lawyer in Austin, Texas, says that because there are so few judges, the remaining ones are all overbooked. As a result, they often ``give you a cramped amount of time for trial, regardless of how many witnesses you'd like to call.'' McGiverin recently assisted in the case of a woman named Abieyuwa Ikhinmwin, who claimed that she was racially profiled, handled with excessive force, and wrongfully arrested by police in San Antonio. He says the court tried to ``fast-track'' her lawsuit, threatening to dismiss it within 21 days unless she paid a fee and submitted additional information--which would not have happened when there were enough judges. Clark, chief judge in the nearby Eastern District of Texas, says that ``with so few of us, it's definitely harder to have the flexibility that a defense lawyer might want us to. So the answer sometimes has to be, `No, sorry, we can't offer that time in court.' '' Meanwhile, the consequences of too few judges are worsened in the most geographically expansive districts. ``When there's a missing judge in a state like ours,'' Clark says, ``it's not like we can walk down the hall and take care of a trial for him--the trip from Beaumont to Plano is five and a half hours, and that's if the traffic is good.'' He and the other judges in his district waste about two days a week on the road. ``We're one traffic accident away from the wheels falling off,'' he says. As an additional stop-gap measure, the worst-hit districts are relying on pinch hitters. In Middle Alabama, less-experienced magistrate judges (who are appointed directly by the district judges, rather than nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate) have for several years been doing work once reserved for the district judges, from taking guilty pleas to overseeing evidentiary hearings. The district is also getting last- minute help from visiting judges, who have traveled from Iowa and Florida to pitch in. ``When there are judges who come in from elsewhere,'' says Christine Freeman, executive director of the federal defender's office in Montgomery, Ala., ``they are strangers to us, to the prosecutor, to court officials, to the probation officers, to every single person involved in a case.'' ``That makes it very hard to predict outcomes for your client,'' Freeman adds. But the lack of judges has perhaps fallen hardest on senior judges, who, because they are typically over 70 or 80 years old, usually take on 50 percent or less of a full caseload. Instead, in Middle Alabama and elsewhere, their caseloads have been 150 or even 200 percent of normal. ``I'm 73, and I'd like to be able to say, `Look, I'm done, I want to spend more time with my family,' '' says Michael Schneider, one of the senior judges in Eastern Texas. ``I'm encouraged that the president has nominated someone, but I can't actually cut back until a nominee is approved.'' ``I'm going to be at this for awhile,'' Schneider adds. ``It's frustrating.'' England, the chief judge in Eastern California, says that senior judges are the only reason why vacancies haven't become more of a crisis. ``We are living and dying with our senior judges,'' England says. ``They're taking on cases they shouldn't have to, but that's what's saving us.'' Of course, federal courts being overburdened is the symptom of more than simply a lack of nominations and confirmations. Since 1990, Congress has not passed major legislation creating new judgeships, even as the war on drugs, and now the surge in prosecution of undocumented immigrants, have jammed up the system with exponentially more cases. As a result, by 2013, there was a 39 percent uptick in the number of overall filings, while only 4 percent more judges were added to handle all that extra work. Throw in the higher-than-normal number of vacancies, and it's a recipe for an overburdened judiciary. After a three- year wait, for instance, the Eastern District of California finally got a vacancy filled last October. But Chief Judge England says the crushing burden of too few judges hasn't lessened. ``One way or the other, Congress would need to give this district more judges,'' he says. ``We need help--we have too many trials. I'm booked for 2016 and 2017 already.'' ____ [From the New York Times, May 6, 2016] America's Trial Court Judges: Our Front Line for Justice (By Shira A. Scheindlin) The outcry over the Senate's failure to hold hearings on Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court is fully justified. But that isn't the only judiciary scandal on Capitol Hill. Even as the spotlight shines on the high court, the Senate has refused to confirm dozens of uncontroversial nominees to fill vacancies in the federal trial courts. Such obstructionism has become an everyday occurrence. Just last week, Senate Republicans refused to vote on 11 federal district court nominees whom the Judiciary Committee had already approved--even those who were supported by Republicans in their home states. During President George W. Bush's last two years in office, the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed about 57 district court judges. Since Republicans took power in 2014, the Senate has confirmed only 15 of President Obama's trial court nominees. This is an even bigger problem than Judge Garland's stalled nomination. Trial court judges do the bulk of the work in the federal court system: Last year nearly 375,000 new cases were filed, while the Supreme Court justices issued just under 75 opinions. And because most trial court decisions are never appealed, they become the final word in significant disputes that affect millions of Americans. I know this firsthand. I served as a trial judge for over 21 years, and stepped down from the bench last week. As I walked out of a federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan on one of my last days, an African-American United States marshal asked me if he could have a word. He explained that he had grown up in New York City's public housing, and thanked me for my 2013 decision in the ``stop and frisk'' case. (I ruled that the New York Police Department's practice in which police officers stopped hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers without reasonable suspicion, a vast majority of whom were innocent African- Americans and Latinos, was unconstitutional.) ``You just can't know what a difference this has made to so many people in my community,'' he said. ``You can't even imagine.'' But I think I can. At the policy's peak in 2011, officers stopped nearly 700,000 people. That number dropped to about 23,000 last year, and the policy change was not accompanied by a rise in serious crime, despite dire predictions to the contrary. As a result of my rulings and community outcry, the Police Department agreed to reforms, which include better record keeping, the use of police body cameras and the abandonment of racial profiling. Other examples abound. In 1974, Judge Jack Weinstein of the Eastern District of New York found the de facto segregation in a Coney Island public school to be unconstitutional, a ruling affirmed on appeal. The school was ultimately integrated under his supervision, and without the ``white flight'' that politicians had feared would result. And in one of the highest-profile civil rights cases ever in a trial court, Leonard about a decade later that both the housing and schools in Yonkers were intentionally segregated, and ordered construction of integrated housing in the city. An appeals court upheld this ruling, which, despite years of public protest, immensely improved the living conditions for thousands of Yonkers residents. The influence of district judges has likewise had an effect on national security. In the mid-2000s, Judge Alvin Hellerstein, also from the Southern District of New York, ordered the government to disclose photographs under the Freedom of Information Act that depict the abuse of Abu Ghraib detainees, which was affirmed by the appellate court. Judge Hellerstein also effectively forced the government to turn over the Department of Justice's infamous ``torture memos,'' which incited a national conversation about whether torture is ever appropriate. Not every decision by district court judges benefits the public: Last week Judge Thomas Schroeder of North Carolina's Middle District upheld myriad legislative changes to the state's voting rules that will result in reduced voting opportunities for minorities, unless reversed. [[Page S2809]] Whether Judge Garland should be confirmed or not, there can be no denying that Supreme Court nominations are inherently political. So it's no surprise that they are drawn out for ideological or partisan reasons. But district court nominations are different. Ideology is not the issue: Experience and competence are the only criteria. And yet the Senate majority's policy of delaying qualified district-court nominations on purely political grounds undermines public trust in the impartiality and legitimacy of the judiciary. This is especially worrisome because the public's understanding of how justice is administered is most likely based on its access to and experience with lower court proceedings. Presidential debates have focused on the Islamic State, trade pacts and immigration policy; meanwhile, the next president will most likely appoint 130 trial judges over the next four years. The public needs to know what's at stake. Trial judges must spot the issues, decide the outcomes and fashion the remedies in all kinds of disputes. I cannot force this Congress to do its job. But I urge voters not to forget the White House's power to appoint all judges when they choose the next president. Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I rise this evening in support of the nomination of Paula Xinis to serve on the District Court of Maryland. I know Senator Cardin will be coming to the floor shortly to also comment on Ms. Xinis's nomination. Senator Cardin and I recommended Ms. Xinis to President Obama with the utmost confidence in her abilities, talent, and competence for the job. She is a brilliant litigator and a dedicated public servant. The Judiciary Committee agreed with us, because they also voted her out of the committee unanimously. I thank Senator McConnell, the majority leader, for scheduling this vote; Senator Grassley for moving this nomination; and I also thank my very good and dear friend Senator Leahy, the vice chairman of the committee, who has been a strong advocate not only for this nomination but for moving all nominations forward, as voted out by the committee in a prompt way. As I talk about Ms. Xinis, I want the Presiding Officer to know that I have recommended several judicial nominees for district and appellate courts, and I take my advise and consent responsibility very seriously. When I recommend to the President a position on the district court, I have four criteria: absolute integrity, judicial competence and temperament, a commitment to core constitutional principles, and a history of civic engagement in Maryland. Ms. Xinis exceeds these expectations over and beyond. She has dedicated her career to the rule of law, achieving equal justice under the law and also being an advocate for the underdog. She is truly an outstanding nominee with a long history of public service--14 years as a Federal public defender, handling everything from the most simple misdemeanors to very complex white-collar crimes. She has also taken on extra duties, training staff and being an attorney supervisor of research and writing, proving time and time again how committed and dedicated she is. She worked as a clerk for the distinguished and esteemed Judge Diana Gribbon Motz, a well-respected judge on the Fourth Circuit. She also has been a member of the private sector as a senior trial partner in a private law firm in Baltimore, taking on complex civil litigation and protecting those who have been harmed by lead paint or carbon monoxide poisoning. Judge Motz, in recommending Ms. Xinis to me, said she is so intelligent and generous in terms of working very hard, in terms of knowing the law and practicing the law, but she also commented on her work ethic, praising her skill in the courtroom and her service to the community. She has mentored children, provided legal advice to at-need communities in Baltimore, and served on numerous bar associations. She has deep appreciation for the law and everything that it means. I do believe she will be an outstanding judge. There have been criticisms raised of Ms. Xinis, and the criticisms have centered around her support within the law enforcement community. Flashing yellow lights were raised by one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, asking whether she had an impartial attitude toward police officers. I have four letters here from retired police officers in Baltimore City all attesting to that. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: City of Charlottesville, Police Department, Charlottesville, VA, August 30, 2015. Re Letter in Support of Paula Xinis, for the position of United States District Judge for the District of Maryland. Hon. Charles Grassley, Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Honorable Senators Grassley and Leahy: My name is Timothy Longo and I currently serve as the Chief of Police in the City of Charlottesville, Virginia. I am a career law enforcement officer having previously served as a Colonel with the Baltimore City Police Department, retiring in March of 2000. In addition, to my professional training and experience, I am proud to have received my law degree from the University of Baltimore and was admitted to the Maryland Bar in December of 1993. For the past 25 years, I have had the honor of instructing thousands of law enforcement officers and administrators on matters of policy, law, and generally accepted policing practices. In addition to my sworn duties and responsibilities, I have served on many occasions as a police practices expert assisting both plaintiff and defense counsel in civil rights claims resulting from the actions of law enforcement officers, and the policies and practices related to those actions. It is in this capacity that I have come to know and respect Paula Xinis. I have come to learn that the Senate Judiciary Committee is presently considering Paula's candidacy and I respectfully write in support of her appointment. Paula and I met several years ago when I was asked to assist her in the evaluation of a civil rights claim that she had filed on behalf of a client related to the actions of a municipal law enforcement officer and the agency and municipality that employed that officer. The claim arose out of a use of force incident which resulted in serious and permanent injury. I firmly believe that cases such as this requires not only a thorough understanding of Section 1983 litigation and that of municipal liability, but an equally thorough understanding of police training, policy, and practice. For more than a year, I worked closely with Paula as she sought to better understand how a police officer is trained, the policies, principles, and practices that guide their work, as well as the manner in which police departments investigate incidents that result in force. What I discovered from the onset, and frankly what continued to impress me as I worked with Paula on this important matter, is the thoughtful and objective manner in which she approached both the facts and the theory of her client's case. Although the complaint she had advanced on behalf of her client depicted a series of facts that one may find was clearly contrary to generally accepted policing practices on the face of her client's complaint, she consistently endeavored to examine that complaint and the facts in the support of it through the lenses of a career law enforcement officer who had not only worked the streets of a large metropolitan city, instructed thousands in policing, but also served as a policy maker as to the training of police officers and practices that guide that work. She and I spoke countless times, and at great length, about not only that particular case but the way that police officers go about their work and the decisions that they make quickly and oftentimes without much deliberation. Paula was amazingly careful to reserve her own judgment and opinion as to the appropriateness of the officer's conduct and that of the agency's policy maker and listened carefully to my assessment of her claim and my opinion as to its propriety in light of my specialized training and experience. America's law enforcement officers are facing incredibly difficult challenges as we closely evaluate the manner in which we go about our work, carefully consider re-shaping and reforming our practices, and endeavor to strengthen the necessary relationships we have with those whom we serve. Undoubtedly, law enforcement officers, policy makers, and municipalities will more frequently find themselves being scrutinized by our trial and appellate courts, and ultimately the court of public opinion. The nature of our work and recent police-citizen interactions that have ended tragically makes this reality most certain. Thus, it has never been more critical to connect the right people to this important work; not just on the front line but throughout the criminal justice continuum. It is with a tremendous amount of pride and the utmost confidence that I respectfully ask the Senate of the United States to confirm the appointment of Paula Xinis to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. I have absolutely no doubt that Paula will bring the competence and objectivity that is necessary to discharge the [[Page S2810]] duties of such an important position. She has my confidence, respect, and unfettered support. If I can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to call upon me. Meanwhile, I thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration.

I have held several positions of authority include: Field Training Officer, Officer in Charge, Sergeant and Sergeant in Charge. I have been assigned to follow district units: Patrol, Flex Units, Drug Unit, and Firearm Instructor. I'm currently assigned to the departments, Special Operation Section. I have held tactical positions as both an officer and sergeant within the elite Emergency Service Unit. My current assignment is supervising sergeant of the K-9 unit. I am also a passed board member of Maryland's largest FOP with over 5000 active and retired members. As a member of FOP Lodge #3, I have held numerous positions within our lodge to include. Grievance Rep, Grievance Chairman, P.A.C funds Chairman, Legal Advisory Board, Contract Team Chairman, and was elected to the position of Vice President for our Lodge. It is my understanding that the Senate Judiciary Committee will be considering Ms. Paula Xinis for United States District Judge. I would proudly recommend Ms Xinis to the position of U.S District Judge for Maryland. Ms Xinis is a person of honor, integrity, fairness and would be outstanding in that position. In closing as a 20 year member of the law enforcement community, I know first hand the need to have judges that are well balanced, fair and great listeners. It is equally important that our judges take the rule of law and always apply it equally, with understanding and compassion in there decision. That is why I proudly recommend Ms. Paula Xinis to the position of U.S. District Judge. Respectfully, Sgt. Brian Atwood. ____ Abingdon, MD, August 31, 2015. Re Letter in Support of Judicial Nomination of Paula Xinis for the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Hon. Charles Grassley, Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Senators Grassley and Leahy: Please accept this letter as support for the nomination of Paula Xinis as a United States District Judge for the District of Maryland. I was employed as a Police Officer with the Baltimore Police Department from 1987 until the time of my retirement in September 2014. While assigned to the Patrol Division, I handled calls for service related to violations of Maryland's handgun and narcotics laws. I also actively participated in shooting investigations. I also spent thirteen years assigned to the Tactical Unit/Quick Response Team. During my tenure with the Tactical Unit, one of the Unit's primary focus was serving high risk warrants for the Homicide and Robbery Units. When we weren't training, serving warrants and/or responding to barricade/hostage situations, we were utilized as suppression unit for illegal handguns and narcotics violations. For five straight years, my partner and I maintained the highest number of gun seizures/arrests and the largest narcotics cases within the Baltimore City Police Tactical Section. We received numerous commendations for our handgun arrests. Throughout the course of my career, I was called upon to testify in both the District and Circuit Courts in Baltimore City and County, as well as the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in Baltimore. Unfortunately, my successful career in law enforcement was derailed in 2014 when I encountered difficulties in connection with a call for service. I was improperly and unfairly accuse of wrongdoing which led to criminal charges. This was a new experience for me as I had never even been disciplined during my career. I felt vulnerable and betrayed. It was clear to me and my wife that we needed legal representation that would aggressively fight to vindicate me. My wife, whose practice is primarily the defense of civil cases, had been involved in a case in Baltimore City where Ms. Xinis represented the plaintiffs several years prior. During the course of that case, she would often remark that Ms. Xinis was a worthy advocate, yet fair and open-minded. Because of her experience with Ms. Xinis, my wife contacted her on a weekend to seek legal counsel and advice. From that point forward, Ms. Xinis made herself available to us, even if it was to simply reassure us that we were in good hands. Throughout the entire ordeal, I spent countless hours with Paula and her team. They worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she ``had my back'' and that she was dedicated to seeing that I was vindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all of the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year. I can personally attest to Ms. Xinis' legal acumen and her commitment to seeking justice, regardless of who the defendant may be. I observed her demonstrate the ability to forcefully argue her position to the court while being respectful to the court and other counsel. She can be a fierce advocate while maintaining a reassuring demeanor. My exposure to the judicial process throughout the course of my law enforcement career and as an officer who was wrongfully accused, has provided me with insight as to what is required to be an effective, fair and open-minded jurist. I can state without a doubt that Ms. Xinis possesses all of the necessary traits to be an asset to the federal bench in Maryland. The Committee could not find a more qualified candidate to fill the vacancy in Maryland. Sincerely, Thomas J. Schmidt, Sr. ____ September 1, 2015. Re Support of Paula Xinis, for United States District Judge for the District of Maryland. Dear Senator Patrick Leahy (Ranking Member) United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary: My name is Gregory Eads, Jr. I am a retired Baltimore City Police Officer. I served 22 years on the Baltimore City Police Department and retired in November 2014. I was currently assigned to the Bomb Squad and Emergency Services Unit where primarily I responded to suspicious package calls, bomb sweeps for visiting V.I.P's and stadium events. In my tenure as a police officer with the department I've acquired several skills and with worked in numerous specialized units. I have worked in Patrol, Bike(flex) squad, Drug enforcement unit, SWAT, Organized Crime Unit, Firearms Apprehension Strike Team. I am highly decorated officer that was awarded several unit citations, accommodations, and bronze star for valor. I've come to learn the senate Judiciary Committee is considering Paula for a United States District Judge. I want to extend my support for Paula as a candidate. Paula and I met at her law firm as she was preparing to defend a co- worker in criminal case. She was interviewing me as a character witness. During this exchange we discussed my family, experiences and my background being a second generation Police Officer in Baltimore City. We share some similarities on life and making a difference in the world. Paula has a young child, demanding career and is very well known among her peers. I was most impressed with her attention to detail, due diligence and preparation of the case. She is hardworking, open minded, and fair. I believe she would be an asset as she exemplifies the firm qualities that a United States District Court Judge possesses. As a police officer we need Judges that are fair, impartial and firm on the bench. With Paula being confirmed by the Senate Committee you will have that Judge I am referring to. I am grateful that I had the pleasure of meeting and working with Paula. Sincerely, Gregory Eads Jr., (Retired) BPD. Ms. MIKULSKI. One letter is from someone who is a 20-year veteran, working in the Western District. The Western District is where they filmed ``The Wire.'' It is rough, tough, and hardscrabble. This former police sergeant said: In closing, as a 20-year member of the law enforcement community, I know firsthand the need to have judges that are well balanced, fair and great listeners. . . . That is why I proudly recommend Ms. Paula Xinis to the position of U.S. District Judge. I won't go through every letter--the Record will speak for itself-- but when you have retired police officers, those who are not on duty now but who worked with her hands-on and who know the way she works with law enforcement, the way she engages with them when she was a public defender and so on--I think these letters speak for themselves. In closing, let me say this: The job of a U.S. Senator to recommend someone to be a judge is indeed a great honor, but it is an enormous responsibility. I take it very seriously, and I would only recommend somebody who was truly qualified to render impartial justice and bring the competency and the temperament to do that. I believe Ms. Xinis possesses competency, the judicial temperament, and a real commitment to equal justice under the law. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. [[Page S2811]] Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Mikulski, as the two Senators from Maryland, in strongly recommending the favorable consideration of Paula Xinis for the district court judgeship of Maryland. I first want to acknowledge the leadership of our senior Senator from Maryland in developing a process in which we screen the very most talented people for opportunities to serve on our Federal bench. This is a professional process that we have gone forward with under Senator Mikulski's leadership in order to try to get the very best on our courts. It is not a partisan issue at all. It is strictly looking for those who have the judicial temperament and experience to be able to be an outstanding member of the bench. We have done that on previous nominations that have been considered on this floor, and Paula Xinis follows in that tradition. I thank Senator Mikulski for the process that we went forward on in making this recommendation to President Obama. I might tell you, President Obama then forwarded the nomination to the Senate in March of last year--in March of 2015. It took 6 months for the Judiciary Committee to make its recommendations to the full floor in September of 2015. It was not a controversial nomination in the committee. The committee reviewed all of Ms. Xinis's background, record, everything that she has done, and on a very strong voice vote brought her forward to the full floor. So this is not a controversial nomination. Because of the delay, originally to fill the vacancy of Deborah Chasanow, who took senior status, it is now a judicial emergency. People of Maryland are in a desperate situation to have an adequate number of judges to handle the workload in our district. It is critical we move forward in the confirmation of this nominee. Senator Mikulski has pointed out how qualified this person is. I can tell you, over the last several months, I have been stopped on numerous occasions by attorneys and nonattorneys in Maryland saying: Why isn't Paula Xinis confirmed by now? She is a wonderful person. We have had experience with her. I have heard glowing comments about her dedication to our community, her professional competency, and her qualifications to serve on the U.S. district court. It is for that reason the ABA gave her the highest ratings in their review of her qualifications. She has been in the private practice of law at Murphy, Falcon & Murphy. After just 2 years, she was made a partner in that firm. She has been an assistant Federal public defender, showing her compassion to represent some of the most difficult cases in our criminal justice system. She was a law clerk for Judge Motz on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. She has devoted her life to understanding our legal system but also to carrying out its major charge to make sure we have equal access to justice under the law. She got her JD from Yale Law School, her BA from the University of Virginia. What I really appreciated, in getting to know Paula Xinis better during this confirmation process, was getting to know her family background; that is, to represent the American story. Her father was an immigrant from Greece, came over with very little resources. They were able to take advantage of the opportunities in this country as an immigrant family. Now Paula Xinis has been nominated by President Obama to serve on the district court for Maryland. Quite a success story, but Paula Xinis has never forgotten her background. She has always been giving back to our community. She is known for her pro bono work for her church members in the church she belongs to, but as Senator Mikulski pointed out, in working with the House of Ruth in a mentoring program, she has taken on some of the most difficult challenges to affect the lives of people who are less fortunate. She has an 11-year-old who is like her second son whom she has mentored and given a real opportunity in our community. She has the whole package. She will make a great district judge. Senator Mikulski mentioned the comments that were made on the floor in regard to her support for law enforcement for police officers. I hope, if anyone has any questions about that, read the letters Senator Mikulski put into the Record. I know of some of these cases. I know of the case of Timothy John Longo, who served with the Baltimore City Police Department and is now the chief of police for Charlottesville, VA. He said: I have absolutely no doubt that Paula will bring the competency and objectivity that is necessary to discharge the duty of such an important position. She has my confidence, respect and unfettered support. Then there is Thomas Schmidt, who Ms. Xinis represented when he was accused of wrongdoing as a police officer. She represented him in the most difficult challenge. Mr. Schmidt said: Throughout the entire ordeal, I spent countless hours with Paula and her team. They worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she had my back, and that she was dedicated to seeing that I was vindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year. She has been in the forefront of defending those who were defending us as first responders. There are other letters that have been written by police officers indicating that Paula Xinis contains exactly what they want to see in a judge: someone who is fair and impartial and who will carry out the rule of law in an objective manner. So for all of those reasons, we bring you a nominee who is eminently qualified and deserves the support of this body. We would urge our colleagues to support this nomination. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Today the Senate will vote on the nomination of Paula Xinis to be a judge for the District of Maryland. I will support that nomination. Mr. President, I come to the floor at this time to also talk about judges generally. I have been hearing the usual complaints from Members of the minority party regarding the pace of judicial nominations. I would urge my colleagues to step back and look at the bigger picture. The relevant number to consider is the number of confirmations during an entire Presidency. At this point in his Presidency, President George W. Bush had 303 judicial nominees confirmed. After tonight's vote, so far in his Presidency, President Obama will have 325 confirmed. Those are 22 more nominees than Bush had. So as we continue to hear complaints about how many judges are being confirmed, we should put these complaints in context. The simple fact is, President Obama has had quite a few more nominees confirmed than President Bush did. Further, I would note that as chairman, after this Wednesday, I will have held hearings for the same number of nominees this Congress has had as the last chairman of the committee did to this point during the last 2 years of President Bush's Presidency. At this point in the 2008 Congress--that would be the 110th Congress--the former chairman held hearings on 43 nominees. At the end of May of this year, we will have held hearings on 43 nominees thus far in the 114th Congress. I yield back all remaining time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time is yielded back. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Xinis nomination? Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Cotton), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Flake), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Sullivan), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Maine (Mr. King), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), [[Page S2812]] and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 34, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 72 Ex.] YEAS--53 Alexander Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Coats Collins Coons Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Kaine Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Portman Reed Reid Rubio Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse NAYS--34 Ayotte Barrasso Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Cochran Corker Cornyn Crapo Daines Ernst Fischer Gardner Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Lankford Lee McCain Murkowski Paul Perdue Risch Rounds Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Thune Tillis Wicker NOT VOTING--13 Cotton Cruz Enzi Flake Johnson King Moran Roberts Sanders Sullivan Toomey Vitter Wyden The nomination was confirmed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to reconsider is considered made and laid upon the table, and the President will be immediately notified of the Senate's action. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2805-S2812] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Zika Virus Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the Zika virus. We will have a vote on this tomorrow. Tonight I wish to speak about the need for us to move forward with emergency funding with regard to this virus. We need to combat it. It is spreading. It poses a threat to the safety of women, children, and the elderly. It is particularly important that we keep it from spreading because there is no known Zika vaccine or treatment. A lot of my constituents have asked me about this back home. This is a virus that has spread from Africa, to Asia, to Latin America, and now it is coming into our own country. It is spreading so quickly because it is insidious. It is difficult to test for it because it is usually confused with other viruses, like dengue. It can only be detected in a few days after you get it in the blood. Many of its symptoms in older adults are similar to other viruses, such as influenza, so it is tough to know whether you have it. It is typically contracted simply by being bitten by a mosquito, and two kinds of mosquitoes--both of which are in the United States--are the problem. We now know that it can also be transmitted by sexual activity. We are told that men may be able to sexually transmit the virus for months after the initial infection based on some experiences. So, again, this is a difficult issue. Some people may not even know they have it; yet they might be spreading it. The spread of the virus is accelerating. It took 60 years for Zika to make it out of Africa to the Pacific. Just 8 years after that, it reached the Western Hemisphere in Latin America. Today it has infected people in 62 countries, including the United States and 34 other countries in the Americas, so pretty much every country in the Americas is now infected with it. Hundreds of Americans have been infected. We know of nearly 500, including 48 pregnant women and 12 people in my home State of Ohio, in fact. Thus far, it looks as though all of the Americans who have become infected did so by traveling overseas, being infected by the mosquito or by sexual contact with someone who had Zika. The World Health Organization calls it ``a threat of alarming proportions'' because it is spreading so quickly and because it has serious consequences for the most vulnerable in our society, particularly the elderly--an older gentleman in Puerto Rico recently died of Zika--children, babies in the womb, which we will talk about in a second, and pregnant women. As Zika has spread, health officials have reported an increased incidence of babies born with a horrible birth defect [[Page S2806]] where a baby's head and brain are abnormally small. The consequences of this birth defect are absolutely tragic. These kids have seizures, slow development, intellectual disabilities, and often loss of hearing and vision. The consequences last a lifetime. There is no known cure for this disease. We don't want any child to have to suffer through that. It is in all of our interests to protect more babies from this syndrome. In Brazil, there have been more than 900 confirmed cases since Zika arrived, with another 4,000 suspected cases. These are conservative estimates, and they are rising. That is up from around an average of 150 each year--a 600-percent increase from year to year. Officials also tell us that Zika can cause what is called Guillain- Barre syndrome, which causes the body's immune system to attack its own nerves. It is a cruel syndrome, and in bad cases it can cause total paralysis and loss of sensation. This can happen to anyone, not just newborns but adults as well. These are just two of the neurological side effects that can result, and, like Zika, they are thought to be incurable. For most adults, Zika is not fatal, but to the most vulnerable, like the elderly and the unborn, it could be a lifetime of suffering, disability, or even death. I mentioned the man in Puerto Rico who died last week after being infected by Zika, a fellow American. His immune system began to attack the platelets in his blood, so they couldn't clot, and that was the effect for him. As Zika spreads, it becomes clearer than ever that our response has to be very aggressive, both domestically and internationally. It has to be aggressive, and therefore it has to be funded. That is why I think it is important that we deal with emergency funding before it is truly an emergency. I thank my colleagues for the steps they have already taken to improve our response. In March, this body passed and President Obama signed into law bipartisan legislation which I cosponsored with my friend Senator Franken that will give accelerated priority review at the Food and Drug Administration for new drugs and vaccines to treat Zika. This is very important, and I applaud the Senate for moving quickly and the administration for moving on that. It is a critical step. Right now, there is no cure and no treatment. President Obama has signed it into law. I am also grateful to the administration for redirecting more than $500 million of residual Ebola funds that were originally appropriated by Congress to deal with Ebola and were not necessary. They stopped using those funds for Ebola and shipped those funds over to Zika to stop it from spreading. I applaud them for that as well. Again, we have more work to do, and it is my view that we ought to move forward with emergency funding. There was a proposal--I believe it was finalized just last week, Thursday or Friday--from Senator Blunt and Senator Murray that goes a long way toward dealing with this issue. The majority of the funding is right here in the United States, while the rest will go to international immigration purposes so we can keep Zika from crossing our borders again. A lot of this funding goes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--the majority of it--to enhance mosquito control programs, improve infrastructure for testing for Zika, and expand the pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system, all of which are important. This is emergency funding, and I think it is necessary. Some funding also helps provide health services for pregnant women in Puerto Rico and invests in scientific research for a treatment or a vaccine. This is perhaps the most important thing we can do. These are critical priorities. I would also note that I am pleased that we have maintained the Hyde protections in this proposal, and I believe this is consistent with the goal of protecting innocent life, protecting these innocent babies from birth defects. We want this funding to be used to help preserve life and to help the vulnerable. We need to ensure adequate funding. We have to recognize the tools already at our disposal and use them. I have remained in contact with the Secretary of the Air Force as this virus has spread to make clear that in Ohio we have reservists at Youngstown Air Reserve Station who are ready to help. This Air Reserve Station in Youngstown, OH, is the home of the 910th Airlift Wing, which is the only fixed-wing aerial spray unit in the United States. It has been used by the military all over the United States. They have played key roles in other public health emergencies, including spraying millions of acres in Louisiana and Texas for mosquito abatement after Hurricane Katrina. I believe they could play that same role now. They are ready to do it, but frankly they need an upgrade in their equipment to be able to do it. As RADM Stephen Redd of the CDC told me in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, ``there could be a role for that airwing in locations that do not have [finely honed mosquito control enterprises].'' He said that a lot of counties in this country do not have that. He said: ``One of the things that we think is really important that the Zika virus outbreak is pointing out is the need to really revitalize those mosquito control efforts.'' I couldn't agree with him more. We need to revitalize these efforts to be sure we have them and use the tools that are at our disposal right now. If Zika were to spread around the country, it is incredibly important that we have this control effort. I hope we move forward on this in the next couple of days, send this legislation to the President for his signature, and get moving on dealing with the Zika emergency we have before us. People all over Ohio ask me about it because they are worried. We need to keep our constituents safe, and we need to give them peace of mind. Adopting the amendment I think we are going to have before us in the next couple of days is the best action we can take right now to achieve these goals, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to strongly support emergency funding for this purpose. Thank you. I yield back my time. THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been 5 weeks since the Senate last confirmed a judicial nominee. In that time, judicial vacancies have continued to increase. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership has repeatedly objected to unanimous consent motions made to overcome the obstruction of 20 judicial nominees. These are nominees who were voted out unanimously by committee and are awaiting a confirmation vote. The majority leader claims that President Obama's nominees have been treated fairly, but anyone paying attention to the Senate over the past 7 years knows that is not the case. It has been almost 2 months since Chief Judge Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Chief Judge Garland is widely respected, and prior to his nomination, he had repeatedly received praise from the very Republicans who now refuse to allow him to appear for a confirmation hearing. These same Republicans refuse to do their jobs as Senators while outside groups pour millions of dollars into television ads that seek to discredit Chief Judge Garland's record. Before there was even a Supreme Court nominee, one Republican aide promised conservatives were ``going to light this person up.'' Sadly, it appears they are making good on their threat while simultaneously refusing to allow him a public hearing where he could respond. Meanwhile, lower court nominees have stalled. Paula Xinis, whom we will vote on today, was nominated more than a year ago to fill an emergency vacancy--not just a regular vacancy but an emergency vacancy in Maryland. Since 2011, she has practiced as a criminal defense attorney at a law firm. Prior to that, she served in the Federal Public Defender's Office for the District of Maryland for 13 years, from 1998 to 2011. Ms. Xinis has extensive trial experience, representing hundreds of clients as a public defender and trying 16 cases to completion over the course of her career. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Ms. Xinis ``well qualified'' to serve in the district court. They gave Paula Xinis their highest rating. She is strongly supported by both Senators from Maryland, and her nomination was unanimously approved by the Judiciary [[Page S2807]] Committee by voice vote 8 months ago. All the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee approved her nomination from the Committee by unanimous voice vote. Senator Sessions came to the floor today to oppose Ms. Xinis's nomination based on her experience as an examiner of complaints against police officers in the District of Columbia. From 1995 to 2011, Ms. Xinis served as a complaint examiner in six cases where she made determinations on complaints brought against Metropolitan Police Department officers. At her Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator Sessions questioned Ms. Xinis about her experience and expressed concern that, in the six cases Ms. Xinis served as a complaint examiner, she sustained rulings against police officers in all of them. Senator Sessions questions Ms. Xinis's fairness to police officers based on her determinations in these six cases. However, as Senator Sessions said on the floor today, he does not question her personal qualifications or her integrity to be a Federal judge. And he also did not question her testimony before the Judiciary Committee in which she committed to being a fair and impartial judge, should she be confirmed. Furthermore, Ms. Xinis's record as a complaint examiner shows that each one of her six determinations was sustained by the chief of police; none of them was overturned. Her decisions could have been appealed and overturned if they were incorrect, but they were not. Paula Xinis has earned the express support of law enforcement and has defended police officers as an attorney on a number of occasions. For instance, in one case, she provided legal counsel to a Baltimore police officer unfairly accused of criminal wrongdoing. That officer wrote a letter of support for Ms. Xinis, where he said: ``Throughout the entire ordeal, I spent countless hours with Paula and her team. They worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she `had my back' and that she was dedicated to seeing that I was vindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all of the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year.'' This does not sound like a person who holds any biases against law enforcement. In addition to this officer, several other members of the law enforcement community have written in support of Ms. Xinis's nomination. After we actually vote on Paula Xinis's nomination today, there will still be 19 judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar waiting for a confirmation vote. Every single one of these nominees was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. Instead of allowing a vote on these nominees on a regular basis, the Republican leadership objects to the Senate being able to do our jobs. After today's vote, the next in line for consideration is a district court nominee from New Jersey and then a district court nominee from Nebraska. I know the Senators from New Jersey are pushing for a vote on the nominee to serve in their State. I hope the Republican Senators from Nebraska are urging their leadership to schedule the confirmation of Robert Rossiter, who was approved by unanimous voice vote in committee. That vacancy has been pending for over a year and a half. There is no good reason for votes on these nominees to be further delayed. Senator Grassley has indicated that Republicans will shut down the judicial nominations process in July, even though vacancies have risen from 43 to 81 since Republicans took over the majority. They have allowed vacancies to rise dramatically and now want to shut it down even though the judicial nominees pending are not controversial and we have numerous vacancies that need to be filled. This is wrong. Contrast this to the last 2 years of George W. Bush's administration, when Democrats were in control. At this same point in the Bush Presidency, Democrats had reduced vacancies to just 46. Because of Republican obstruction, our independent judiciary is struggling to perform its role under the Constitution. The Marshall Project recently interviewed several sitting judges to examine the impact judicial vacancies are having on our courts. Chief Judge Ron Clark of the Eastern District of Texas, which currently has three judicial emergency vacancies, said: ``We're managing the best we can-- but if they don't get us another judge soon, you could start to see some more draconian kinds of delays.'' There is a nominee to this court pending in the Judiciary Committee, but the Texas Senators, who both are members of the committee, have not returned their blue slips to allow that nominee to even receive a hearing. I hope the Texas Senators heed the call of Chief Judge Clark and get moving on their nominee. And I hope the Senate majority allows this body to return to regular order when it comes to processing judicial nominees. We have a constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on the President's nominees. The Constitution has not changed, but once President Obama took office, this body's normal practice for treating nominees turned for the worse. Deference to home State Senators was no longer the norm, and procedural delay after procedural delay quickly became the standard practice of the Republican caucus, whether they were in the minority or now in the majority. In a New York Times op-ed a week ago, former Judge Shira Sheindlin of the Southern District of New York warned that the Republicans' obstruction to district court nominees ``undermines public trust in the impartiality and legitimacy of the judiciary.'' I was heartened to hear the majority leader last week make the point that an election year is ``not an excuse not to do our work.'' I could not agree more. That is why in the last 2 years of the George W. Bush administration, when I served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we confirmed 68 of President Bush's judicial nominees. That is compared to a handful of President Obama's nominees that the Republicans have allowed. We confirmed 68 of President Bush's judicial nominees, and we confirmed right up to the time we went out for the elections in September, not in June or July or May. We have also confirmed more than a dozen Supreme Court Justices in Presidential election years, and many in this Senate served at the time. The last one we had, of course, was during President Reagan's final year in office. We did so because we knew the Supreme Court should not be held hostage to election-year politics; yet we are being held hostage to election-year politics because we are not doing our jobs. And the Supreme Court issued a couple more 4-to-4 opinions today. I urge the majority leader to heed his own advice and to schedule a confirmation vote for the pending lower court nominees, and I urge the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to follow suit by scheduling confirmation hearings for Chief Judge Garland so that we can do our jobs. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Judge Sheindlin's op-ed and the Marshall Project review be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Marshall Project, April 26, 2016] What Happens When There Aren't Enough Judges to Go Around? (By Eli Hager) The ninth seat on the Supreme Court has been vacant for two months. But Antonin Scalia's chair is not the only empty one in the vast federal judiciary, where several judgeships have remained unfilled for 30 months or more. Around the country, there are 84 of these vacancies, largely as a result of the Senate's historically low rate of confirming President Barack Obama's nominees. And since the beginning of last year, the number of unfilled seats and pending nominations have been steadily rising. Down in the gears of the justice system, all those absent judges have taken a toll. Because courts are obligated to find ways to meet speedy- trial rules, at least in criminal cases, the vacancies have not caused across-the-board delays. But by all accounts, the unconfirmed nominees--combined with what advocates say is an insufficient number of judgeships overall--have forced the system to find sometimes extraordinary ways to make do with the few judges available. Some judges, for example, are having to drive hundreds of miles to cover the empty seats. Less-qualified magistrate judges, senior judges who are supposed to be entering retirement, and visiting judges who fly in from other states, have all had to pitch in. And many of the remaining judges say that it's hard, with such a lack of personnel, to give every case the attention it deserves. In the worst-hit districts, including all four districts of Texas, some areas of Florida [[Page S2808]] and California, Middle Alabama, and elsewhere, the situation is now considered an ``emergency.'' Ron Clark, chief judge of the Eastern District of Texas, which has three judicial emergencies out of only eight total judgeships, says that ``we're managing the best we can--but if they don't get us another judge soon, you could start to see some more draconian kinds of delays.'' Judicial Vacancies in the Federal Courts In the past year, unfilled federal judgeships have been rising dramatically. Similarly, the number of seats on the bench considered ``emergencies''--vacant for many months with a large caseload per judge--and the number of White House nominations awaiting Senate confirmation have climbed. A 2014 study by the Brennan Center for Justice found that the vacancies led to a host of negative consequences. Among them were unresolved motions, habeas corpuspetitions waiting years to be heard (or being handled by law clerks instead of judges), judges spending less time on each case, and defendants pleading guilty because they believed a trial would not get the timely attention it deserved. And in civil proceedings, where the Speedy Trial Act does not apply, longer wait times for trial are becoming more common. Morrison C. England Jr., chief judge of the Eastern District of California, says that ``cases that aren't the priority are going to get pushed back for years, literally.'' In Middle Alabama, Ricky Martin, a pastor, had been allowing registered sex-offenders to stay in mobile homes surrounding his church--until the state legislature made it illegal for him to do so. Martin filed suit in August of 2014, and the local D.A. responded with a ``motion to dismiss'' a few months later. But a judge didn't get around to weighing in--in Martin's favor--until this April, and the case may not actually be resolved for two more years or longer. The process would have taken only three to four months if there were more judges available, says Randall Marshall, legal director of the ACLU of Alabama. But sometimes, the effect is the opposite: the proceedings get rushed. Brian McGiverin, a civil-rights lawyer in Austin, Texas, says that because there are so few judges, the remaining ones are all overbooked. As a result, they often ``give you a cramped amount of time for trial, regardless of how many witnesses you'd like to call.'' McGiverin recently assisted in the case of a woman named Abieyuwa Ikhinmwin, who claimed that she was racially profiled, handled with excessive force, and wrongfully arrested by police in San Antonio. He says the court tried to ``fast-track'' her lawsuit, threatening to dismiss it within 21 days unless she paid a fee and submitted additional information--which would not have happened when there were enough judges. Clark, chief judge in the nearby Eastern District of Texas, says that ``with so few of us, it's definitely harder to have the flexibility that a defense lawyer might want us to. So the answer sometimes has to be, `No, sorry, we can't offer that time in court.' '' Meanwhile, the consequences of too few judges are worsened in the most geographically expansive districts. ``When there's a missing judge in a state like ours,'' Clark says, ``it's not like we can walk down the hall and take care of a trial for him--the trip from Beaumont to Plano is five and a half hours, and that's if the traffic is good.'' He and the other judges in his district waste about two days a week on the road. ``We're one traffic accident away from the wheels falling off,'' he says. As an additional stop-gap measure, the worst-hit districts are relying on pinch hitters. In Middle Alabama, less-experienced magistrate judges (who are appointed directly by the district judges, rather than nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate) have for several years been doing work once reserved for the district judges, from taking guilty pleas to overseeing evidentiary hearings. The district is also getting last- minute help from visiting judges, who have traveled from Iowa and Florida to pitch in. ``When there are judges who come in from elsewhere,'' says Christine Freeman, executive director of the federal defender's office in Montgomery, Ala., ``they are strangers to us, to the prosecutor, to court officials, to the probation officers, to every single person involved in a case.'' ``That makes it very hard to predict outcomes for your client,'' Freeman adds. But the lack of judges has perhaps fallen hardest on senior judges, who, because they are typically over 70 or 80 years old, usually take on 50 percent or less of a full caseload. Instead, in Middle Alabama and elsewhere, their caseloads have been 150 or even 200 percent of normal. ``I'm 73, and I'd like to be able to say, `Look, I'm done, I want to spend more time with my family,' '' says Michael Schneider, one of the senior judges in Eastern Texas. ``I'm encouraged that the president has nominated someone, but I can't actually cut back until a nominee is approved.'' ``I'm going to be at this for awhile,'' Schneider adds. ``It's frustrating.'' England, the chief judge in Eastern California, says that senior judges are the only reason why vacancies haven't become more of a crisis. ``We are living and dying with our senior judges,'' England says. ``They're taking on cases they shouldn't have to, but that's what's saving us.'' Of course, federal courts being overburdened is the symptom of more than simply a lack of nominations and confirmations. Since 1990, Congress has not passed major legislation creating new judgeships, even as the war on drugs, and now the surge in prosecution of undocumented immigrants, have jammed up the system with exponentially more cases. As a result, by 2013, there was a 39 percent uptick in the number of overall filings, while only 4 percent more judges were added to handle all that extra work. Throw in the higher-than-normal number of vacancies, and it's a recipe for an overburdened judiciary. After a three- year wait, for instance, the Eastern District of California finally got a vacancy filled last October. But Chief Judge England says the crushing burden of too few judges hasn't lessened. ``One way or the other, Congress would need to give this district more judges,'' he says. ``We need help--we have too many trials. I'm booked for 2016 and 2017 already.'' ____ [From the New York Times, May 6, 2016] America's Trial Court Judges: Our Front Line for Justice (By Shira A. Scheindlin) The outcry over the Senate's failure to hold hearings on Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court is fully justified. But that isn't the only judiciary scandal on Capitol Hill. Even as the spotlight shines on the high court, the Senate has refused to confirm dozens of uncontroversial nominees to fill vacancies in the federal trial courts. Such obstructionism has become an everyday occurrence. Just last week, Senate Republicans refused to vote on 11 federal district court nominees whom the Judiciary Committee had already approved--even those who were supported by Republicans in their home states. During President George W. Bush's last two years in office, the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed about 57 district court judges. Since Republicans took power in 2014, the Senate has confirmed only 15 of President Obama's trial court nominees. This is an even bigger problem than Judge Garland's stalled nomination. Trial court judges do the bulk of the work in the federal court system: Last year nearly 375,000 new cases were filed, while the Supreme Court justices issued just under 75 opinions. And because most trial court decisions are never appealed, they become the final word in significant disputes that affect millions of Americans. I know this firsthand. I served as a trial judge for over 21 years, and stepped down from the bench last week. As I walked out of a federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan on one of my last days, an African-American United States marshal asked me if he could have a word. He explained that he had grown up in New York City's public housing, and thanked me for my 2013 decision in the ``stop and frisk'' case. (I ruled that the New York Police Department's practice in which police officers stopped hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers without reasonable suspicion, a vast majority of whom were innocent African- Americans and Latinos, was unconstitutional.) ``You just can't know what a difference this has made to so many people in my community,'' he said. ``You can't even imagine.'' But I think I can. At the policy's peak in 2011, officers stopped nearly 700,000 people. That number dropped to about 23,000 last year, and the policy change was not accompanied by a rise in serious crime, despite dire predictions to the contrary. As a result of my rulings and community outcry, the Police Department agreed to reforms, which include better record keeping, the use of police body cameras and the abandonment of racial profiling. Other examples abound. In 1974, Judge Jack Weinstein of the Eastern District of New York found the de facto segregation in a Coney Island public school to be unconstitutional, a ruling affirmed on appeal. The school was ultimately integrated under his supervision, and without the ``white flight'' that politicians had feared would result. And in one of the highest-profile civil rights cases ever in a trial court, Leonard about a decade later that both the housing and schools in Yonkers were intentionally segregated, and ordered construction of integrated housing in the city. An appeals court upheld this ruling, which, despite years of public protest, immensely improved the living conditions for thousands of Yonkers residents. The influence of district judges has likewise had an effect on national security. In the mid-2000s, Judge Alvin Hellerstein, also from the Southern District of New York, ordered the government to disclose photographs under the Freedom of Information Act that depict the abuse of Abu Ghraib detainees, which was affirmed by the appellate court. Judge Hellerstein also effectively forced the government to turn over the Department of Justice's infamous ``torture memos,'' which incited a national conversation about whether torture is ever appropriate. Not every decision by district court judges benefits the public: Last week Judge Thomas Schroeder of North Carolina's Middle District upheld myriad legislative changes to the state's voting rules that will result in reduced voting opportunities for minorities, unless reversed. [[Page S2809]] Whether Judge Garland should be confirmed or not, there can be no denying that Supreme Court nominations are inherently political. So it's no surprise that they are drawn out for ideological or partisan reasons. But district court nominations are different. Ideology is not the issue: Experience and competence are the only criteria. And yet the Senate majority's policy of delaying qualified district-court nominations on purely political grounds undermines public trust in the impartiality and legitimacy of the judiciary. This is especially worrisome because the public's understanding of how justice is administered is most likely based on its access to and experience with lower court proceedings. Presidential debates have focused on the Islamic State, trade pacts and immigration policy; meanwhile, the next president will most likely appoint 130 trial judges over the next four years. The public needs to know what's at stake. Trial judges must spot the issues, decide the outcomes and fashion the remedies in all kinds of disputes. I cannot force this Congress to do its job. But I urge voters not to forget the White House's power to appoint all judges when they choose the next president. Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I rise this evening in support of the nomination of Paula Xinis to serve on the District Court of Maryland. I know Senator Cardin will be coming to the floor shortly to also comment on Ms. Xinis's nomination. Senator Cardin and I recommended Ms. Xinis to President Obama with the utmost confidence in her abilities, talent, and competence for the job. She is a brilliant litigator and a dedicated public servant. The Judiciary Committee agreed with us, because they also voted her out of the committee unanimously. I thank Senator McConnell, the majority leader, for scheduling this vote; Senator Grassley for moving this nomination; and I also thank my very good and dear friend Senator Leahy, the vice chairman of the committee, who has been a strong advocate not only for this nomination but for moving all nominations forward, as voted out by the committee in a prompt way. As I talk about Ms. Xinis, I want the Presiding Officer to know that I have recommended several judicial nominees for district and appellate courts, and I take my advise and consent responsibility very seriously. When I recommend to the President a position on the district court, I have four criteria: absolute integrity, judicial competence and temperament, a commitment to core constitutional principles, and a history of civic engagement in Maryland. Ms. Xinis exceeds these expectations over and beyond. She has dedicated her career to the rule of law, achieving equal justice under the law and also being an advocate for the underdog. She is truly an outstanding nominee with a long history of public service--14 years as a Federal public defender, handling everything from the most simple misdemeanors to very complex white-collar crimes. She has also taken on extra duties, training staff and being an attorney supervisor of research and writing, proving time and time again how committed and dedicated she is. She worked as a clerk for the distinguished and esteemed Judge Diana Gribbon Motz, a well-respected judge on the Fourth Circuit. She also has been a member of the private sector as a senior trial partner in a private law firm in Baltimore, taking on complex civil litigation and protecting those who have been harmed by lead paint or carbon monoxide poisoning. Judge Motz, in recommending Ms. Xinis to me, said she is so intelligent and generous in terms of working very hard, in terms of knowing the law and practicing the law, but she also commented on her work ethic, praising her skill in the courtroom and her service to the community. She has mentored children, provided legal advice to at-need communities in Baltimore, and served on numerous bar associations. She has deep appreciation for the law and everything that it means. I do believe she will be an outstanding judge. There have been criticisms raised of Ms. Xinis, and the criticisms have centered around her support within the law enforcement community. Flashing yellow lights were raised by one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, asking whether she had an impartial attitude toward police officers. I have four letters here from retired police officers in Baltimore City all attesting to that. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: City of Charlottesville, Police Department, Charlottesville, VA, August 30, 2015. Re Letter in Support of Paula Xinis, for the position of United States District Judge for the District of Maryland. Hon. Charles Grassley, Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Honorable Senators Grassley and Leahy: My name is Timothy Longo and I currently serve as the Chief of Police in the City of Charlottesville, Virginia. I am a career law enforcement officer having previously served as a Colonel with the Baltimore City Police Department, retiring in March of 2000. In addition, to my professional training and experience, I am proud to have received my law degree from the University of Baltimore and was admitted to the Maryland Bar in December of 1993. For the past 25 years, I have had the honor of instructing thousands of law enforcement officers and administrators on matters of policy, law, and generally accepted policing practices. In addition to my sworn duties and responsibilities, I have served on many occasions as a police practices expert assisting both plaintiff and defense counsel in civil rights claims resulting from the actions of law enforcement officers, and the policies and practices related to those actions. It is in this capacity that I have come to know and respect Paula Xinis. I have come to learn that the Senate Judiciary Committee is presently considering Paula's candidacy and I respectfully write in support of her appointment. Paula and I met several years ago when I was asked to assist her in the evaluation of a civil rights claim that she had filed on behalf of a client related to the actions of a municipal law enforcement officer and the agency and municipality that employed that officer. The claim arose out of a use of force incident which resulted in serious and permanent injury. I firmly believe that cases such as this requires not only a thorough understanding of Section 1983 litigation and that of municipal liability, but an equally thorough understanding of police training, policy, and practice. For more than a year, I worked closely with Paula as she sought to better understand how a police officer is trained, the policies, principles, and practices that guide their work, as well as the manner in which police departments investigate incidents that result in force. What I discovered from the onset, and frankly what continued to impress me as I worked with Paula on this important matter, is the thoughtful and objective manner in which she approached both the facts and the theory of her client's case. Although the complaint she had advanced on behalf of her client depicted a series of facts that one may find was clearly contrary to generally accepted policing practices on the face of her client's complaint, she consistently endeavored to examine that complaint and the facts in the support of it through the lenses of a career law enforcement officer who had not only worked the streets of a large metropolitan city, instructed thousands in policing, but also served as a policy maker as to the training of police officers and practices that guide that work. She and I spoke countless times, and at great length, about not only that particular case but the way that police officers go about their work and the decisions that they make quickly and oftentimes without much deliberation. Paula was amazingly careful to reserve her own judgment and opinion as to the appropriateness of the officer's conduct and that of the agency's policy maker and listened carefully to my assessment of her claim and my opinion as to its propriety in light of my specialized training and experience. America's law enforcement officers are facing incredibly difficult challenges as we closely evaluate the manner in which we go about our work, carefully consider re-shaping and reforming our practices, and endeavor to strengthen the necessary relationships we have with those whom we serve. Undoubtedly, law enforcement officers, policy makers, and municipalities will more frequently find themselves being scrutinized by our trial and appellate courts, and ultimately the court of public opinion. The nature of our work and recent police-citizen interactions that have ended tragically makes this reality most certain. Thus, it has never been more critical to connect the right people to this important work; not just on the front line but throughout the criminal justice continuum. It is with a tremendous amount of pride and the utmost confidence that I respectfully ask the Senate of the United States to confirm the appointment of Paula Xinis to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. I have absolutely no doubt that Paula will bring the competence and objectivity that is necessary to discharge the [[Page S2810]] duties of such an important position. She has my confidence, respect, and unfettered support. If I can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to call upon me. Meanwhile, I thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration. Respectfully Submitted, Timothy John Longo, Sr., Chief of Police, City of Charlottesville, Virginia. ____ Police Department, Baltimore, Maryland, 4 September 2015. To: Senator Patrick Leahy. From: Sgt Brian Atwood. Subject: Recommendation for Paula Xinis to U.S. District Judge for Md.

I would proudly recommend Ms Xinis to the position of U.S District Judge for Maryland. Ms Xinis is a person of honor, integrity, fairness and would be outstanding in that position. In closing as a 20 year member of the law enforcement community, I know first hand the need to have judges that are well balanced, fair and great listeners.

That is why I proudly recommend Ms. Paula Xinis to the position of U.S. District Judge. Respectfully, Sgt. Brian Atwood. ____ Abingdon, MD, August 31, 2015. Re Letter in Support of Judicial Nomination of Paula Xinis for the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Hon. Charles Grassley, Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Senators Grassley and Leahy: Please accept this letter as support for the nomination of Paula Xinis as a United States District Judge for the District of Maryland. I was employed as a Police Officer with the Baltimore Police Department from 1987 until the time of my retirement in September 2014. While assigned to the Patrol Division, I handled calls for service related to violations of Maryland's handgun and narcotics laws. I also actively participated in shooting investigations. I also spent thirteen years assigned to the Tactical Unit/Quick Response Team. During my tenure with the Tactical Unit, one of the Unit's primary focus was serving high risk warrants for the Homicide and Robbery Units. When we weren't training, serving warrants and/or responding to barricade/hostage situations, we were utilized as suppression unit for illegal handguns and narcotics violations. For five straight years, my partner and I maintained the highest number of gun seizures/arrests and the largest narcotics cases within the Baltimore City Police Tactical Section. We received numerous commendations for our handgun arrests. Throughout the course of my career, I was called upon to testify in both the District and Circuit Courts in Baltimore City and County, as well as the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in Baltimore. Unfortunately, my successful career in law enforcement was derailed in 2014 when I encountered difficulties in connection with a call for service. I was improperly and unfairly accuse of wrongdoing which led to criminal charges. This was a new experience for me as I had never even been disciplined during my career. I felt vulnerable and betrayed. It was clear to me and my wife that we needed legal representation that would aggressively fight to vindicate me. My wife, whose practice is primarily the defense of civil cases, had been involved in a case in Baltimore City where Ms. Xinis represented the plaintiffs several years prior. During the course of that case, she would often remark that Ms. Xinis was a worthy advocate, yet fair and open-minded. Because of her experience with Ms. Xinis, my wife contacted her on a weekend to seek legal counsel and advice. From that point forward, Ms. Xinis made herself available to us, even if it was to simply reassure us that we were in good hands. Throughout the entire ordeal, I spent countless hours with Paula and her team. They worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she ``had my back'' and that she was dedicated to seeing that I was vindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all of the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year. I can personally attest to Ms. Xinis' legal acumen and her commitment to seeking justice, regardless of who the defendant may be. I observed her demonstrate the ability to forcefully argue her position to the court while being respectful to the court and other counsel. She can be a fierce advocate while maintaining a reassuring demeanor. My exposure to the judicial process throughout the course of my law enforcement career and as an officer who was wrongfully accused, has provided me with insight as to what is required to be an effective, fair and open-minded jurist. I can state without a doubt that Ms. Xinis possesses all of the necessary traits to be an asset to the federal bench in Maryland. The Committee could not find a more qualified candidate to fill the vacancy in Maryland. Sincerely, Thomas J. Schmidt, Sr. ____ September 1, 2015. Re Support of Paula Xinis, for United States District Judge for the District of Maryland. Dear Senator Patrick Leahy (Ranking Member) United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary: My name is Gregory Eads, Jr. I am a retired Baltimore City Police Officer. I served 22 years on the Baltimore City Police Department and retired in November 2014. I was currently assigned to the Bomb Squad and Emergency Services Unit where primarily I responded to suspicious package calls, bomb sweeps for visiting V.I.P's and stadium events. In my tenure as a police officer with the department I've acquired several skills and with worked in numerous specialized units. I have worked in Patrol, Bike(flex) squad, Drug enforcement unit, SWAT, Organized Crime Unit, Firearms Apprehension Strike Team. I am highly decorated officer that was awarded several unit citations, accommodations, and bronze star for valor. I've come to learn the senate Judiciary Committee is considering Paula for a United States District Judge. I want to extend my support for Paula as a candidate. Paula and I met at her law firm as she was preparing to defend a co- worker in criminal case. She was interviewing me as a character witness. During this exchange we discussed my family, experiences and my background being a second generation Police Officer in Baltimore City. We share some similarities on life and making a difference in the world. Paula has a young child, demanding career and is very well known among her peers. I was most impressed with her attention to detail, due diligence and preparation of the case. She is hardworking, open minded, and fair. I believe she would be an asset as she exemplifies the firm qualities that a United States District Court Judge possesses. As a police officer we need Judges that are fair, impartial and firm on the bench. With Paula being confirmed by the Senate Committee you will have that Judge I am referring to. I am grateful that I had the pleasure of meeting and working with Paula. Sincerely, Gregory Eads Jr., (Retired) BPD. Ms. MIKULSKI. One letter is from someone who is a 20-year veteran, working in the Western District. The Western District is where they filmed ``The Wire.'' It is rough, tough, and hardscrabble. This former police sergeant said: In closing, as a 20-year member of the law enforcement community, I know firsthand the need to have judges that are well balanced, fair and great listeners. . . . That is why I proudly recommend Ms. Paula Xinis to the position of U.S. District Judge. I won't go through every letter--the Record will speak for itself-- but when you have retired police officers, those who are not on duty now but who worked with her hands-on and who know the way she works with law enforcement, the way she engages with them when she was a public defender and so on--I think these letters speak for themselves. In closing, let me say this: The job of a U.S. Senator to recommend someone to be a judge is indeed a great honor, but it is an enormous responsibility. I take it very seriously, and I would only recommend somebody who was truly qualified to render impartial justice and bring the competency and the temperament to do that. I believe Ms. Xinis possesses competency, the judicial temperament, and a real commitment to equal justice under the law. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. [[Page S2811]] Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Mikulski, as the two Senators from Maryland, in strongly recommending the favorable consideration of Paula Xinis for the district court judgeship of Maryland. I first want to acknowledge the leadership of our senior Senator from Maryland in developing a process in which we screen the very most talented people for opportunities to serve on our Federal bench. This is a professional process that we have gone forward with under Senator Mikulski's leadership in order to try to get the very best on our courts. It is not a partisan issue at all. It is strictly looking for those who have the judicial temperament and experience to be able to be an outstanding member of the bench. We have done that on previous nominations that have been considered on this floor, and Paula Xinis follows in that tradition. I thank Senator Mikulski for the process that we went forward on in making this recommendation to President Obama. I might tell you, President Obama then forwarded the nomination to the Senate in March of last year--in March of 2015. It took 6 months for the Judiciary Committee to make its recommendations to the full floor in September of 2015. It was not a controversial nomination in the committee. The committee reviewed all of Ms. Xinis's background, record, everything that she has done, and on a very strong voice vote brought her forward to the full floor. So this is not a controversial nomination. Because of the delay, originally to fill the vacancy of Deborah Chasanow, who took senior status, it is now a judicial emergency. People of Maryland are in a desperate situation to have an adequate number of judges to handle the workload in our district. It is critical we move forward in the confirmation of this nominee. Senator Mikulski has pointed out how qualified this person is. I can tell you, over the last several months, I have been stopped on numerous occasions by attorneys and nonattorneys in Maryland saying: Why isn't Paula Xinis confirmed by now? She is a wonderful person. We have had experience with her. I have heard glowing comments about her dedication to our community, her professional competency, and her qualifications to serve on the U.S. district court. It is for that reason the ABA gave her the highest ratings in their review of her qualifications. She has been in the private practice of law at Murphy, Falcon & Murphy. After just 2 years, she was made a partner in that firm. She has been an assistant Federal public defender, showing her compassion to represent some of the most difficult cases in our criminal justice system. She was a law clerk for Judge Motz on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. She has devoted her life to understanding our legal system but also to carrying out its major charge to make sure we have equal access to justice under the law. She got her JD from Yale Law School, her BA from the University of Virginia. What I really appreciated, in getting to know Paula Xinis better during this confirmation process, was getting to know her family background; that is, to represent the American story. Her father was an immigrant from Greece, came over with very little resources. They were able to take advantage of the opportunities in this country as an immigrant family. Now Paula Xinis has been nominated by President Obama to serve on the district court for Maryland. Quite a success story, but Paula Xinis has never forgotten her background. She has always been giving back to our community. She is known for her pro bono work for her church members in the church she belongs to, but as Senator Mikulski pointed out, in working with the House of Ruth in a mentoring program, she has taken on some of the most difficult challenges to affect the lives of people who are less fortunate. She has an 11-year-old who is like her second son whom she has mentored and given a real opportunity in our community. She has the whole package. She will make a great district judge. Senator Mikulski mentioned the comments that were made on the floor in regard to her support for law enforcement for police officers. I hope, if anyone has any questions about that, read the letters Senator Mikulski put into the Record. I know of some of these cases. I know of the case of Timothy John Longo, who served with the Baltimore City Police Department and is now the chief of police for Charlottesville, VA. He said: I have absolutely no doubt that Paula will bring the competency and objectivity that is necessary to discharge the duty of such an important position. She has my confidence, respect and unfettered support. Then there is Thomas Schmidt, who Ms. Xinis represented when he was accused of wrongdoing as a police officer. She represented him in the most difficult challenge. Mr. Schmidt said: Throughout the entire ordeal, I spent countless hours with Paula and her team. They worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she had my back, and that she was dedicated to seeing that I was vindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year. She has been in the forefront of defending those who were defending us as first responders. There are other letters that have been written by police officers indicating that Paula Xinis contains exactly what they want to see in a judge: someone who is fair and impartial and who will carry out the rule of law in an objective manner. So for all of those reasons, we bring you a nominee who is eminently qualified and deserves the support of this body. We would urge our colleagues to support this nomination. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Today the Senate will vote on the nomination of Paula Xinis to be a judge for the District of Maryland. I will support that nomination. Mr. President, I come to the floor at this time to also talk about judges generally. I have been hearing the usual complaints from Members of the minority party regarding the pace of judicial nominations. I would urge my colleagues to step back and look at the bigger picture. The relevant number to consider is the number of confirmations during an entire Presidency. At this point in his Presidency, President George W. Bush had 303 judicial nominees confirmed. After tonight's vote, so far in his Presidency, President Obama will have 325 confirmed. Those are 22 more nominees than Bush had. So as we continue to hear complaints about how many judges are being confirmed, we should put these complaints in context. The simple fact is, President Obama has had quite a few more nominees confirmed than President Bush did. Further, I would note that as chairman, after this Wednesday, I will have held hearings for the same number of nominees this Congress has had as the last chairman of the committee did to this point during the last 2 years of President Bush's Presidency. At this point in the 2008 Congress--that would be the 110th Congress--the former chairman held hearings on 43 nominees. At the end of May of this year, we will have held hearings on 43 nominees thus far in the 114th Congress. I yield back all remaining time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time is yielded back. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Xinis nomination? Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Cotton), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Flake), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Sullivan), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Maine (Mr. King), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), [[Page S2812]] and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 34, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 72 Ex.] YEAS--53 Alexander Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Coats Collins Coons Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Kaine Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Portman Reed Reid Rubio Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse NAYS--34 Ayotte Barrasso Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Cochran Corker Cornyn Crapo Daines Ernst Fischer Gardner Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Lankford Lee McCain Murkowski Paul Perdue Risch Rounds Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Thune Tillis Wicker NOT VOTING--13 Cotton Cruz Enzi Flake Johnson King Moran Roberts Sanders Sullivan Toomey Vitter Wyden The nomination was confirmed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to reconsider is considered made and laid upon the table, and the President will be immediately notified of the Senate's action. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2805-S2812] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Zika Virus Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the Zika virus. We will have a vote on this tomorrow. Tonight I wish to speak about the need for us to move forward with emergency funding with regard to this virus. We need to combat it. It is spreading. It poses a threat to the safety of women, children, and the elderly. It is particularly important that we keep it from spreading because there is no known Zika vaccine or treatment. A lot of my constituents have asked me about this back home. This is a virus that has spread from Africa, to Asia, to Latin America, and now it is coming into our own country. It is spreading so quickly because it is insidious. It is difficult to test for it because it is usually confused with other viruses, like dengue. It can only be detected in a few days after you get it in the blood. Many of its symptoms in older adults are similar to other viruses, such as influenza, so it is tough to know whether you have it. It is typically contracted simply by being bitten by a mosquito, and two kinds of mosquitoes--both of which are in the United States--are the problem. We now know that it can also be transmitted by sexual activity. We are told that men may be able to sexually transmit the virus for months after the initial infection based on some experiences. So, again, this is a difficult issue. Some people may not even know they have it; yet they might be spreading it. The spread of the virus is accelerating. It took 60 years for Zika to make it out of Africa to the Pacific. Just 8 years after that, it reached the Western Hemisphere in Latin America. Today it has infected people in 62 countries, including the United States and 34 other countries in the Americas, so pretty much every country in the Americas is now infected with it. Hundreds of Americans have been infected. We know of nearly 500, including 48 pregnant women and 12 people in my home State of Ohio, in fact. Thus far, it looks as though all of the Americans who have become infected did so by traveling overseas, being infected by the mosquito or by sexual contact with someone who had Zika. The World Health Organization calls it ``a threat of alarming proportions'' because it is spreading so quickly and because it has serious consequences for the most vulnerable in our society, particularly the elderly--an older gentleman in Puerto Rico recently died of Zika--children, babies in the womb, which we will talk about in a second, and pregnant women. As Zika has spread, health officials have reported an increased incidence of babies born with a horrible birth defect [[Page S2806]] where a baby's head and brain are abnormally small. The consequences of this birth defect are absolutely tragic. These kids have seizures, slow development, intellectual disabilities, and often loss of hearing and vision. The consequences last a lifetime. There is no known cure for this disease. We don't want any child to have to suffer through that. It is in all of our interests to protect more babies from this syndrome. In Brazil, there have been more than 900 confirmed cases since Zika arrived, with another 4,000 suspected cases. These are conservative estimates, and they are rising. That is up from around an average of 150 each year--a 600-percent increase from year to year. Officials also tell us that Zika can cause what is called Guillain- Barre syndrome, which causes the body's immune system to attack its own nerves. It is a cruel syndrome, and in bad cases it can cause total paralysis and loss of sensation. This can happen to anyone, not just newborns but adults as well. These are just two of the neurological side effects that can result, and, like Zika, they are thought to be incurable. For most adults, Zika is not fatal, but to the most vulnerable, like the elderly and the unborn, it could be a lifetime of suffering, disability, or even death. I mentioned the man in Puerto Rico who died last week after being infected by Zika, a fellow American. His immune system began to attack the platelets in his blood, so they couldn't clot, and that was the effect for him. As Zika spreads, it becomes clearer than ever that our response has to be very aggressive, both domestically and internationally. It has to be aggressive, and therefore it has to be funded. That is why I think it is important that we deal with emergency funding before it is truly an emergency. I thank my colleagues for the steps they have already taken to improve our response. In March, this body passed and President Obama signed into law bipartisan legislation which I cosponsored with my friend Senator Franken that will give accelerated priority review at the Food and Drug Administration for new drugs and vaccines to treat Zika. This is very important, and I applaud the Senate for moving quickly and the administration for moving on that. It is a critical step. Right now, there is no cure and no treatment. President Obama has signed it into law. I am also grateful to the administration for redirecting more than $500 million of residual Ebola funds that were originally appropriated by Congress to deal with Ebola and were not necessary. They stopped using those funds for Ebola and shipped those funds over to Zika to stop it from spreading. I applaud them for that as well. Again, we have more work to do, and it is my view that we ought to move forward with emergency funding. There was a proposal--I believe it was finalized just last week, Thursday or Friday--from Senator Blunt and Senator Murray that goes a long way toward dealing with this issue. The majority of the funding is right here in the United States, while the rest will go to international immigration purposes so we can keep Zika from crossing our borders again. A lot of this funding goes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--the majority of it--to enhance mosquito control programs, improve infrastructure for testing for Zika, and expand the pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system, all of which are important. This is emergency funding, and I think it is necessary. Some funding also helps provide health services for pregnant women in Puerto Rico and invests in scientific research for a treatment or a vaccine. This is perhaps the most important thing we can do. These are critical priorities. I would also note that I am pleased that we have maintained the Hyde protections in this proposal, and I believe this is consistent with the goal of protecting innocent life, protecting these innocent babies from birth defects. We want this funding to be used to help preserve life and to help the vulnerable. We need to ensure adequate funding. We have to recognize the tools already at our disposal and use them. I have remained in contact with the Secretary of the Air Force as this virus has spread to make clear that in Ohio we have reservists at Youngstown Air Reserve Station who are ready to help. This Air Reserve Station in Youngstown, OH, is the home of the 910th Airlift Wing, which is the only fixed-wing aerial spray unit in the United States. It has been used by the military all over the United States. They have played key roles in other public health emergencies, including spraying millions of acres in Louisiana and Texas for mosquito abatement after Hurricane Katrina. I believe they could play that same role now. They are ready to do it, but frankly they need an upgrade in their equipment to be able to do it. As RADM Stephen Redd of the CDC told me in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, ``there could be a role for that airwing in locations that do not have [finely honed mosquito control enterprises].'' He said that a lot of counties in this country do not have that. He said: ``One of the things that we think is really important that the Zika virus outbreak is pointing out is the need to really revitalize those mosquito control efforts.'' I couldn't agree with him more. We need to revitalize these efforts to be sure we have them and use the tools that are at our disposal right now. If Zika were to spread around the country, it is incredibly important that we have this control effort. I hope we move forward on this in the next couple of days, send this legislation to the President for his signature, and get moving on dealing with the Zika emergency we have before us. People all over Ohio ask me about it because they are worried. We need to keep our constituents safe, and we need to give them peace of mind. Adopting the amendment I think we are going to have before us in the next couple of days is the best action we can take right now to achieve these goals, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to strongly support emergency funding for this purpose. Thank you. I yield back my time. THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been 5 weeks since the Senate last confirmed a judicial nominee. In that time, judicial vacancies have continued to increase. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership has repeatedly objected to unanimous consent motions made to overcome the obstruction of 20 judicial nominees. These are nominees who were voted out unanimously by committee and are awaiting a confirmation vote. The majority leader claims that President Obama's nominees have been treated fairly, but anyone paying attention to the Senate over the past 7 years knows that is not the case. It has been almost 2 months since Chief Judge Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Chief Judge Garland is widely respected, and prior to his nomination, he had repeatedly received praise from the very Republicans who now refuse to allow him to appear for a confirmation hearing. These same Republicans refuse to do their jobs as Senators while outside groups pour millions of dollars into television ads that seek to discredit Chief Judge Garland's record. Before there was even a Supreme Court nominee, one Republican aide promised conservatives were ``going to light this person up.'' Sadly, it appears they are making good on their threat while simultaneously refusing to allow him a public hearing where he could respond. Meanwhile, lower court nominees have stalled. Paula Xinis, whom we will vote on today, was nominated more than a year ago to fill an emergency vacancy--not just a regular vacancy but an emergency vacancy in Maryland. Since 2011, she has practiced as a criminal defense attorney at a law firm. Prior to that, she served in the Federal Public Defender's Office for the District of Maryland for 13 years, from 1998 to 2011. Ms. Xinis has extensive trial experience, representing hundreds of clients as a public defender and trying 16 cases to completion over the course of her career. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Ms. Xinis ``well qualified'' to serve in the district court. They gave Paula Xinis their highest rating. She is strongly supported by both Senators from Maryland, and her nomination was unanimously approved by the Judiciary [[Page S2807]] Committee by voice vote 8 months ago. All the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee approved her nomination from the Committee by unanimous voice vote. Senator Sessions came to the floor today to oppose Ms. Xinis's nomination based on her experience as an examiner of complaints against police officers in the District of Columbia. From 1995 to 2011, Ms. Xinis served as a complaint examiner in six cases where she made determinations on complaints brought against Metropolitan Police Department officers. At her Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator Sessions questioned Ms. Xinis about her experience and expressed concern that, in the six cases Ms. Xinis served as a complaint examiner, she sustained rulings against police officers in all of them. Senator Sessions questions Ms. Xinis's fairness to police officers based on her determinations in these six cases. However, as Senator Sessions said on the floor today, he does not question her personal qualifications or her integrity to be a Federal judge. And he also did not question her testimony before the Judiciary Committee in which she committed to being a fair and impartial judge, should she be confirmed. Furthermore, Ms. Xinis's record as a complaint examiner shows that each one of her six determinations was sustained by the chief of police; none of them was overturned. Her decisions could have been appealed and overturned if they were incorrect, but they were not. Paula Xinis has earned the express support of law enforcement and has defended police officers as an attorney on a number of occasions. For instance, in one case, she provided legal counsel to a Baltimore police officer unfairly accused of criminal wrongdoing. That officer wrote a letter of support for Ms. Xinis, where he said: ``Throughout the entire ordeal, I spent countless hours with Paula and her team. They worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she `had my back' and that she was dedicated to seeing that I was vindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all of the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year.'' This does not sound like a person who holds any biases against law enforcement. In addition to this officer, several other members of the law enforcement community have written in support of Ms. Xinis's nomination. After we actually vote on Paula Xinis's nomination today, there will still be 19 judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar waiting for a confirmation vote. Every single one of these nominees was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. Instead of allowing a vote on these nominees on a regular basis, the Republican leadership objects to the Senate being able to do our jobs. After today's vote, the next in line for consideration is a district court nominee from New Jersey and then a district court nominee from Nebraska. I know the Senators from New Jersey are pushing for a vote on the nominee to serve in their State. I hope the Republican Senators from Nebraska are urging their leadership to schedule the confirmation of Robert Rossiter, who was approved by unanimous voice vote in committee. That vacancy has been pending for over a year and a half. There is no good reason for votes on these nominees to be further delayed. Senator Grassley has indicated that Republicans will shut down the judicial nominations process in July, even though vacancies have risen from 43 to 81 since Republicans took over the majority. They have allowed vacancies to rise dramatically and now want to shut it down even though the judicial nominees pending are not controversial and we have numerous vacancies that need to be filled. This is wrong. Contrast this to the last 2 years of George W. Bush's administration, when Democrats were in control. At this same point in the Bush Presidency, Democrats had reduced vacancies to just 46. Because of Republican obstruction, our independent judiciary is struggling to perform its role under the Constitution. The Marshall Project recently interviewed several sitting judges to examine the impact judicial vacancies are having on our courts. Chief Judge Ron Clark of the Eastern District of Texas, which currently has three judicial emergency vacancies, said: ``We're managing the best we can-- but if they don't get us another judge soon, you could start to see some more draconian kinds of delays.'' There is a nominee to this court pending in the Judiciary Committee, but the Texas Senators, who both are members of the committee, have not returned their blue slips to allow that nominee to even receive a hearing. I hope the Texas Senators heed the call of Chief Judge Clark and get moving on their nominee. And I hope the Senate majority allows this body to return to regular order when it comes to processing judicial nominees. We have a constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on the President's nominees. The Constitution has not changed, but once President Obama took office, this body's normal practice for treating nominees turned for the worse. Deference to home State Senators was no longer the norm, and procedural delay after procedural delay quickly became the standard practice of the Republican caucus, whether they were in the minority or now in the majority. In a New York Times op-ed a week ago, former Judge Shira Sheindlin of the Southern District of New York warned that the Republicans' obstruction to district court nominees ``undermines public trust in the impartiality and legitimacy of the judiciary.'' I was heartened to hear the majority leader last week make the point that an election year is ``not an excuse not to do our work.'' I could not agree more. That is why in the last 2 years of the George W. Bush administration, when I served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we confirmed 68 of President Bush's judicial nominees. That is compared to a handful of President Obama's nominees that the Republicans have allowed. We confirmed 68 of President Bush's judicial nominees, and we confirmed right up to the time we went out for the elections in September, not in June or July or May. We have also confirmed more than a dozen Supreme Court Justices in Presidential election years, and many in this Senate served at the time. The last one we had, of course, was during President Reagan's final year in office. We did so because we knew the Supreme Court should not be held hostage to election-year politics; yet we are being held hostage to election-year politics because we are not doing our jobs. And the Supreme Court issued a couple more 4-to-4 opinions today. I urge the majority leader to heed his own advice and to schedule a confirmation vote for the pending lower court nominees, and I urge the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to follow suit by scheduling confirmation hearings for Chief Judge Garland so that we can do our jobs. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Judge Sheindlin's op-ed and the Marshall Project review be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Marshall Project, April 26, 2016] What Happens When There Aren't Enough Judges to Go Around? (By Eli Hager) The ninth seat on the Supreme Court has been vacant for two months. But Antonin Scalia's chair is not the only empty one in the vast federal judiciary, where several judgeships have remained unfilled for 30 months or more. Around the country, there are 84 of these vacancies, largely as a result of the Senate's historically low rate of confirming President Barack Obama's nominees. And since the beginning of last year, the number of unfilled seats and pending nominations have been steadily rising. Down in the gears of the justice system, all those absent judges have taken a toll. Because courts are obligated to find ways to meet speedy- trial rules, at least in criminal cases, the vacancies have not caused across-the-board delays. But by all accounts, the unconfirmed nominees--combined with what advocates say is an insufficient number of judgeships overall--have forced the system to find sometimes extraordinary ways to make do with the few judges available. Some judges, for example, are having to drive hundreds of miles to cover the empty seats. Less-qualified magistrate judges, senior judges who are supposed to be entering retirement, and visiting judges who fly in from other states, have all had to pitch in. And many of the remaining judges say that it's hard, with such a lack of personnel, to give every case the attention it deserves. In the worst-hit districts, including all four districts of Texas, some areas of Florida [[Page S2808]] and California, Middle Alabama, and elsewhere, the situation is now considered an ``emergency.'' Ron Clark, chief judge of the Eastern District of Texas, which has three judicial emergencies out of only eight total judgeships, says that ``we're managing the best we can--but if they don't get us another judge soon, you could start to see some more draconian kinds of delays.'' Judicial Vacancies in the Federal Courts In the past year, unfilled federal judgeships have been rising dramatically. Similarly, the number of seats on the bench considered ``emergencies''--vacant for many months with a large caseload per judge--and the number of White House nominations awaiting Senate confirmation have climbed. A 2014 study by the Brennan Center for Justice found that the vacancies led to a host of negative consequences. Among them were unresolved motions, habeas corpuspetitions waiting years to be heard (or being handled by law clerks instead of judges), judges spending less time on each case, and defendants pleading guilty because they believed a trial would not get the timely attention it deserved. And in civil proceedings, where the Speedy Trial Act does not apply, longer wait times for trial are becoming more common. Morrison C. England Jr., chief judge of the Eastern District of California, says that ``cases that aren't the priority are going to get pushed back for years, literally.'' In Middle Alabama, Ricky Martin, a pastor, had been allowing registered sex-offenders to stay in mobile homes surrounding his church--until the state legislature made it illegal for him to do so. Martin filed suit in August of 2014, and the local D.A. responded with a ``motion to dismiss'' a few months later. But a judge didn't get around to weighing in--in Martin's favor--until this April, and the case may not actually be resolved for two more years or longer. The process would have taken only three to four months if there were more judges available, says Randall Marshall, legal director of the ACLU of Alabama. But sometimes, the effect is the opposite: the proceedings get rushed. Brian McGiverin, a civil-rights lawyer in Austin, Texas, says that because there are so few judges, the remaining ones are all overbooked. As a result, they often ``give you a cramped amount of time for trial, regardless of how many witnesses you'd like to call.'' McGiverin recently assisted in the case of a woman named Abieyuwa Ikhinmwin, who claimed that she was racially profiled, handled with excessive force, and wrongfully arrested by police in San Antonio. He says the court tried to ``fast-track'' her lawsuit, threatening to dismiss it within 21 days unless she paid a fee and submitted additional information--which would not have happened when there were enough judges. Clark, chief judge in the nearby Eastern District of Texas, says that ``with so few of us, it's definitely harder to have the flexibility that a defense lawyer might want us to. So the answer sometimes has to be, `No, sorry, we can't offer that time in court.' '' Meanwhile, the consequences of too few judges are worsened in the most geographically expansive districts. ``When there's a missing judge in a state like ours,'' Clark says, ``it's not like we can walk down the hall and take care of a trial for him--the trip from Beaumont to Plano is five and a half hours, and that's if the traffic is good.'' He and the other judges in his district waste about two days a week on the road. ``We're one traffic accident away from the wheels falling off,'' he says. As an additional stop-gap measure, the worst-hit districts are relying on pinch hitters. In Middle Alabama, less-experienced magistrate judges (who are appointed directly by the district judges, rather than nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate) have for several years been doing work once reserved for the district judges, from taking guilty pleas to overseeing evidentiary hearings. The district is also getting last- minute help from visiting judges, who have traveled from Iowa and Florida to pitch in. ``When there are judges who come in from elsewhere,'' says Christine Freeman, executive director of the federal defender's office in Montgomery, Ala., ``they are strangers to us, to the prosecutor, to court officials, to the probation officers, to every single person involved in a case.'' ``That makes it very hard to predict outcomes for your client,'' Freeman adds. But the lack of judges has perhaps fallen hardest on senior judges, who, because they are typically over 70 or 80 years old, usually take on 50 percent or less of a full caseload. Instead, in Middle Alabama and elsewhere, their caseloads have been 150 or even 200 percent of normal. ``I'm 73, and I'd like to be able to say, `Look, I'm done, I want to spend more time with my family,' '' says Michael Schneider, one of the senior judges in Eastern Texas. ``I'm encouraged that the president has nominated someone, but I can't actually cut back until a nominee is approved.'' ``I'm going to be at this for awhile,'' Schneider adds. ``It's frustrating.'' England, the chief judge in Eastern California, says that senior judges are the only reason why vacancies haven't become more of a crisis. ``We are living and dying with our senior judges,'' England says. ``They're taking on cases they shouldn't have to, but that's what's saving us.'' Of course, federal courts being overburdened is the symptom of more than simply a lack of nominations and confirmations. Since 1990, Congress has not passed major legislation creating new judgeships, even as the war on drugs, and now the surge in prosecution of undocumented immigrants, have jammed up the system with exponentially more cases. As a result, by 2013, there was a 39 percent uptick in the number of overall filings, while only 4 percent more judges were added to handle all that extra work. Throw in the higher-than-normal number of vacancies, and it's a recipe for an overburdened judiciary. After a three- year wait, for instance, the Eastern District of California finally got a vacancy filled last October. But Chief Judge England says the crushing burden of too few judges hasn't lessened. ``One way or the other, Congress would need to give this district more judges,'' he says. ``We need help--we have too many trials. I'm booked for 2016 and 2017 already.'' ____ [From the New York Times, May 6, 2016] America's Trial Court Judges: Our Front Line for Justice (By Shira A. Scheindlin) The outcry over the Senate's failure to hold hearings on Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court is fully justified. But that isn't the only judiciary scandal on Capitol Hill. Even as the spotlight shines on the high court, the Senate has refused to confirm dozens of uncontroversial nominees to fill vacancies in the federal trial courts. Such obstructionism has become an everyday occurrence. Just last week, Senate Republicans refused to vote on 11 federal district court nominees whom the Judiciary Committee had already approved--even those who were supported by Republicans in their home states. During President George W. Bush's last two years in office, the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed about 57 district court judges. Since Republicans took power in 2014, the Senate has confirmed only 15 of President Obama's trial court nominees. This is an even bigger problem than Judge Garland's stalled nomination. Trial court judges do the bulk of the work in the federal court system: Last year nearly 375,000 new cases were filed, while the Supreme Court justices issued just under 75 opinions. And because most trial court decisions are never appealed, they become the final word in significant disputes that affect millions of Americans. I know this firsthand. I served as a trial judge for over 21 years, and stepped down from the bench last week. As I walked out of a federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan on one of my last days, an African-American United States marshal asked me if he could have a word. He explained that he had grown up in New York City's public housing, and thanked me for my 2013 decision in the ``stop and frisk'' case. (I ruled that the New York Police Department's practice in which police officers stopped hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers without reasonable suspicion, a vast majority of whom were innocent African- Americans and Latinos, was unconstitutional.) ``You just can't know what a difference this has made to so many people in my community,'' he said. ``You can't even imagine.'' But I think I can. At the policy's peak in 2011, officers stopped nearly 700,000 people. That number dropped to about 23,000 last year, and the policy change was not accompanied by a rise in serious crime, despite dire predictions to the contrary. As a result of my rulings and community outcry, the Police Department agreed to reforms, which include better record keeping, the use of police body cameras and the abandonment of racial profiling. Other examples abound. In 1974, Judge Jack Weinstein of the Eastern District of New York found the de facto segregation in a Coney Island public school to be unconstitutional, a ruling affirmed on appeal. The school was ultimately integrated under his supervision, and without the ``white flight'' that politicians had feared would result. And in one of the highest-profile civil rights cases ever in a trial court, Leonard about a decade later that both the housing and schools in Yonkers were intentionally segregated, and ordered construction of integrated housing in the city. An appeals court upheld this ruling, which, despite years of public protest, immensely improved the living conditions for thousands of Yonkers residents. The influence of district judges has likewise had an effect on national security. In the mid-2000s, Judge Alvin Hellerstein, also from the Southern District of New York, ordered the government to disclose photographs under the Freedom of Information Act that depict the abuse of Abu Ghraib detainees, which was affirmed by the appellate court. Judge Hellerstein also effectively forced the government to turn over the Department of Justice's infamous ``torture memos,'' which incited a national conversation about whether torture is ever appropriate. Not every decision by district court judges benefits the public: Last week Judge Thomas Schroeder of North Carolina's Middle District upheld myriad legislative changes to the state's voting rules that will result in reduced voting opportunities for minorities, unless reversed. [[Page S2809]] Whether Judge Garland should be confirmed or not, there can be no denying that Supreme Court nominations are inherently political. So it's no surprise that they are drawn out for ideological or partisan reasons. But district court nominations are different. Ideology is not the issue: Experience and competence are the only criteria. And yet the Senate majority's policy of delaying qualified district-court nominations on purely political grounds undermines public trust in the impartiality and legitimacy of the judiciary. This is especially worrisome because the public's understanding of how justice is administered is most likely based on its access to and experience with lower court proceedings. Presidential debates have focused on the Islamic State, trade pacts and immigration policy; meanwhile, the next president will most likely appoint 130 trial judges over the next four years. The public needs to know what's at stake. Trial judges must spot the issues, decide the outcomes and fashion the remedies in all kinds of disputes. I cannot force this Congress to do its job. But I urge voters not to forget the White House's power to appoint all judges when they choose the next president. Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I rise this evening in support of the nomination of Paula Xinis to serve on the District Court of Maryland. I know Senator Cardin will be coming to the floor shortly to also comment on Ms. Xinis's nomination. Senator Cardin and I recommended Ms. Xinis to President Obama with the utmost confidence in her abilities, talent, and competence for the job. She is a brilliant litigator and a dedicated public servant. The Judiciary Committee agreed with us, because they also voted her out of the committee unanimously. I thank Senator McConnell, the majority leader, for scheduling this vote; Senator Grassley for moving this nomination; and I also thank my very good and dear friend Senator Leahy, the vice chairman of the committee, who has been a strong advocate not only for this nomination but for moving all nominations forward, as voted out by the committee in a prompt way. As I talk about Ms. Xinis, I want the Presiding Officer to know that I have recommended several judicial nominees for district and appellate courts, and I take my advise and consent responsibility very seriously. When I recommend to the President a position on the district court, I have four criteria: absolute integrity, judicial competence and temperament, a commitment to core constitutional principles, and a history of civic engagement in Maryland. Ms. Xinis exceeds these expectations over and beyond. She has dedicated her career to the rule of law, achieving equal justice under the law and also being an advocate for the underdog. She is truly an outstanding nominee with a long history of public service--14 years as a Federal public defender, handling everything from the most simple misdemeanors to very complex white-collar crimes. She has also taken on extra duties, training staff and being an attorney supervisor of research and writing, proving time and time again how committed and dedicated she is. She worked as a clerk for the distinguished and esteemed Judge Diana Gribbon Motz, a well-respected judge on the Fourth Circuit. She also has been a member of the private sector as a senior trial partner in a private law firm in Baltimore, taking on complex civil litigation and protecting those who have been harmed by lead paint or carbon monoxide poisoning. Judge Motz, in recommending Ms. Xinis to me, said she is so intelligent and generous in terms of working very hard, in terms of knowing the law and practicing the law, but she also commented on her work ethic, praising her skill in the courtroom and her service to the community. She has mentored children, provided legal advice to at-need communities in Baltimore, and served on numerous bar associations. She has deep appreciation for the law and everything that it means. I do believe she will be an outstanding judge. There have been criticisms raised of Ms. Xinis, and the criticisms have centered around her support within the law enforcement community. Flashing yellow lights were raised by one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, asking whether she had an impartial attitude toward police officers. I have four letters here from retired police officers in Baltimore City all attesting to that. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: City of Charlottesville, Police Department, Charlottesville, VA, August 30, 2015. Re Letter in Support of Paula Xinis, for the position of United States District Judge for the District of Maryland. Hon. Charles Grassley, Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Honorable Senators Grassley and Leahy: My name is Timothy Longo and I currently serve as the Chief of Police in the City of Charlottesville, Virginia. I am a career law enforcement officer having previously served as a Colonel with the Baltimore City Police Department, retiring in March of 2000. In addition, to my professional training and experience, I am proud to have received my law degree from the University of Baltimore and was admitted to the Maryland Bar in December of 1993. For the past 25 years, I have had the honor of instructing thousands of law enforcement officers and administrators on matters of policy, law, and generally accepted policing practices. In addition to my sworn duties and responsibilities, I have served on many occasions as a police practices expert assisting both plaintiff and defense counsel in civil rights claims resulting from the actions of law enforcement officers, and the policies and practices related to those actions. It is in this capacity that I have come to know and respect Paula Xinis. I have come to learn that the Senate Judiciary Committee is presently considering Paula's candidacy and I respectfully write in support of her appointment. Paula and I met several years ago when I was asked to assist her in the evaluation of a civil rights claim that she had filed on behalf of a client related to the actions of a municipal law enforcement officer and the agency and municipality that employed that officer. The claim arose out of a use of force incident which resulted in serious and permanent injury. I firmly believe that cases such as this requires not only a thorough understanding of Section 1983 litigation and that of municipal liability, but an equally thorough understanding of police training, policy, and practice. For more than a year, I worked closely with Paula as she sought to better understand how a police officer is trained, the policies, principles, and practices that guide their work, as well as the manner in which police departments investigate incidents that result in force. What I discovered from the onset, and frankly what continued to impress me as I worked with Paula on this important matter, is the thoughtful and objective manner in which she approached both the facts and the theory of her client's case. Although the complaint she had advanced on behalf of her client depicted a series of facts that one may find was clearly contrary to generally accepted policing practices on the face of her client's complaint, she consistently endeavored to examine that complaint and the facts in the support of it through the lenses of a career law enforcement officer who had not only worked the streets of a large metropolitan city, instructed thousands in policing, but also served as a policy maker as to the training of police officers and practices that guide that work. She and I spoke countless times, and at great length, about not only that particular case but the way that police officers go about their work and the decisions that they make quickly and oftentimes without much deliberation. Paula was amazingly careful to reserve her own judgment and opinion as to the appropriateness of the officer's conduct and that of the agency's policy maker and listened carefully to my assessment of her claim and my opinion as to its propriety in light of my specialized training and experience. America's law enforcement officers are facing incredibly difficult challenges as we closely evaluate the manner in which we go about our work, carefully consider re-shaping and reforming our practices, and endeavor to strengthen the necessary relationships we have with those whom we serve. Undoubtedly, law enforcement officers, policy makers, and municipalities will more frequently find themselves being scrutinized by our trial and appellate courts, and ultimately the court of public opinion. The nature of our work and recent police-citizen interactions that have ended tragically makes this reality most certain. Thus, it has never been more critical to connect the right people to this important work; not just on the front line but throughout the criminal justice continuum. It is with a tremendous amount of pride and the utmost confidence that I respectfully ask the Senate of the United States to confirm the appointment of Paula Xinis to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. I have absolutely no doubt that Paula will bring the competence and objectivity that is necessary to discharge the [[Page S2810]] duties of such an important position. She has my confidence, respect, and unfettered support. If I can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to call upon me. Meanwhile, I thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration. Respectfully Submitted, Timothy John Longo, Sr., Chief of Police, City of Charlottesville, Virginia. ____ Police Department, Baltimore, Maryland, 4 September 2015. To: Senator Patrick Leahy. From: Sgt Brian Atwood. Subject: Recommendation for Paula Xinis to U.S. District Judge for Md. Sir: My name is Sgt Brian Atwood; I am a twenty year veteran with the Baltimore Police Department, I started my career in May of 1995 in the Western District. During my career I have received three Bronze Stars for Valor, two Life Saving awards and have received numerous unit citations of. I have held several positions of authority include: Field Training Officer, Officer in Charge, Sergeant and Sergeant in Charge. I have been assigned to follow district units: Patrol, Flex Units, Drug Unit, and Firearm Instructor. I'm currently assigned to the departments, Special Operation Section. I have held tactical positions as both an officer and sergeant within the elite Emergency Service Unit. My current assignment is supervising sergeant of the K-9 unit. I am also a passed board member of Maryland's largest FOP with over 5000 active and retired members. As a member of FOP Lodge #3, I have held numerous positions within our lodge to include. Grievance Rep, Grievance Chairman, P.A.C funds Chairman, Legal Advisory Board, Contract Team Chairman, and was elected to the position of Vice President for our Lodge. It is my understanding that the Senate Judiciary Committee will be considering Ms. Paula Xinis for United States District Judge. I would proudly recommend Ms Xinis to the position of U.S District Judge for Maryland. Ms Xinis is a person of honor, integrity, fairness and would be outstanding in that position. In closing as a 20 year member of the law enforcement community, I know first hand the need to have judges that are well balanced, fair and great listeners. It is equally important that our judges take the rule of law and always apply it equally, with understanding and compassion in there decision. That is why I proudly recommend Ms. Paula Xinis to the position of U.S. District Judge. Respectfully, Sgt. Brian Atwood. ____ Abingdon, MD, August 31, 2015. Re Letter in Support of Judicial Nomination of Paula Xinis for the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Hon. Charles Grassley, Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Senators Grassley and Leahy: Please accept this letter as support for the nomination of Paula Xinis as a United States District Judge for the District of Maryland. I was employed as a Police Officer with the Baltimore Police Department from 1987 until the time of my retirement in September 2014. While assigned to the Patrol Division, I handled calls for service related to violations of Maryland's handgun and narcotics laws. I also actively participated in shooting investigations. I also spent thirteen years assigned to the Tactical Unit/Quick Response Team. During my tenure with the Tactical Unit, one of the Unit's primary focus was serving high risk warrants for the Homicide and Robbery Units. When we weren't training, serving warrants and/or responding to barricade/hostage situations, we were utilized as suppression unit for illegal handguns and narcotics violations. For five straight years, my partner and I maintained the highest number of gun seizures/arrests and the largest narcotics cases within the Baltimore City Police Tactical Section. We received numerous commendations for our handgun arrests. Throughout the course of my career, I was called upon to testify in both the District and Circuit Courts in Baltimore City and County, as well as the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in Baltimore. Unfortunately, my successful career in law enforcement was derailed in 2014 when I encountered difficulties in connection with a call for service. I was improperly and unfairly accuse of wrongdoing which led to criminal charges. This was a new experience for me as I had never even been disciplined during my career. I felt vulnerable and betrayed. It was clear to me and my wife that we needed legal representation that would aggressively fight to vindicate me. My wife, whose practice is primarily the defense of civil cases, had been involved in a case in Baltimore City where Ms. Xinis represented the plaintiffs several years prior. During the course of that case, she would often remark that Ms. Xinis was a worthy advocate, yet fair and open-minded. Because of her experience with Ms. Xinis, my wife contacted her on a weekend to seek legal counsel and advice. From that point forward, Ms. Xinis made herself available to us, even if it was to simply reassure us that we were in good hands. Throughout the entire ordeal, I spent countless hours with Paula and her team. They worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she ``had my back'' and that she was dedicated to seeing that I was vindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all of the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year. I can personally attest to Ms. Xinis' legal acumen and her commitment to seeking justice, regardless of who the defendant may be. I observed her demonstrate the ability to forcefully argue her position to the court while being respectful to the court and other counsel. She can be a fierce advocate while maintaining a reassuring demeanor. My exposure to the judicial process throughout the course of my law enforcement career and as an officer who was wrongfully accused, has provided me with insight as to what is required to be an effective, fair and open-minded jurist. I can state without a doubt that Ms. Xinis possesses all of the necessary traits to be an asset to the federal bench in Maryland. The Committee could not find a more qualified candidate to fill the vacancy in Maryland. Sincerely, Thomas J. Schmidt, Sr. ____ September 1, 2015. Re Support of Paula Xinis, for United States District Judge for the District of Maryland. Dear Senator Patrick Leahy (Ranking Member) United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary: My name is Gregory Eads, Jr. I am a retired Baltimore City Police Officer. I served 22 years on the Baltimore City Police Department and retired in November 2014. I was currently assigned to the Bomb Squad and Emergency Services Unit where primarily I responded to suspicious package calls, bomb sweeps for visiting V.I.P's and stadium events. In my tenure as a police officer with the department I've acquired several skills and with worked in numerous specialized units. I have worked in Patrol, Bike(flex) squad, Drug enforcement unit, SWAT, Organized Crime Unit, Firearms Apprehension Strike Team. I am highly decorated officer that was awarded several unit citations, accommodations, and bronze star for valor. I've come to learn the senate Judiciary Committee is considering Paula for a United States District Judge. I want to extend my support for Paula as a candidate. Paula and I met at her law firm as she was preparing to defend a co- worker in criminal case. She was interviewing me as a character witness. During this exchange we discussed my family, experiences and my background being a second generation Police Officer in Baltimore City. We share some similarities on life and making a difference in the world. Paula has a young child, demanding career and is very well known among her peers. I was most impressed with her attention to detail, due diligence and preparation of the case. She is hardworking, open minded, and fair. I believe she would be an asset as she exemplifies the firm qualities that a United States District Court Judge possesses. As a police officer we need Judges that are fair, impartial and firm on the bench. With Paula being confirmed by the Senate Committee you will have that Judge I am referring to. I am grateful that I had the pleasure of meeting and working with Paula. Sincerely, Gregory Eads Jr., (Retired) BPD. Ms. MIKULSKI. One letter is from someone who is a 20-year veteran, working in the Western District. The Western District is where they filmed ``The Wire.'' It is rough, tough, and hardscrabble. This former police sergeant said: In closing, as a 20-year member of the law enforcement community, I know firsthand the need to have judges that are well balanced, fair and great listeners. . . . That is why I proudly recommend Ms. Paula Xinis to the position of U.S. District Judge. I won't go through every letter--the Record will speak for itself-- but when you have retired police officers, those who are not on duty now but who worked with her hands-on and who know the way she works with law enforcement, the way she engages with them when she was a public defender and so on--I think these letters speak for themselves. In closing, let me say this: The job of a U.S. Senator to recommend someone to be a judge is indeed a great honor, but it is an enormous responsibility. I take it very seriously, and I would only recommend somebody who was truly qualified to render impartial justice and bring the competency and the temperament to do that. I believe Ms. Xinis possesses competency, the judicial temperament, and a real commitment to equal justice under the law. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. [[Page S2811]] Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Mikulski, as the two Senators from Maryland, in strongly recommending the favorable consideration of Paula Xinis for the district court judgeship of Maryland. I first want to acknowledge the leadership of our senior Senator from Maryland in developing a process in which we screen the very most talented people for opportunities to serve on our Federal bench. This is a professional process that we have gone forward with under Senator Mikulski's leadership in order to try to get the very best on our courts. It is not a partisan issue at all. It is strictly looking for those who have the judicial temperament and experience to be able to be an outstanding member of the bench. We have done that on previous nominations that have been considered on this floor, and Paula Xinis follows in that tradition. I thank Senator Mikulski for the process that we went forward on in making this recommendation to President Obama. I might tell you, President Obama then forwarded the nomination to the Senate in March of last year--in March of 2015. It took 6 months for the Judiciary Committee to make its recommendations to the full floor in September of 2015. It was not a controversial nomination in the committee. The committee reviewed all of Ms. Xinis's background, record, everything that she has done, and on a very strong voice vote brought her forward to the full floor. So this is not a controversial nomination. Because of the delay, originally to fill the vacancy of Deborah Chasanow, who took senior status, it is now a judicial emergency. People of Maryland are in a desperate situation to have an adequate number of judges to handle the workload in our district. It is critical we move forward in the confirmation of this nominee. Senator Mikulski has pointed out how qualified this person is. I can tell you, over the last several months, I have been stopped on numerous occasions by attorneys and nonattorneys in Maryland saying: Why isn't Paula Xinis confirmed by now? She is a wonderful person. We have had experience with her. I have heard glowing comments about her dedication to our community, her professional competency, and her qualifications to serve on the U.S. district court. It is for that reason the ABA gave her the highest ratings in their review of her qualifications. She has been in the private practice of law at Murphy, Falcon & Murphy. After just 2 years, she was made a partner in that firm. She has been an assistant Federal public defender, showing her compassion to represent some of the most difficult cases in our criminal justice system. She was a law clerk for Judge Motz on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. She has devoted her life to understanding our legal system but also to carrying out its major charge to make sure we have equal access to justice under the law. She got her JD from Yale Law School, her BA from the University of Virginia. What I really appreciated, in getting to know Paula Xinis better during this confirmation process, was getting to know her family background; that is, to represent the American story. Her father was an immigrant from Greece, came over with very little resources. They were able to take advantage of the opportunities in this country as an immigrant family. Now Paula Xinis has been nominated by President Obama to serve on the district court for Maryland. Quite a success story, but Paula Xinis has never forgotten her background. She has always been giving back to our community. She is known for her pro bono work for her church members in the church she belongs to, but as Senator Mikulski pointed out, in working with the House of Ruth in a mentoring program, she has taken on some of the most difficult challenges to affect the lives of people who are less fortunate. She has an 11-year-old who is like her second son whom she has mentored and given a real opportunity in our community. She has the whole package. She will make a great district judge. Senator Mikulski mentioned the comments that were made on the floor in regard to her support for law enforcement for police officers. I hope, if anyone has any questions about that, read the letters Senator Mikulski put into the Record. I know of some of these cases. I know of the case of Timothy John Longo, who served with the Baltimore City Police Department and is now the chief of police for Charlottesville, VA. He said: I have absolutely no doubt that Paula will bring the competency and objectivity that is necessary to discharge the duty of such an important position. She has my confidence, respect and unfettered support. Then there is Thomas Schmidt, who Ms. Xinis represented when he was accused of wrongdoing as a police officer. She represented him in the most difficult challenge. Mr. Schmidt said: Throughout the entire ordeal, I spent countless hours with Paula and her team. They worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. Although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she had my back, and that she was dedicated to seeing that I was vindicated. Thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year. She has been in the forefront of defending those who were defending us as first responders. There are other letters that have been written by police officers indicating that Paula Xinis contains exactly what they want to see in a judge: someone who is fair and impartial and who will carry out the rule of law in an objective manner. So for all of those reasons, we bring you a nominee who is eminently qualified and deserves the support of this body. We would urge our colleagues to support this nomination. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Today the Senate will vote on the nomination of Paula Xinis to be a judge for the District of Maryland. I will support that nomination. Mr. President, I come to the floor at this time to also talk about judges generally. I have been hearing the usual complaints from Members of the minority party regarding the pace of judicial nominations. I would urge my colleagues to step back and look at the bigger picture. The relevant number to consider is the number of confirmations during an entire Presidency. At this point in his Presidency, President George W. Bush had 303 judicial nominees confirmed. After tonight's vote, so far in his Presidency, President Obama will have 325 confirmed. Those are 22 more nominees than Bush had. So as we continue to hear complaints about how many judges are being confirmed, we should put these complaints in context. The simple fact is, President Obama has had quite a few more nominees confirmed than President Bush did. Further, I would note that as chairman, after this Wednesday, I will have held hearings for the same number of nominees this Congress has had as the last chairman of the committee did to this point during the last 2 years of President Bush's Presidency. At this point in the 2008 Congress--that would be the 110th Congress--the former chairman held hearings on 43 nominees. At the end of May of this year, we will have held hearings on 43 nominees thus far in the 114th Congress. I yield back all remaining time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time is yielded back. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Xinis nomination? Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Cotton), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Flake), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Sullivan), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Maine (Mr. King), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), [[Page S2812]] and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 34, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 72 Ex.] YEAS--53 Alexander Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Coats Collins Coons Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Kaine Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Portman Reed Reid Rubio Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse NAYS--34 Ayotte Barrasso Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Cochran Corker Cornyn Crapo Daines Ernst Fischer Gardner Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Lankford Lee McCain Murkowski Paul Perdue Risch Rounds Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Thune Tillis Wicker NOT VOTING--13 Cotton Cruz Enzi Flake Johnson King Moran Roberts Sanders Sullivan Toomey Vitter Wyden The nomination was confirmed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to reconsider is considered made and laid upon the table, and the President will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.

through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] zika virus mr. portman. madam president, i rise today to talk about the zika virus. we will have a vote on this tomorrow. tonight i wish to speak about the need for us to move forward with emergency funding with regard to this virus. we need to combat it. it is spreading. it poses a threat to the safety of women, children, and the elderly. it is particularly important that we keep it from spreading because there is no known zika vaccine or treatment. a lot of my constituents have asked me about this back home. this is a virus that has spread from africa, to asia, to latin america, and now it is coming into our own country. it is spreading so quickly because it is insidious. it is difficult to test for it because it is usually confused with other viruses, like dengue. it can only be detected in a few days after you get it in the blood. many of its symptoms in older adults are similar to other viruses, such as influenza, so it is tough to know whether you have it. it is typically contracted simply by being bitten by a mosquito, and two kinds of mosquitoes--both of which are in the united states--are the problem. we now know that it can also be transmitted by sexual activity. we are told that men may be able to sexually transmit the virus for months after the initial infection based on some experiences. so, again, this is a difficult issue. some people may not even know they have it; yet they might be spreading it. the spread of the virus is accelerating. it took 60 years for zika to make it out of africa to the pacific. just 8 years after that, it reached the western hemisphere in latin america. today it has infected people in 62 countries, including the united states and 34 other countries in the americas, so pretty much every country in the americas is now infected with it. hundreds of americans have been infected. we know of nearly 500, including 48 pregnant women and 12 people in my home state of ohio, in fact. thus far, it looks as though all of the americans who have become infected did so by traveling overseas, being infected by the mosquito or by sexual contact with someone who had zika. the world health organization calls it ``a threat of alarming proportions'' because it is spreading so quickly and because it has serious consequences for the most vulnerable in our society, particularly the elderly--an older gentleman in puerto rico recently died of zika--children, babies in the womb, which we will talk about in a second, and pregnant women. as zika has spread, health officials have reported an increased incidence of babies born with a horrible birth defect [[page s2806]] where a baby's head and brain are abnormally small. the consequences of this birth defect are absolutely tragic. these kids have seizures, slow development, intellectual disabilities, and often loss of hearing and vision. the consequences last a lifetime. there is no known cure for this disease. we don't want any child to have to suffer through that. it is in all of our interests to protect more babies from this syndrome. in brazil, there have been more than 900 confirmed cases since zika arrived, with another 4,000 suspected cases. these are conservative estimates, and they are rising. that is up from around an average of 150 each year--a 600-percent increase from year to year. officials also tell us that zika can cause what is called guillain- barre syndrome, which causes the body's immune system to attack its own nerves. it is a cruel syndrome, and in bad cases it can cause total paralysis and loss of sensation. this can happen to anyone, not just newborns but adults as well. these are just two of the neurological side effects that can result, and, like zika, they are thought to be incurable. for most adults, zika is not fatal, but to the most vulnerable, like the elderly and the unborn, it could be a lifetime of suffering, disability, or even death. i mentioned the man in puerto rico who died last week after being infected by zika, a fellow american. his immune system began to attack the platelets in his blood, so they couldn't clot, and that was the effect for him. as zika spreads, it becomes clearer than ever that our response has to be very aggressive, both domestically and internationally. it has to be aggressive, and therefore it has to be funded. that is why i think it is important that we deal with emergency funding before it is truly an emergency. i thank my colleagues for the steps they have already taken to improve our response. in march, this body passed and president obama signed into law bipartisan legislation which i cosponsored with my friend senator franken that will give accelerated priority review at the food and drug administration for new drugs and vaccines to treat zika. this is very important, and i applaud the senate for moving quickly and the administration for moving on that. it is a critical step. right now, there is no cure and no treatment. president obama has signed it into law. i am also grateful to the administration for redirecting more than $500 million of residual ebola funds that were originally appropriated by congress to deal with ebola and were not necessary. they stopped using those funds for ebola and shipped those funds over to zika to stop it from spreading. i applaud them for that as well. again, we have more work to do, and it is my view that we ought to move forward with emergency funding. there was a proposal--i believe it was finalized just last week, thursday or friday--from senator blunt and senator murray that goes a long way toward dealing with this issue. the majority of the funding is right here in the united states, while the rest will go to international immigration purposes so we can keep zika from crossing our borders again. a lot of this funding goes to the centers for disease control and prevention--the majority of it--to enhance mosquito control programs, improve infrastructure for testing for zika, and expand the pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system, all of which are important. this is emergency funding, and i think it is necessary. some funding also helps provide health services for pregnant women in puerto rico and invests in scientific research for a treatment or a vaccine. this is perhaps the most important thing we can do. these are critical priorities. i would also note that i am pleased that we have maintained the hyde protections in this proposal, and i believe this is consistent with the goal of protecting innocent life, protecting these innocent babies from birth defects. we want this funding to be used to help preserve life and to help the vulnerable. we need to ensure adequate funding. we have to recognize the tools already at our disposal and use them. i have remained in contact with the secretary of the air force as this virus has spread to make clear that in ohio we have reservists at youngstown air reserve station who are ready to help. this air reserve station in youngstown, oh, is the home of the 910th airlift wing, which is the only fixed-wing aerial spray unit in the united states. it has been used by the military all over the united states. they have played key roles in other public health emergencies, including spraying millions of acres in louisiana and texas for mosquito abatement after hurricane katrina. i believe they could play that same role now. they are ready to do it, but frankly they need an upgrade in their equipment to be able to do it. as radm stephen redd of the cdc told me in the homeland security and governmental affairs committee, ``there could be a role for that airwing in locations that do not have [finely honed mosquito control enterprises].'' he said that a lot of counties in this country do not have that. he said: ``one of the things that we think is really important that the zika virus outbreak is pointing out is the need to really revitalize those mosquito control efforts.'' i couldn't agree with him more. we need to revitalize these efforts to be sure we have them and use the tools that are at our disposal right now. if zika were to spread around the country, it is incredibly important that we have this control effort. i hope we move forward on this in the next couple of days, send this legislation to the president for his signature, and get moving on dealing with the zika emergency we have before us. people all over ohio ask me about it because they are worried. we need to keep our constituents safe, and we need to give them peace of mind. adopting the amendment i think we are going to have before us in the next couple of days is the best action we can take right now to achieve these goals, and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to strongly support emergency funding for this purpose. thank you. i yield back my time. the presiding officer (mr. coats). the senator from vermont. mr. leahy. mr. president, it has been 5 weeks since the senate last confirmed a judicial nominee. in that time, judicial vacancies have continued to increase. unfortunately, the republican leadership has repeatedly objected to unanimous consent motions made to overcome the obstruction of 20 judicial nominees. these are nominees who were voted out unanimously by committee and are awaiting a confirmation vote. the majority leader claims that president obama's nominees have been treated fairly, but anyone paying attention to the senate over the past 7 years knows that is not the case. it has been almost 2 months since chief judge merrick garland was nominated by president obama to fill a vacancy on the supreme court. chief judge garland is widely respected, and prior to his nomination, he had repeatedly received praise from the very republicans who now refuse to allow him to appear for a confirmation hearing. these same republicans refuse to do their jobs as senators while outside groups pour millions of dollars into television ads that seek to discredit chief judge garland's record. before there was even a supreme court nominee, one republican aide promised conservatives were ``going to light this person up.'' sadly, it appears they are making good on their threat while simultaneously refusing to allow him a public hearing where he could respond. meanwhile, lower court nominees have stalled. paula xinis, whom we will vote on today, was nominated more than a year ago to fill an emergency vacancy--not just a regular vacancy but an emergency vacancy in maryland. since 2011, she has practiced as a criminal defense attorney at a law firm. prior to that, she served in the federal public defender's office for the district of maryland for 13 years, from 1998 to 2011. ms. xinis has extensive trial experience, representing hundreds of clients as a public defender and trying 16 cases to completion over the course of her career. the aba standing committee on the federal judiciary unanimously rated ms. xinis ``well qualified'' to serve in the district court. they gave paula xinis their highest rating. she is strongly supported by both senators from maryland, and her nomination was unanimously approved by the judiciary [[page s2807]] committee by voice vote 8 months ago. all the republicans on the judiciary committee approved her nomination from the committee by unanimous voice vote. senator sessions came to the floor today to oppose ms. xinis's nomination based on her experience as an examiner of complaints against police officers in the district of columbia. from 1995 to 2011, ms. xinis served as a complaint examiner in six cases where she made determinations on complaints brought against metropolitan police department officers. at her senate judiciary committee hearing, senator sessions questioned ms. xinis about her experience and expressed concern that, in the six cases ms. xinis served as a complaint examiner, she sustained rulings against police officers in all of them. senator sessions questions ms. xinis's fairness to police officers based on her determinations in these six cases. however, as senator sessions said on the floor today, he does not question her personal qualifications or her integrity to be a federal judge. and he also did not question her testimony before the judiciary committee in which she committed to being a fair and impartial judge, should she be confirmed. furthermore, ms. xinis's record as a complaint examiner shows that each one of her six determinations was sustained by the chief of police; none of them was overturned. her decisions could have been appealed and overturned if they were incorrect, but they were not. paula xinis has earned the express support of law enforcement and has defended police officers as an attorney on a number of occasions. for instance, in one case, she provided legal counsel to a baltimore police officer unfairly accused of criminal wrongdoing. that officer wrote a letter of support for ms. xinis, where he said: ``throughout the entire ordeal, i spent countless hours with paula and her team. they worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she `had my back' and that she was dedicated to seeing that i was vindicated. thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all of the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year.'' this does not sound like a person who holds any biases against law enforcement. in addition to this officer, several other members of the law enforcement community have written in support of ms. xinis's nomination. after we actually vote on paula xinis's nomination today, there will still be 19 judicial nominees pending on the executive calendar waiting for a confirmation vote. every single one of these nominees was voted out of the judiciary committee by unanimous voice vote. instead of allowing a vote on these nominees on a regular basis, the republican leadership objects to the senate being able to do our jobs. after today's vote, the next in line for consideration is a district court nominee from new jersey and then a district court nominee from nebraska. i know the senators from new jersey are pushing for a vote on the nominee to serve in their state. i hope the republican senators from nebraska are urging their leadership to schedule the confirmation of robert rossiter, who was approved by unanimous voice vote in committee. that vacancy has been pending for over a year and a half. there is no good reason for votes on these nominees to be further delayed. senator grassley has indicated that republicans will shut down the judicial nominations process in july, even though vacancies have risen from 43 to 81 since republicans took over the majority. they have allowed vacancies to rise dramatically and now want to shut it down even though the judicial nominees pending are not controversial and we have numerous vacancies that need to be filled. this is wrong. contrast this to the last 2 years of george w. bush's administration, when democrats were in control. at this same point in the bush presidency, democrats had reduced vacancies to just 46. because of republican obstruction, our independent judiciary is struggling to perform its role under the constitution. the marshall project recently interviewed several sitting judges to examine the impact judicial vacancies are having on our courts. chief judge ron clark of the eastern district of texas, which currently has three judicial emergency vacancies, said: ``we're managing the best we can-- but if they don't get us another judge soon, you could start to see some more draconian kinds of delays.'' there is a nominee to this court pending in the judiciary committee, but the texas senators, who both are members of the committee, have not returned their blue slips to allow that nominee to even receive a hearing. i hope the texas senators heed the call of chief judge clark and get moving on their nominee. and i hope the senate majority allows this body to return to regular order when it comes to processing judicial nominees. we have a constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on the president's nominees. the constitution has not changed, but once president obama took office, this body's normal practice for treating nominees turned for the worse. deference to home state senators was no longer the norm, and procedural delay after procedural delay quickly became the standard practice of the republican caucus, whether they were in the minority or now in the majority. in a new york times op-ed a week ago, former judge shira sheindlin of the southern district of new york warned that the republicans' obstruction to district court nominees ``undermines public trust in the impartiality and legitimacy of the judiciary.'' i was heartened to hear the majority leader last week make the point that an election year is ``not an excuse not to do our work.'' i could not agree more. that is why in the last 2 years of the george w. bush administration, when i served as chairman of the judiciary committee, we confirmed 68 of president bush's judicial nominees. that is compared to a handful of president obama's nominees that the republicans have allowed. we confirmed 68 of president bush's judicial nominees, and we confirmed right up to the time we went out for the elections in september, not in june or july or may. we have also confirmed more than a dozen supreme court justices in presidential election years, and many in this senate served at the time. the last one we had, of course, was during president reagan's final year in office. we did so because we knew the supreme court should not be held hostage to election-year politics; yet we are being held hostage to election-year politics because we are not doing our jobs. and the supreme court issued a couple more 4-to-4 opinions today. i urge the majority leader to heed his own advice and to schedule a confirmation vote for the pending lower court nominees, and i urge the chairman of the judiciary committee to follow suit by scheduling confirmation hearings for chief judge garland so that we can do our jobs. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that judge sheindlin's op-ed and the marshall project review be printed in the record. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: [from the marshall project, april 26, 2016] what happens when there aren't enough judges to go around? (by eli hager) the ninth seat on the supreme court has been vacant for two months. but antonin scalia's chair is not the only empty one in the vast federal judiciary, where several judgeships have remained unfilled for 30 months or more. around the country, there are 84 of these vacancies, largely as a result of the senate's historically low rate of confirming president barack obama's nominees. and since the beginning of last year, the number of unfilled seats and pending nominations have been steadily rising. down in the gears of the justice system, all those absent judges have taken a toll. because courts are obligated to find ways to meet speedy- trial rules, at least in criminal cases, the vacancies have not caused across-the-board delays. but by all accounts, the unconfirmed nominees--combined with what advocates say is an insufficient number of judgeships overall--have forced the system to find sometimes extraordinary ways to make do with the few judges available. some judges, for example, are having to drive hundreds of miles to cover the empty seats. less-qualified magistrate judges, senior judges who are supposed to be entering retirement, and visiting judges who fly in from other states, have all had to pitch in. and many of the remaining judges say that it's hard, with such a lack of personnel, to give every case the attention it deserves. in the worst-hit districts, including all four districts of texas, some areas of florida [[page s2808]] and california, middle alabama, and elsewhere, the situation is now considered an ``emergency.'' ron clark, chief judge of the eastern district of texas, which has three judicial emergencies out of only eight total judgeships, says that ``we're managing the best we can--but if they don't get us another judge soon, you could start to see some more draconian kinds of delays.'' judicial vacancies in the federal courts in the past year, unfilled federal judgeships have been rising dramatically. similarly, the number of seats on the bench considered ``emergencies''--vacant for many months with a large caseload per judge--and the number of white house nominations awaiting senate confirmation have climbed. a 2014 study by the brennan center for justice found that the vacancies led to a host of negative consequences. among them were unresolved motions, habeas corpuspetitions waiting years to be heard (or being handled by law clerks instead of judges), judges spending less time on each case, and defendants pleading guilty because they believed a trial would not get the timely attention it deserved. and in civil proceedings, where the speedy trial act does not apply, longer wait times for trial are becoming more common. morrison c. england jr., chief judge of the eastern district of california, says that ``cases that aren't the priority are going to get pushed back for years, literally.'' in middle alabama, ricky martin, a pastor, had been allowing registered sex-offenders to stay in mobile homes surrounding his church--until the state legislature made it illegal for him to do so. martin filed suit in august of 2014, and the local d.a. responded with a ``motion to dismiss'' a few months later. but a judge didn't get around to weighing in--in martin's favor--until this april, and the case may not actually be resolved for two more years or longer. the process would have taken only three to four months if there were more judges available, says randall marshall, legal director of the aclu of alabama. but sometimes, the effect is the opposite: the proceedings get rushed. brian mcgiverin, a civil-rights lawyer in austin, texas, says that because there are so few judges, the remaining ones are all overbooked. as a result, they often ``give you a cramped amount of time for trial, regardless of how many witnesses you'd like to call.'' mcgiverin recently assisted in the case of a woman named abieyuwa ikhinmwin, who claimed that she was racially profiled, handled with excessive force, and wrongfully arrested by police in san antonio. he says the court tried to ``fast-track'' her lawsuit, threatening to dismiss it within 21 days unless she paid a fee and submitted additional information--which would not have happened when there were enough judges. clark, chief judge in the nearby eastern district of texas, says that ``with so few of us, it's definitely harder to have the flexibility that a defense lawyer might want us to. so the answer sometimes has to be, `no, sorry, we can't offer that time in court.' '' meanwhile, the consequences of too few judges are worsened in the most geographically expansive districts. ``when there's a missing judge in a state like ours,'' clark says, ``it's not like we can walk down the hall and take care of a trial for him--the trip from beaumont to plano is five and a half hours, and that's if the traffic is good.'' he and the other judges in his district waste about two days a week on the road. ``we're one traffic accident away from the wheels falling off,'' he says. as an additional stop-gap measure, the worst-hit districts are relying on pinch hitters. in middle alabama, less-experienced magistrate judges (who are appointed directly by the district judges, rather than nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate) have for several years been doing work once reserved for the district judges, from taking guilty pleas to overseeing evidentiary hearings. the district is also getting last- minute help from visiting judges, who have traveled from iowa and florida to pitch in. ``when there are judges who come in from elsewhere,'' says christine freeman, executive director of the federal defender's office in montgomery, ala., ``they are strangers to us, to the prosecutor, to court officials, to the probation officers, to every single person involved in a case.'' ``that makes it very hard to predict outcomes for your client,'' freeman adds. but the lack of judges has perhaps fallen hardest on senior judges, who, because they are typically over 70 or 80 years old, usually take on 50 percent or less of a full caseload. instead, in middle alabama and elsewhere, their caseloads have been 150 or even 200 percent of normal. ``i'm 73, and i'd like to be able to say, `look, i'm done, i want to spend more time with my family,' '' says michael schneider, one of the senior judges in eastern texas. ``i'm encouraged that the president has nominated someone, but i can't actually cut back until a nominee is approved.'' ``i'm going to be at this for awhile,'' schneider adds. ``it's frustrating.'' england, the chief judge in eastern california, says that senior judges are the only reason why vacancies haven't become more of a crisis. ``we are living and dying with our senior judges,'' england says. ``they're taking on cases they shouldn't have to, but that's what's saving us.'' of course, federal courts being overburdened is the symptom of more than simply a lack of nominations and confirmations. since 1990, congress has not passed major legislation creating new judgeships, even as the war on drugs, and now the surge in prosecution of undocumented immigrants, have jammed up the system with exponentially more cases. as a result, by 2013, there was a 39 percent uptick in the number of overall filings, while only 4 percent more judges were added to handle all that extra work. throw in the higher-than-normal number of vacancies, and it's a recipe for an overburdened judiciary. after a three- year wait, for instance, the eastern district of california finally got a vacancy filled last october. but chief judge england says the crushing burden of too few judges hasn't lessened. ``one way or the other, congress would need to give this district more judges,'' he says. ``we need help--we have too many trials. i'm booked for 2016 and 2017 already.'' ____ [from the new york times, may 6, 2016] america's trial court judges: our front line for justice (by shira a. scheindlin) the outcry over the senate's failure to hold hearings on judge merrick garland's nomination to the supreme court is fully justified. but that isn't the only judiciary scandal on capitol hill. even as the spotlight shines on the high court, the senate has refused to confirm dozens of uncontroversial nominees to fill vacancies in the federal trial courts. such obstructionism has become an everyday occurrence. just last week, senate republicans refused to vote on 11 federal district court nominees whom the judiciary committee had already approved--even those who were supported by republicans in their home states. during president george w. bush's last two years in office, the democratic-controlled senate confirmed about 57 district court judges. since republicans took power in 2014, the senate has confirmed only 15 of president obama's trial court nominees. this is an even bigger problem than judge garland's stalled nomination. trial court judges do the bulk of the work in the federal court system: last year nearly 375,000 new cases were filed, while the supreme court justices issued just under 75 opinions. and because most trial court decisions are never appealed, they become the final word in significant disputes that affect millions of americans. i know this firsthand. i served as a trial judge for over 21 years, and stepped down from the bench last week. as i walked out of a federal courthouse in lower manhattan on one of my last days, an african-american united states marshal asked me if he could have a word. he explained that he had grown up in new york city's public housing, and thanked me for my 2013 decision in the ``stop and frisk'' case. (i ruled that the new york police department's practice in which police officers stopped hundreds of thousands of new yorkers without reasonable suspicion, a vast majority of whom were innocent african- americans and latinos, was unconstitutional.) ``you just can't know what a difference this has made to so many people in my community,'' he said. ``you can't even imagine.'' but i think i can. at the policy's peak in 2011, officers stopped nearly 700,000 people. that number dropped to about 23,000 last year, and the policy change was not accompanied by a rise in serious crime, despite dire predictions to the contrary. as a result of my rulings and community outcry, the police department agreed to reforms, which include better record keeping, the use of police body cameras and the abandonment of racial profiling. other examples abound. in 1974, judge jack weinstein of the eastern district of new york found the de facto segregation in a coney island public school to be unconstitutional, a ruling affirmed on appeal. the school was ultimately integrated under his supervision, and without the ``white flight'' that politicians had feared would result. and in one of the highest-profile civil rights cases ever in a trial court, leonard about a decade later that both the housing and schools in yonkers were intentionally segregated, and ordered construction of integrated housing in the city. an appeals court upheld this ruling, which, despite years of public protest, immensely improved the living conditions for thousands of yonkers residents. the influence of district judges has likewise had an effect on national security. in the mid-2000s, judge alvin hellerstein, also from the southern district of new york, ordered the government to disclose photographs under the freedom of information act that depict the abuse of abu ghraib detainees, which was affirmed by the appellate court. judge hellerstein also effectively forced the government to turn over the department of justice's infamous ``torture memos,'' which incited a national conversation about whether torture is ever appropriate. not every decision by district court judges benefits the public: last week judge thomas schroeder of north carolina's middle district upheld myriad legislative changes to the state's voting rules that will result in reduced voting opportunities for minorities, unless reversed. [[page s2809]] whether judge garland should be confirmed or not, there can be no denying that supreme court nominations are inherently political. so it's no surprise that they are drawn out for ideological or partisan reasons. but district court nominations are different. ideology is not the issue: experience and competence are the only criteria. and yet the senate majority's policy of delaying qualified district-court nominations on purely political grounds undermines public trust in the impartiality and legitimacy of the judiciary. this is especially worrisome because the public's understanding of how justice is administered is most likely based on its access to and experience with lower court proceedings. presidential debates have focused on the islamic state, trade pacts and immigration policy; meanwhile, the next president will most likely appoint 130 trial judges over the next four years. the public needs to know what's at stake. trial judges must spot the issues, decide the outcomes and fashion the remedies in all kinds of disputes. i cannot force this congress to do its job. but i urge voters not to forget the white house's power to appoint all judges when they choose the next president. mr. leahy. thank you, mr. president. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from maryland. ms. mikulski. thank you very much, mr. president. i rise this evening in support of the nomination of paula xinis to serve on the district court of maryland. i know senator cardin will be coming to the floor shortly to also comment on ms. xinis's nomination. senator cardin and i recommended ms. xinis to president obama with the utmost confidence in her abilities, talent, and competence for the job. she is a brilliant litigator and a dedicated public servant. the judiciary committee agreed with us, because they also voted her out of the committee unanimously. i thank senator mcconnell, the majority leader, for scheduling this vote; senator grassley for moving this nomination; and i also thank my very good and dear friend senator leahy, the vice chairman of the committee, who has been a strong advocate not only for this nomination but for moving all nominations forward, as voted out by the committee in a prompt way. as i talk about ms. xinis, i want the presiding officer to know that i have recommended several judicial nominees for district and appellate courts, and i take my advise and consent responsibility very seriously. when i recommend to the president a position on the district court, i have four criteria: absolute integrity, judicial competence and temperament, a commitment to core constitutional principles, and a history of civic engagement in maryland. ms. xinis exceeds these expectations over and beyond. she has dedicated her career to the rule of law, achieving equal justice under the law and also being an advocate for the underdog. she is truly an outstanding nominee with a long history of public service--14 years as a federal public defender, handling everything from the most simple misdemeanors to very complex white-collar crimes. she has also taken on extra duties, training staff and being an attorney supervisor of research and writing, proving time and time again how committed and dedicated she is. she worked as a clerk for the distinguished and esteemed judge diana gribbon motz, a well-respected judge on the fourth circuit. she also has been a member of the private sector as a senior trial partner in a private law firm in baltimore, taking on complex civil litigation and protecting those who have been harmed by lead paint or carbon monoxide poisoning. judge motz, in recommending ms. xinis to me, said she is so intelligent and generous in terms of working very hard, in terms of knowing the law and practicing the law, but she also commented on her work ethic, praising her skill in the courtroom and her service to the community. she has mentored children, provided legal advice to at-need communities in baltimore, and served on numerous bar associations. she has deep appreciation for the law and everything that it means. i do believe she will be an outstanding judge. there have been criticisms raised of ms. xinis, and the criticisms have centered around her support within the law enforcement community. flashing yellow lights were raised by one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, asking whether she had an impartial attitude toward police officers. i have four letters here from retired police officers in baltimore city all attesting to that. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the record. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: city of charlottesville, police department, charlottesville, va, august 30, 2015. re letter in support of paula xinis, for the position of united states district judge for the district of maryland. hon. charles grassley, chairman, u.s. senate committee on the judiciary, washington, dc. hon. patrick leahy, ranking member, u.s. senate committee on the judiciary, washington, dc. dear honorable senators grassley and leahy: my name is timothy longo and i currently serve as the chief of police in the city of charlottesville, virginia. i am a career law enforcement officer having previously served as a colonel with the baltimore city police department, retiring in march of 2000. in addition, to my professional training and experience, i am proud to have received my law degree from the university of baltimore and was admitted to the maryland bar in december of 1993. for the past 25 years, i have had the honor of instructing thousands of law enforcement officers and administrators on matters of policy, law, and generally accepted policing practices. in addition to my sworn duties and responsibilities, i have served on many occasions as a police practices expert assisting both plaintiff and defense counsel in civil rights claims resulting from the actions of law enforcement officers, and the policies and practices related to those actions. it is in this capacity that i have come to know and respect paula xinis. i have come to learn that the senate judiciary committee is presently considering paula's candidacy and i respectfully write in support of her appointment. paula and i met several years ago when i was asked to assist her in the evaluation of a civil rights claim that she had filed on behalf of a client related to the actions of a municipal law enforcement officer and the agency and municipality that employed that officer. the claim arose out of a use of force incident which resulted in serious and permanent injury. i firmly believe that cases such as this requires not only a thorough understanding of section 1983 litigation and that of municipal liability, but an equally thorough understanding of police training, policy, and practice. for more than a year, i worked closely with paula as she sought to better understand how a police officer is trained, the policies, principles, and practices that guide their work, as well as the manner in which police departments investigate incidents that result in force. what i discovered from the onset, and frankly what continued to impress me as i worked with paula on this important matter, is the thoughtful and objective manner in which she approached both the facts and the theory of her client's case. although the complaint she had advanced on behalf of her client depicted a series of facts that one may find was clearly contrary to generally accepted policing practices on the face of her client's complaint, she consistently endeavored to examine that complaint and the facts in the support of it through the lenses of a career law enforcement officer who had not only worked the streets of a large metropolitan city, instructed thousands in policing, but also served as a policy maker as to the training of police officers and practices that guide that work. she and i spoke countless times, and at great length, about not only that particular case but the way that police officers go about their work and the decisions that they make quickly and oftentimes without much deliberation. paula was amazingly careful to reserve her own judgment and opinion as to the appropriateness of the officer's conduct and that of the agency's policy maker and listened carefully to my assessment of her claim and my opinion as to its propriety in light of my specialized training and experience. america's law enforcement officers are facing incredibly difficult challenges as we closely evaluate the manner in which we go about our work, carefully consider re-shaping and reforming our practices, and endeavor to strengthen the necessary relationships we have with those whom we serve. undoubtedly, law enforcement officers, policy makers, and municipalities will more frequently find themselves being scrutinized by our trial and appellate courts, and ultimately the court of public opinion. the nature of our work and recent police-citizen interactions that have ended tragically makes this reality most certain. thus, it has never been more critical to connect the right people to this important work; not just on the front line but throughout the criminal justice continuum. it is with a tremendous amount of pride and the utmost confidence that i respectfully ask the senate of the united states to confirm the appointment of paula xinis to the united states district court for the district of maryland. i have absolutely no doubt that paula will bring the competence and objectivity that is necessary to discharge the [[page s2810]] duties of such an important position. she has my confidence, respect, and unfettered support. if i can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to call upon me. meanwhile, i thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration. respectfully submitted, timothy john longo, sr., chief of police, city of charlottesville, virginia. ____ police department, baltimore, maryland, 4 september 2015. to: senator patrick leahy. from: sgt

support of judicial nomination of paula xinis for the united states district court for the district of maryland. hon. charles grassley, chairman, u.s. senate committee on the judiciary, washington, dc. hon. patrick leahy, ranking member, u.s. senate committee on the judiciary, washington, dc. dear senators grassley and leahy: please accept this letter as support for the nomination of paula xinis as a united states district judge for the district of maryland. i was employed as a police officer with the baltimore police department from 1987 until the time of my retirement in september 2014. while assigned to the patrol division, i handled calls for service related to violations of maryland's handgun and narcotics laws. i also actively participated in shooting investigations. i also spent thirteen years assigned to the tactical unit/quick response team. during my tenure with the tactical unit, one of the unit's primary focus was serving high risk warrants for the homicide and robbery units. when we weren't training, serving warrants and/or responding to barricade/hostage situations, we were utilized as suppression unit for illegal handguns and narcotics violations. for five straight years, my partner and i maintained the highest number of gun seizures/arrests and the largest narcotics cases within the baltimore city police tactical section. we received numerous commendations for our handgun arrests. throughout the course of my career, i was called upon to testify in both the district and circuit courts in baltimore city and county, as well as the united states district court for the district of maryland in baltimore. unfortunately, my successful career in law enforcement was derailed in 2014 when i encountered difficulties in connection with a call for service. i was improperly and unfairly accuse of wrongdoing which led to criminal charges. this was a new experience for me as i had never even been disciplined during my career. i felt vulnerable and betrayed. it was clear to me and my wife that we needed legal representation that would aggressively fight to vindicate me. my wife, whose practice is primarily the defense of civil cases, had been involved in a case in baltimore city where ms. xinis represented the plaintiffs several years prior. during the course of that case, she would often remark that ms. xinis was a worthy advocate, yet fair and open-minded. because of her experience with ms. xinis, my wife contacted her on a weekend to seek legal counsel and advice. from that point forward, ms. xinis made herself available to us, even if it was to simply reassure us that we were in good hands. throughout the entire ordeal, i spent countless hours with paula and her team. they worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she ``had my back'' and that she was dedicated to seeing that i was vindicated. thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all of the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year. i can personally attest to ms. xinis' legal acumen and her commitment to seeking justice, regardless of who the defendant may be. i observed her demonstrate the ability to forcefully argue her position to the court while being respectful to the court and other counsel. she can be a fierce advocate while maintaining a reassuring demeanor. my exposure to the judicial process throughout the course of my law enforcement career and as an officer who was wrongfully accused, has provided me with insight as to what is required to be an effective, fair and open-minded jurist. i can state without a doubt that ms. xinis possesses all of the necessary traits to be an asset to the federal bench in maryland. the committee could not find a more qualified candidate to fill the vacancy in maryland. sincerely, thomas j. schmidt, sr. ____ september 1, 2015. re support of paula xinis, for united states district judge for the district of maryland. dear senator patrick leahy (ranking member) united states senate committee on the judiciary: my name is gregory eads, jr. i am a retired baltimore city police officer. i served 22 years on the baltimore city police department and retired in november 2014. i was currently assigned to the bomb squad and emergency services unit where primarily i responded to suspicious package calls, bomb sweeps for visiting v.i.p's and stadium events. in my tenure as a police officer with the department i've acquired several skills and with worked in numerous specialized units. i have worked in patrol, bike(flex) squad, drug enforcement unit, swat, organized crime unit, firearms apprehension strike team. i am highly decorated officer that was awarded several unit citations, accommodations, and bronze star for valor. i've come to learn the senate judiciary committee is considering paula for a united states district judge. i want to extend my support for paula as a candidate. paula and i met at her law firm as she was preparing to defend a co- worker in criminal case. she was interviewing me as a character witness. during this exchange we discussed my family, experiences and my background being a second generation police officer in baltimore city. we share some similarities on life and making a difference in the world. paula has a young child, demanding career and is very well known among her peers. i was most impressed with her attention to detail, due diligence and preparation of the case. she is hardworking, open minded, and fair. i believe she would be an asset as she exemplifies the firm qualities that a united states district court judge possesses. as a police officer we need judges that are fair, impartial and firm on the bench. with paula being confirmed by the senate committee you will have that judge i am referring to. i am grateful that i had the pleasure of meeting and working with paula. sincerely, gregory eads jr., (retired) bpd. ms. mikulski. one letter is from someone who is a 20-year veteran, working in the western district. the western district is where they filmed ``the wire.'' it is rough, tough, and hardscrabble. this former police sergeant said: in closing, as a 20-year member of the law enforcement community, i know firsthand the need to have judges that are well balanced, fair and great listeners. . . . that is why i proudly recommend ms. paula xinis to the position of u.s. district judge. i won't go through every letter--the record will speak for itself-- but when you have retired police officers, those who are not on duty now but who worked with her hands-on and who know the way she works with law enforcement, the way she engages with them when she was a public defender and so on--i think these letters speak for themselves. in closing, let me say this: the job of a u.s. senator to recommend someone to be a judge is indeed a great honor, but it is an enormous responsibility. i take it very seriously, and i would only recommend somebody who was truly qualified to render impartial justice and bring the competency and the temperament to do that. i believe ms. xinis possesses competency, the judicial temperament, and a real commitment to equal justice under the law. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from maryland. [[page s2811]] mr. cardin. mr. president, i join senator mikulski, as the two senators from maryland, in strongly recommending the favorable consideration of paula xinis for the district court judgeship of maryland. i first want to acknowledge the leadership of our senior senator from maryland in developing a process in which we screen the very most talented people for opportunities to serve on our federal bench. this is a professional process that we have gone forward with under senator mikulski's leadership in order to try to get the very best on our courts. it is not a partisan issue at all. it is strictly looking for those who have the judicial temperament and experience to be able to be an outstanding member of the bench. we have done that on previous nominations that have been considered on this floor, and paula xinis follows in that tradition. i thank senator mikulski for the process that we went forward on in making this recommendation to president obama. i might tell you, president obama then forwarded the nomination to the senate in march of last year--in march of 2015. it took 6 months for the judiciary committee to make its recommendations to the full floor in september of 2015. it was not a controversial nomination in the committee. the committee reviewed all of ms. xinis's background, record, everything that she has done, and on a very strong voice vote brought her forward to the full floor. so this is not a controversial nomination. because of the delay, originally to fill the vacancy of deborah chasanow, who took senior status, it is now a judicial emergency. people of maryland are in a desperate situation to have an adequate number of judges to handle the workload in our district. it is critical we move forward in the confirmation of this nominee. senator mikulski has pointed out how qualified this person is. i can tell you, over the last several months, i have been stopped on numerous occasions by attorneys and nonattorneys in maryland saying: why isn't paula xinis confirmed by now? she is a wonderful person. we have had experience with her. i have heard glowing comments about her dedication to our community, her professional competency, and her qualifications to serve on the u.s. district court. it is for that reason the aba gave her the highest ratings in their review of her qualifications. she has been in the private practice of law at murphy, falcon & murphy. after just 2 years, she was made a partner in that firm. she has been an assistant federal public defender, showing her compassion to represent some of the most difficult cases in our criminal justice system. she was a law clerk for judge motz on the fourth circuit court of appeals. she has devoted her life to understanding our legal system but also to carrying out its major charge to make sure we have equal access to justice under the law. she got her jd from yale law school, her ba from the university of virginia. what i really appreciated, in getting to know paula xinis better during this confirmation process, was getting to know her family background; that is, to represent the american story. her father was an immigrant from greece, came over with very little resources. they were able to take advantage of the opportunities in this country as an immigrant family. now paula xinis has been nominated by president obama to serve on the district court for maryland. quite a success story, but paula xinis has never forgotten her background. she has always been giving back to our community. she is known for her pro bono work for her church members in the church she belongs to, but as senator mikulski pointed out, in working with the house of ruth in a mentoring program, she has taken on some of the most difficult challenges to affect the lives of people who are less fortunate. she has an 11-year-old who is like her second son whom she has mentored and given a real opportunity in our community. she has the whole package. she will make a great district judge. senator mikulski mentioned the comments that were made on the floor in regard to her support for law enforcement for police officers. i hope, if anyone has any questions about that, read the letters senator mikulski put into the record. i know of some of these cases. i know of the case of timothy john longo, who served with the baltimore city police department and is now the chief of police for charlottesville, va. he said: i have absolutely no doubt that paula will bring the competency and objectivity that is necessary to discharge the duty of such an important position. she has my confidence, respect and unfettered support. then there is thomas schmidt, who ms. xinis represented when he was accused of wrongdoing as a police officer. she represented him in the most difficult challenge. mr. schmidt said: throughout the entire ordeal, i spent countless hours with paula and her team. they worked diligently seeking the evidence needed to exonerate me. although it was an extremely dark time for me, she always made me feel confident that she had my back, and that she was dedicated to seeing that i was vindicated. thankfully, as a result of her tireless efforts on my behalf, all the charges brought against me were dismissed earlier this year. she has been in the forefront of defending those who were defending us as first responders. there are other letters that have been written by police officers indicating that paula xinis contains exactly what they want to see in a judge: someone who is fair and impartial and who will carry out the rule of law in an objective manner. so for all of those reasons, we bring you a nominee who is eminently qualified and deserves the support of this body. we would urge our colleagues to support this nomination. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from iowa. mr. grassley. today the senate will vote on the nomination of paula xinis to be a judge for the district of maryland. i will support that nomination. mr. president, i come to the floor at this time to also talk about judges generally. i have been hearing the usual complaints from members of the minority party regarding the pace of judicial nominations. i would urge my colleagues to step back and look at the bigger picture. the relevant number to consider is the number of confirmations during an entire presidency. at this point in his presidency, president george w. bush had 303 judicial nominees confirmed. after tonight's vote, so far in his presidency, president obama will have 325 confirmed. those are 22 more nominees than bush had. so as we continue to hear complaints about how many judges are being confirmed, we should put these complaints in context. the simple fact is, president obama has had quite a few more nominees confirmed than president bush did. further, i would note that as chairman, after this wednesday, i will have held hearings for the same number of nominees this congress has had as the last chairman of the committee did to this point during the last 2 years of president bush's presidency. at this point in the 2008 congress--that would be the 110th congress--the former chairman held hearings on 43 nominees. at the end of may of this year, we will have held hearings on 43 nominees thus far in the 114th congress. i yield back all remaining time. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. all time is yielded back. the question is, will the senate advise and consent to the xinis nomination? mr. grassley. mr. president, i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second? there appears to be a sufficient second. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk called the roll. mr. cornyn. the following senators are necessarily absent: the senator from arkansas (mr. cotton), the senator from texas (mr. cruz), the senator from wyoming (mr. enzi), the senator from arizona (mr. flake), the senator from wisconsin (mr. johnson), the senator from kansas (mr. moran), the senator from kansas (mr. roberts), the senator from alaska (mr. sullivan), the senator from pennsylvania (mr. toomey), and the senator from louisiana (mr. vitter). mr. durbin. i announce that the senator from maine (mr. king), the senator from vermont (mr. sanders), [[page s2812]] and the senator from oregon (mr. wyden) are necessarily absent. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). are there any other senators in the chamber desiring to vote? the result was announced--yeas 53, nays 34, as follows: [rollcall

CREC-2016-05-16-pt1-PgS2812-2,CREC-2016-05-16,114,INCOME INEQUALITY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2812-S2814] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INCOME INEQUALITY Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a newspaper article at the conclusion of my remarks. Income inequality has been a hot topic this campaign season. It has become the rallying cry of the left to support their economic agenda. Whether it is taxing the rich, raising the minimum wage, combating global warming, or any other number of policies. If you listen to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders on the campaign trail, you would get the impression that income inequality is the fault of Republicans. They contend that their preferred policies will close the gap between the rich and the poor. However, the inconvenient fact is that inequality rose considerably more under President Clinton than it did under President Reagan. Further, it has increased more under President Obama than it did under President Bush. For any of my colleagues wondering how this could be the case, I would encourage them to read Lawrence Lindsey's op-ed that ran in the Wall Street Journal in March. Mr. Lindsey's article title ``How Progressives Drive Income Inequality'' details how liberal policies have not only failed to reduce income inequality, but may in fact be contributing to it. For instance, my colleagues on the left all too frequently look to ever richer and more expansive transfer payment programs as the solution. However, too often our existing transfer programs meant to help the less fortunate act as an anchor preventing Americans from climbing up the income ladder. This risks creating a permanent underclass of citizens that are dependent on the state for their basic needs. That may be the dream of European- style Social Democrats, but it is most certainly not the American Dream. The Congressional Budget Office looks at this effect in terms of marginal effective tax rates on low and moderate income workers. This refers to how much extra tax or reduction in government benefits is imposed on an--American worker when he or she earns an additional dollar of income. CBO estimates that in 2016 those under 450% of the federal poverty level will face an average effective tax rate of about 41%. Keep in mind that this is just the average. CBO demonstrates how a substantial number of workers could experience marginal effective rates exceeding 50, 60, or even 80%, which is far higher than the top statutory rate of 39.6% paid by the wealthiest Americans. The end result is a worker facing these rates may just decide it doesn't make much sense to take on extra hours or put in the effort to learn extra skills to increase their earnings potential. Historically, this has impacted married women in the workforce most of all as they are more likely than men to drop out of the workforce completely as a result. Discouraging individuals from entering the labor force, taking on more work hours, gaining extra experience, or learning new skills, is a recipe for stagnate incomes and increased income disparity. But, far from seeking to address these work disincentive effects, President Obama has made it worse for millions of workers. Take the premium tax credit enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act for instance. CBO estimates it will raise marginal tax rates by an estimated 12 percentage points for recipients. Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders also have provided no indication they would reverse this trend. In fact, they appear to only be interested in exacerbating this problem through richer transfer programs, increased costs on employers, and increased payroll taxes. The scapegoat of the income inequality debate on the left has, of course, been the much-hyped top 1 percent. Here we are told that if we just tax the rich, we can solve all of our problems and address income inequality in one fell swoop. But, if increased taxes on the wealthy is a solution to income inequality, why--as I pointed out at the start of this speech--did income inequality grow faster under President Clinton than under President Reagan? And why has income inequality grown faster under President Obama than under President Bush? The fact of the matter is that taxing the wealthy to reduce income inequality at best is a fool's errand and at worst could be a blow to our economy--potentially harming individuals at all income levels. A recent research paper by the liberal Brookings Institution looked directly into the question of whether substantially increasing taxes on the wealthy would reduce income inequality. To quote their findings, ``An increase in the top tax rate leads to an almost imperceptible reduction in overall income inequality, even if the additional revenue is explicitly redistributed.'' Raising taxes might be successful at generating revenue to fund greater wealth transfer payments. But it does nothing to rectify the ``opportunity gap.'' Soak the rich policies do not create greater opportunity for low- income individuals. In fact, wealth transfer policies often have the perverse effect of trapping their intended beneficiaries in soul- crushing government dependency. Moreover, because of their negative effects on economic growth and capital formation, they can reduce opportunity for all Americans. You do not have to take my word for the anti-growth effects of increasing taxes. Research by Christina Romer, President Obama's former chief economist, found that a tax increase of 1% of GDP reduces economic growth by as much as 3%. According to this study, tax increases have such a substantial effect on economic growth because of the ``powerful negative effect of tax increases on investment.'' In effect, what those who pursue wealth-destroying redistributionist policies are really saying--to quote Margaret Thatcher--is that they ``would rather that the poor were poorer, provided that the rich were less rich.'' That may result in less differences in wealth between Americans, but the expense of making us all worse off. Our goal must be to create wealth and opportunity for ALL Americans. We should reject the notion that in order to improve the lot of one individual, someone else must be made worse off. The leadership of other side has become fixated on redistributing the existing economic pie. The better policy is to increase the size of the pie. When this occurs, no one is made better off at the expense of anyone else. [[Page S2813]] This is best achieved through pro-growth policies aimed at growing the economic pie, not by taking from some and giving to others. Instead of seeking to reduce inequality by knocking the top down a few pegs on the income ladder, policies should be focused on helping individuals climb upwards by tearing down barriers that stand in their way. We all agree with the need for a sound safety net to protect the most vulnerable among us. But when that safety net begins to act like an anchor holding people back, we need to be brave enough to chart a new course. This is what we sought to do with welfare reforms in 1994 through work requirements and incentives. It is once again time for us to review and reform programs so as to minimize as much as possible the current built-in work disincentives from transfer programs that I discussed earlier. Another often overlooked issue is the burden overregulation imposes on low-income individuals. Dr. McLaughlin of the Mercatus Center in testimony before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing earlier this year discussed two negative impacts regulation can have on low-income households. First, while it is well recognized that regulations can increase transaction costs for businesses, it is equally true that consumers feel the costs in the form of higher prices. Since low-income households tend to spend, rather than save, a much larger share of their income, they are the ones hit hardest by the regulatory costs. In this regard, regulation acts much like a regressive tax on the consumption of those that are the least well off. A second point made by Dr. McLaughlin is that regulations can often create a barrier to entry. Setting out on one's own to start a business is as American as apple pie. It is an avenue that Americans throughout history have taken to climb from the poor house to the penthouse. But, the cost imposed by entry regulations can too often stand in the way. This directly limits opportunities of lower-income individuals who are the least likely to be able to cut through the red tape and have money on hand to afford the associated costs. Research by Dr. McLaughlin directly links entry regulations with income inequality. His study looked at the relationship between regulation and income inequality across 175 countries and found that stringent entry regulations are correlated with significantly higher levels of income inequality. On the campaign trail we have heard Senator Sanders sing the virtues of Denmark in his crusade against inequality. Interestingly enough, Denmark scores very well in the World Bank's ``ease of doing business'' ranking, which looks at the cost, time, and overall red tape in starting and running a business. In fact, Denmark is ranked third, while the U.S. lags behind in seventh and has been consistently falling backwards since 2008. While Senator Sanders points to Denmark as a model for the U.S. due to its tax and social welfare policies, it is Denmark's regulatory efficiency that deserves our attention. In addition to reducing unnecessary regulatory barriers and built-in work disincentives, there is no question we need to do a better job ensuring individuals have the skills necessary to compete in the 21 century economy. There has been considerable research demonstrating that the widening wage gap between skilled and unskilled labor has contributed to the growth in income inequality. I consistently hear from employers in Iowa who cannot find enough skilled workers to fill well-paying jobs. If we are to reduce income inequality, we must first reduce opportunity inequality. We have an excellent system of community colleges in Iowa that train Iowans for jobs that are available in Iowa, but those who are chronically unemployed tend to lack the so-called ``soft skills'' that are necessary to hold down a job. In order to eliminate opportunity inequality, we must get back to the notion of the inherent dignity of work and ensure that hard work pays off. These are just a few areas we should be able to work together on to increase opportunities for those least well off among us. Increasing opportunity should be our focus, not pitting American against American based on their socioeconomic status. If we make increased opportunity our focus, no one is required to be made worse off to benefit someone else. In fact, by tearing down barriers standing in the way of hardworking Americans, all Americans will benefit from higher productivity, higher wages, and higher economic growth. My colleagues on the other side who are truly interested in reducing poverty and inequality should abandon their divisive politics of envy and class warfare Instead, work with Republicans on an agenda focused on economic growth and opportunity to benefit ALL Americans. I yield the floor. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [Mar. 4, 2016] How Progressives Drive Income Inequality (By Lawrence B. Lindsey) Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are promising all types of programs to make America a more equal country. That's no surprise. But when you look at performance and not rhetoric, the administrations of political progressives have made the distribution of income more unequal than their adversaries, who supposedly favor the wealthy. The Census Bureau releases annual updates on income distribution in the U.S., publishing three technical statistical measures--the Gini index, the mean logarithmic deviation of income (mean log deviation for short), and the Theil index--each of which represents inequality levels on a scale of 0 to 1 (zero signifies perfect equality and 1 indicates perfect inequality). By all three measures, inequality rose more under Bill Clinton than under Ronald Reagan. And it wasn't even close. While the inequality increase as measured by the Gini index was only slightly more during Clinton's two terms, the Theil index and mean log deviation increased two and three times as much, respectively. Barack Obama's administration follows this pattern, despite the complaints he and his supporters have made about his predecessor. The mean log deviation increased 37% more under Mr. Obama than under President George W. Bush, although when this statistic was released, Mr. Obama had only six years as president compared with Mr. Bush's eight. The Gini index rose more than three times as much under Mr. Obama than under Mr. Bush. The Theil index increased sharply during the Obama administration, while it fell slightly under Bush 43. Sure, no president intends to raise inequality. And the spin doctors for Messrs. Clinton and Obama may insist that it wasn't their fault. But consider their policies. Both Democratic presidents presided over bubble economies fueled by easy monetary policy. There is no better way to make the rich richer than to run policies that push up the price of financial assets. Cheap money is a boon to those who have access to it. Interest rates were also too low under Bush 43, but that bubble was in housing, and the effects were therefore more evenly distributed than under Mr. Clinton's stock-market bubble or Mr. Obama's credit bubble. Money matters, but so do other policies, such as the long, historic sweep of the expanding welfare state. In 1968, government transfer payments totaled $53 billion or roughly 7% of personal income. By 2014, these had climbed to $2.5 trillion--about 17% of personal income. Despite the redistribution of a sixth of all income, inequality measured by all three of the Census Bureau's indexes is far higher today than in 1968. Transfer payments under Mr. Obama increased by $560 billion. By contrast private-sector wages and salaries grew by $1.1 trillion. So for every $2 in extra wages, about $1 was paid out in extra transfer payments--lowering the relative reward to work. Forty-five million people received food stamps in mid-2015, an increase of 46% since the end of 2008. Similarly, 71.6 million individuals were enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, an increase of 13.3 million since October 2013. In 2008, during the deepest recession in 75 years, 13.2% of Americans lived below the government's official poverty line. The Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, but in 2014, after five years of economic expansion, 14.8% of Americans were still in poverty. The economy was better, and there were a lot more handouts, but still poverty rose. The structure of American households shows how this happened. From 2008 through 2014, the most recent year for which we have data, the number of two-earner households declined. These two-earner households have become the backbone of the American middle class. Research by the Hamilton Project and the Urban Institute show that when families with children making between $20,000 and $50,000 attempt to have a second earner go back to work, the effective tax rate on the extra earnings--including lost government benefits such as food stamps, the earned-income tax credit, and medical support payments--is between 50% and 80%. This phaseout of the ever increasing array of benefits has created a ``working-class trap'' instead of a ``poverty trap'' that is increasing inequality and keeping the income of these households lower than they might otherwise be. While the number of two-earner households declined during the first six years of the [[Page S2814]] Obama presidency, the number of single-earner households rose by 2.6 million and the number of households with no earners rose by almost five million. In other words, two thirds of the increase in the number of families under Mr. Obama was accounted for by households with no one working. This is the reason the middle class has shrunk, and the reason inequality has increased. And unless we increase the number of people wanting to work and the number of jobs through economic growth, inequality will only increase. The flip side of the progressive agenda to redistribute income to those with less is to raise taxes on the ``rich.'' The data show that it is also an ineffective way to reduce inequality. President Clinton increased the top tax rate on higher earners--yet inequality rose during his administration, and faster than under the tax-cutting Ronald Reagan. The same happened under President Obama. Tax rates went up on upper- income earners. Inequality rose too, and more than under his tax-cutting predecessor. A recent Brookings Institution study--whose authors include Peter Orszag, President Obama's director of the Office of Management and Budget--found that boosting the top tax rates even more, as Sen. Sanders suggests, would have little or no effect on inequality. The paper explored the effects of raising the highest marginal income-tax rate to 50% from 39.6%. Assuming no behavioral effects, the expected revenue was then distributed directly (and in theory costlessly) to the bottom 20% of income earners. The $95 billion in extra taxes and transfers reduced the Gini Coefficient by only 0.003. To put that in perspective, that reversed only one fifth of the increase in inequality during the Obama presidency. There was a catch. When the authors assumed that there might be a behavioral response by higher income taxpayers, inequality fell--but for the wrong reasons. Less work, saving, investing and more tax sheltering reduced the taxable income of higher earners and therefore meant less revenue to redistribute So the rich got poorer, by their own choice, but the poor got less in benefits. A true lose-lose situation. None of this should really be surprising. If the socialist ideal of ``from each according to his ability, to each according to his need'' worked in practice, the Berlin Wall might still be standing. Of course, one of the reasons it came down is that a new ruling class emerged to take from the productive and give to those in need, siphoning off a cut of the swag along the way. Ruling classes always have sticky fingers. Redistribution through the political process is not costless--even in a perfect world there would be a large bureaucracy to feed. Special-interest elites also emerge when so much money is being moved around. They take their cut, introducing even more inefficiency into the system. Presidential contenders who boast of their plans to reduce inequality might ponder the fact that providing more free things is not the answer. Even free college and free health care are paid with taxes that discourage people from increasing their work, savings and entrepreneurship. Attacking the rich and running against inequality may be a sensible political strategy. But in the end the programs to implement this strategy make the problem worse. Yet advocates come back and demand the same programs. That is perilously close to the definition of insanity attributed to Einstein: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. The repeated failure of political promises has another downside--increasing voter alienation and cynicism. The appeal of redistribution is understandable, but voters who think the progressives running today are going to reduce inequality are falling into the same trap as people entering fifth or sixth marriages--the triumph of hope over experience.

In effect, what those who pursue wealth-destroying redistributionist policies are really saying--to quote Margaret Thatcher--is that they ``would rather that the poor were poorer, provided that the rich were less rich.'' That may result in less differences in wealth between Americans, but the expense of making us all worse off. Our goal must be to create wealth and opportunity for ALL Americans. We should reject the notion that in order to improve the lot of one individual, someone else must be made worse off. The leadership of other side has become fixated on redistributing the existing economic pie. The better policy is to increase the size of the pie. When this occurs, no one is made better off at the expense of anyone else. [[Page S2813]] This is best achieved through pro-growth policies aimed at growing the economic pie, not by taking from some and giving to others. Instead of seeking to reduce inequality by knocking the top down a few pegs on the income ladder, policies should be focused on helping individuals climb upwards by tearing down barriers that stand in their way. We all agree with the need for a sound safety net to protect the most vulnerable among us. But when that safety net begins to act like an anchor holding people back, we need to be brave enough to chart a new course. This is what we sought to do with welfare reforms in 1994 through work requirements and incentives. It is once again time for us to review and reform programs so as to minimize as much as possible the current built-in work disincentives from transfer programs that I discussed earlier. Another often overlooked issue is the burden overregulation imposes on low-income individuals. Dr. McLaughlin of the Mercatus Center in testimony before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing earlier this year discussed two negative impacts regulation can have on low-income households. First, while it is well recognized that regulations can increase transaction costs for businesses, it is equally true that consumers feel the costs in the form of higher prices. Since low-income households tend to spend, rather than save, a much larger share of their income, they are the ones hit hardest by the regulatory costs. In this regard, regulation acts much like a regressive tax on the consumption of those that are the least well off. A second point made by Dr. McLaughlin is that regulations can often create a barrier to entry. Setting out on one's own to start a business is as American as apple pie. It is an avenue that Americans throughout history have taken to climb from the poor house to the penthouse. But, the cost imposed by entry regulations can too often stand in the way. This directly limits opportunities of lower-income individuals who are the least likely to be able to cut through the red tape and have money on hand to afford the associated costs. Research by Dr. McLaughlin directly links entry regulations with income inequality. His study looked at the relationship between regulation and income inequality across 175 countries and found that stringent entry regulations are correlated with significantly higher levels of income inequality. On the campaign trail we have heard Senator Sanders sing the virtues of Denmark in his crusade against inequality. Interestingly enough, Denmark scores very well in the World Bank's ``ease of doing business'' ranking, which looks at the cost, time, and overall red tape in starting and running a business. In fact, Denmark is ranked third, while the U.S. lags behind in seventh and has been consistently falling backwards since 2008. While Senator Sanders points to Denmark as a model for the U.S. due to its tax and social welfare policies, it is Denmark's regulatory efficiency that deserves our attention. In addition to reducing unnecessary regulatory barriers and built-in work disincentives, there is no question we need to do a better job ensuring individuals have the skills necessary to compete in the 21 century economy. There has been considerable research demonstrating that the widening wage gap between skilled and unskilled labor has contributed to the growth in income inequality. I consistently hear from employers in Iowa who cannot find enough skilled workers to fill well-paying jobs. If we are to reduce income inequality, we must first reduce opportunity inequality. We have an excellent system of community colleges in Iowa that train Iowans for jobs that are available in Iowa, but those who are chronically unemployed tend to lack the so-called ``soft skills'' that are necessary to hold down a job. In order to eliminate opportunity inequality, we must get back to the notion of the inherent dignity of work and ensure that hard work pays off. These are just a few areas we should be able to work together on to increase opportunities for those least well off among us. Increasing opportunity should be our focus, not pitting American against American based on their socioeconomic status. If we make increased opportunity our focus, no one is required to be made worse off to benefit someone else. In fact, by tearing down barriers standing in the way of hardworking Americans, all Americans will benefit from higher productivity, higher wages, and higher economic growth. My colleagues on the other side who are truly interested in reducing poverty and inequality should abandon their divisive politics of envy and class warfare Instead, work with Republicans on an agenda focused on economic growth and opportunity to benefit ALL Americans. I yield the floor. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [Mar. 4, 2016] How Progressives Drive Income Inequality (By Lawrence B. Lindsey) Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are promising all types of programs to make America a more equal country. That's no surprise. But when you look at performance and not rhetoric, the administrations of political progressives have made the distribution of income more unequal than their adversaries, who supposedly favor the wealthy. The Census Bureau releases annual updates on income distribution in the U.S., publishing three technical statistical measures--the Gini index, the mean logarithmic deviation of income (mean log deviation for short), and the Theil index--each of which represents inequality levels on a scale of 0 to 1 (zero signifies perfect equality and 1 indicates perfect inequality). By all three measures, inequality rose more under Bill Clinton than under Ronald Reagan. And it wasn't even close. While the inequality increase as measured by the Gini index was only slightly more during Clinton's two terms, the Theil index and mean log deviation increased two and three times as much, respectively. Barack Obama's administration follows this pattern, despite the complaints he and his supporters have made about his predecessor. The mean log deviation increased 37% more under Mr. Obama than under President George W. Bush, although when this statistic was released, Mr. Obama had only six years as president compared with Mr. Bush's eight. The Gini index rose more than three times as much under Mr. Obama than under Mr. Bush. The Theil index increased sharply during the Obama administration, while it fell slightly under Bush 43. Sure, no president intends to raise inequality. And the spin doctors for Messrs. Clinton and Obama may insist that it wasn't their fault. But consider their policies. Both Democratic presidents presided over bubble economies fueled by easy monetary policy. There is no better way to make the rich richer than to run policies that push up the price of financial assets. Cheap money is a boon to those who have access to it. Interest rates were also too low under Bush 43, but that bubble was in housing, and the effects were therefore more evenly distributed than under Mr. Clinton's stock-market bubble or Mr. Obama's credit bubble. Money matters, but so do other policies, such as the long, historic sweep of the expanding welfare state. In 1968, government transfer payments totaled $53 billion or roughly 7% of personal income. By 2014, these had climbed to $2.5 trillion--about 17% of personal income. Despite the redistribution of a sixth of all income, inequality measured by all three of the Census Bureau's indexes is far higher today than in 1968. Transfer payments under Mr. Obama increased by $560 billion. By contrast private-sector wages and salaries grew by $1.1 trillion. So for every $2 in extra wages, about $1 was paid out in extra transfer payments--lowering the relative reward to work. Forty-five million people received food stamps in mid-2015, an increase of 46% since the end of 2008. Similarly, 71.6 million individuals were enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, an increase of 13.3 million since October 2013. In 2008, during the deepest recession in 75 years, 13.2% of Americans lived below the government's official poverty line. The Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, but in 2014, after five years of economic expansion, 14.8% of Americans were still in poverty. The economy was better, and there were a lot more handouts, but still poverty rose. The structure of American households shows how this happened. From 2008 through 2014, the most recent year for which we have data, the number of two-earner households declined. These two-earner households have become the backbone of the American middle class. Research by the Hamilton Project and the Urban Institute show that when families with children making between $20,000 and $50,000 attempt to have a second earner go back to work, the effective tax rate on the extra earnings--including lost government benefits such as food stamps, the earned-income tax credit, and medical support payments--is between 50% and 80%. This phaseout of the ever increasing array of benefits has created a ``working-class trap'' instead of a ``poverty trap'' that is increasing inequality and keeping the income of these households lower than they might otherwise be. While the number of two-earner households declined during the first six years of the [[Page S2814]] Obama presidency, the number of single-earner households rose by 2.6 million and the number of households with no earners rose by almost five million. In other words, two thirds of the increase in the number of families under Mr. Obama was accounted for by households with no one working. This is the reason the middle class has shrunk, and the reason inequality has increased. And unless we increase the number of people wanting to work and the number of jobs through economic growth, inequality will only increase. The flip side of the progressive agenda to redistribute income to those with less is to raise taxes on the ``rich.'' The data show that it is also an ineffective way to reduce inequality. President Clinton increased the top tax rate on higher earners--yet inequality rose during his administration, and faster than under the tax-cutting Ronald Reagan. The same happened under President Obama. Tax rates went up on upper- income earners. Inequality rose too, and more than under his tax-cutting predecessor. A recent Brookings Institution study--whose authors include Peter Orszag, President Obama's director of the Office of Management and Budget--found that boosting the top tax rates even more, as Sen. Sanders suggests, would have little or no effect on inequality. The paper explored the effects of raising the highest marginal income-tax rate to 50% from 39.6%. Assuming no behavioral effects, the expected revenue was then distributed directly (and in theory costlessly) to the bottom 20% of income earners. The $95 billion in extra taxes and transfers reduced the Gini Coefficient by only 0.003. To put that in perspective, that reversed only one fifth of the increase in inequality during the Obama presidency. There was a catch. When the authors assumed that there might be a behavioral response by higher income taxpayers, inequality fell--but for the wrong reasons. Less work, saving, investing and more tax sheltering reduced the taxable income of higher earners and therefore meant less revenue to redistribute So the rich got poorer, by their own choice, but the poor got less in benefits. A true lose-lose situation. None of this should really be surprising. If the socialist ideal of ``from each according to his ability, to each according to his need'' worked in practice, the Berlin Wall might still be standing. Of course, one of the reasons it came down is that a new ruling class emerged to take from the productive and give to those in need, siphoning off a cut of the swag along the way. Ruling classes always have sticky fingers. Redistribution through the political process is not costless--even in a perfect world there would be a large bureaucracy to feed. Special-interest elites also emerge when so much money is being moved around. They take their cut, introducing even more inefficiency into the system. Presidential contenders who boast of their plans to reduce inequality might ponder the fact that providing more free things is not the answer. Even free college and free health care are paid with taxes that discourage people from increasing their work, savings and entrepreneurship. Attacking the rich and running against inequality may be a sensible political strategy. But in the end the programs to implement this strategy make the problem worse. Yet advocates come back and demand the same programs. That is perilously close to the definition of insanity attributed to Einstein: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. The repeated failure of political promises has another downside--increasing voter alienation and cynicism. The appeal of redistribution is understandable, but voters who think the progressives running today are going to reduce inequality are falling into the same trap as people entering fifth or sixth marriages--the triumph of hope over experience. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2812-S2814] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INCOME INEQUALITY Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a newspaper article at the conclusion of my remarks. Income inequality has been a hot topic this campaign season. It has become the rallying cry of the left to support their economic agenda. Whether it is taxing the rich, raising the minimum wage, combating global warming, or any other number of policies. If you listen to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders on the campaign trail, you would get the impression that income inequality is the fault of Republicans. They contend that their preferred policies will close the gap between the rich and the poor. However, the inconvenient fact is that inequality rose considerably more under President Clinton than it did under President Reagan. Further, it has increased more under President Obama than it did under President Bush. For any of my colleagues wondering how this could be the case, I would encourage them to read Lawrence Lindsey's op-ed that ran in the Wall Street Journal in March. Mr. Lindsey's article title ``How Progressives Drive Income Inequality'' details how liberal policies have not only failed to reduce income inequality, but may in fact be contributing to it. For instance, my colleagues on the left all too frequently look to ever richer and more expansive transfer payment programs as the solution. However, too often our existing transfer programs meant to help the less fortunate act as an anchor preventing Americans from climbing up the income ladder. This risks creating a permanent underclass of citizens that are dependent on the state for their basic needs. That may be the dream of European- style Social Democrats, but it is most certainly not the American Dream. The Congressional Budget Office looks at this effect in terms of marginal effective tax rates on low and moderate income workers. This refers to how much extra tax or reduction in government benefits is imposed on an--American worker when he or she earns an additional dollar of income. CBO estimates that in 2016 those under 450% of the federal poverty level will face an average effective tax rate of about 41%. Keep in mind that this is just the average. CBO demonstrates how a substantial number of workers could experience marginal effective rates exceeding 50, 60, or even 80%, which is far higher than the top statutory rate of 39.6% paid by the wealthiest Americans. The end result is a worker facing these rates may just decide it doesn't make much sense to take on extra hours or put in the effort to learn extra skills to increase their earnings potential. Historically, this has impacted married women in the workforce most of all as they are more likely than men to drop out of the workforce completely as a result. Discouraging individuals from entering the labor force, taking on more work hours, gaining extra experience, or learning new skills, is a recipe for stagnate incomes and increased income disparity. But, far from seeking to address these work disincentive effects, President Obama has made it worse for millions of workers. Take the premium tax credit enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act for instance. CBO estimates it will raise marginal tax rates by an estimated 12 percentage points for recipients. Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders also have provided no indication they would reverse this trend. In fact, they appear to only be interested in exacerbating this problem through richer transfer programs, increased costs on employers, and increased payroll taxes. The scapegoat of the income inequality debate on the left has, of course, been the much-hyped top 1 percent. Here we are told that if we just tax the rich, we can solve all of our problems and address income inequality in one fell swoop. But, if increased taxes on the wealthy is a solution to income inequality, why--as I pointed out at the start of this speech--did income inequality grow faster under President Clinton than under President Reagan? And why has income inequality grown faster under President Obama than under President Bush? The fact of the matter is that taxing the wealthy to reduce income inequality at best is a fool's errand and at worst could be a blow to our economy--potentially harming individuals at all income levels. A recent research paper by the liberal Brookings Institution looked directly into the question of whether substantially increasing taxes on the wealthy would reduce income inequality. To quote their findings, ``An increase in the top tax rate leads to an almost imperceptible reduction in overall income inequality, even if the additional revenue is explicitly redistributed.'' Raising taxes might be successful at generating revenue to fund greater wealth transfer payments. But it does nothing to rectify the ``opportunity gap.'' Soak the rich policies do not create greater opportunity for low- income individuals. In fact, wealth transfer policies often have the perverse effect of trapping their intended beneficiaries in soul- crushing government dependency. Moreover, because of their negative effects on economic growth and capital formation, they can reduce opportunity for all Americans. You do not have to take my word for the anti-growth effects of increasing taxes. Research by Christina Romer, President Obama's former chief economist, found that a tax increase of 1% of GDP reduces economic growth by as much as 3%. According to this study, tax increases have such a substantial effect on economic growth because of the ``powerful negative effect of tax increases on investment.'' In effect, what those who pursue wealth-destroying redistributionist policies are really saying--to quote Margaret Thatcher--is that they ``would rather that the poor were poorer, provided that the rich were less rich.'' That may result in less differences in wealth between Americans, but the expense of making us all worse off. Our goal must be to create wealth and opportunity for ALL Americans.

The Senator from Maine. ____________________",package_114_176.csv,19880,19880,19945,"[congressional record volume 162, number 77 (monday, may 16, 2016)] [senate] [pages s2812-s2814] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] income inequality mr. grassley. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record a copy of a newspaper article at the conclusion of my remarks. income inequality has been a hot topic this campaign season. it has become the rallying cry of the left to support their economic agenda. whether it is taxing the rich, raising the minimum wage, combating global warming, or any other number of policies. if you listen to secretary clinton and senator sanders on the campaign trail, you would get the impression that income inequality is the fault of republicans. they contend that their preferred policies will close the gap between the rich and the poor. however, the inconvenient fact is that inequality rose considerably more under president clinton than it did under president reagan. further, it has increased more under president obama than it did under president bush. for any of my colleagues wondering how this could be the case, i would encourage them to read lawrence lindsey's op-ed that ran in the wall street journal in march. mr. lindsey's article title ``how progressives drive income inequality'' details how liberal policies have not only failed to reduce income inequality, but may in fact be contributing to it. for instance, my colleagues on the left all too frequently look to ever richer and more expansive transfer payment programs as the solution. however, too often our existing transfer programs meant to help the less fortunate act as an anchor preventing americans from climbing up the income ladder. this risks creating a permanent underclass of citizens that are dependent on the state for their basic needs. that may be the dream of european- style social democrats, but it is most certainly not the american dream. the congressional budget office looks at this effect in terms of marginal effective tax rates on low and moderate income workers. this refers to how much extra tax or reduction in government benefits is imposed on an--american worker when he or she earns an additional dollar of income. cbo estimates that in 2016 those under 450% of the federal poverty level will face an average effective tax rate of about 41%. keep in mind that this is just the average. cbo demonstrates how a substantial number of workers could experience marginal effective rates exceeding 50, 60, or even 80%, which is far higher than the top statutory rate of 39.6% paid by the wealthiest americans. the end result is a worker facing these rates may just decide it doesn't make much sense to take on extra hours or put in the effort to learn extra skills to increase their earnings potential. historically, this has impacted married women in the workforce most of all as they are more likely than men to drop out of the workforce completely as a result. discouraging individuals from entering the labor force, taking on more work hours, gaining extra experience, or learning new skills, is a recipe for stagnate incomes and increased income disparity. but, far from seeking to address these work disincentive effects, president obama has made it worse for millions of workers. take the premium tax credit enacted as part of the affordable care act for instance. cbo estimates it will raise marginal tax rates by an estimated 12 percentage points for recipients. secretary clinton and senator sanders also have provided no indication they would reverse this trend. in fact, they appear to only be interested in exacerbating this problem through richer transfer programs, increased costs on employers, and increased payroll taxes. the scapegoat of the income inequality debate on the left has, of course, been the much-hyped top 1 percent. here we are told that if we just tax the rich, we can solve all of our problems and address income inequality in one fell swoop. but, if increased taxes on the wealthy is a solution to income inequality, why--as i pointed out at the start of this speech--did income inequality grow faster under president clinton than under president reagan? and why has income inequality grown faster under president obama than under president bush? the fact of the matter is that taxing the wealthy to reduce income inequality at best is a fool's errand and at worst could be a blow to our economy--potentially harming individuals at all income levels. a recent research paper by the liberal brookings institution looked directly into the question of whether substantially increasing taxes on the wealthy would reduce income inequality. to quote their findings, ``an increase in the top tax rate leads to an almost imperceptible reduction in overall income inequality, even if the additional revenue is explicitly redistributed.'' raising taxes might be successful at generating revenue to fund greater wealth transfer payments. but it does nothing to rectify the ``opportunity gap.'' soak the rich policies do not create greater opportunity for low- income individuals. in fact, wealth transfer policies often have the perverse effect of trapping their intended beneficiaries in soul- crushing government dependency. moreover, because of their negative effects on economic growth and capital formation, they can reduce opportunity for all americans. you do not have to take my word for the anti-growth effects of increasing taxes. research by christina romer, president obama's former chief economist, found that a tax increase of 1% of gdp reduces economic growth by as much as 3%. according to this study, tax increases have such a substantial effect on economic growth because of the ``powerful negative effect of tax increases on investment.'' in effect, what those who pursue wealth-destroying redistributionist policies are really saying--to quote margaret thatcher--is that they ``would rather that the poor were poorer, provided that the rich were less rich.'' that may result in less differences in wealth between americans, but the expense of making us all worse off. our goal must be to create wealth and opportunity for all americans. we should reject the notion that in order to improve the lot of one individual, someone else must be made worse off. the leadership of other side has become fixated on redistributing the existing economic pie. the better policy is to increase the size of the pie. when this occurs, no one is made better off at the expense of anyone else. [[page s2813]] this is best achieved through pro-growth policies aimed at growing the economic pie, not by taking from some and giving to others. instead of seeking to reduce inequality by knocking the top down a few pegs on the income ladder, policies should be focused on helping individuals climb upwards by tearing down barriers that stand in their way. we all agree with the need for a sound safety net to protect the most vulnerable among us. but when that safety net begins to act like an anchor holding people back, we need to be brave enough to chart a new course. this is what we sought to do with welfare reforms in 1994 through work requirements and incentives. it is once again time for us to review and reform programs so as to minimize as much as possible the current built-in work disincentives from transfer programs that i discussed earlier. another often overlooked issue is the burden overregulation imposes on low-income individuals. dr. mclaughlin of the mercatus center in testimony before a senate judiciary subcommittee hearing earlier this year discussed two negative impacts regulation can have on low-income households. first, while it is well recognized that regulations can increase transaction costs for businesses, it is equally true that consumers feel the costs in the form of higher prices. since low-income households tend to spend, rather than save, a much larger share of their income, they are the ones hit hardest by the regulatory costs. in this regard, regulation acts much like a regressive tax on the consumption of those that are the least well off. a second point made by dr. mclaughlin is that regulations can often create a barrier to entry. setting out on one's own to start a business is as american as apple pie. it is an avenue that americans throughout history have taken to climb from the poor house to the penthouse. but, the cost imposed by entry regulations can too often stand in the way. this directly limits opportunities of lower-income individuals who are the least likely to be able to cut through the red tape and have money on hand to afford the associated costs. research by dr. mclaughlin directly links entry regulations with income inequality. his study looked at the relationship between regulation and income inequality across 175 countries and found that stringent entry regulations are correlated with significantly higher levels of income inequality. on the campaign trail we have heard senator sanders sing the virtues of denmark in his crusade against inequality. interestingly enough, denmark scores very well in the world bank's ``ease of doing business'' ranking, which looks at the cost, time, and overall red tape in starting and running a business. in fact, denmark is ranked third, while the u.s. lags behind in seventh and has been consistently falling backwards since 2008. while senator sanders points to denmark as a model for the u.s. due to its tax and social welfare policies, it is denmark's regulatory efficiency that deserves our attention. in addition to reducing unnecessary regulatory barriers and built-in work disincentives, there is no question we need to do a better job ensuring individuals have the skills necessary to compete in the 21 century economy. there has been considerable research demonstrating that the widening wage gap between skilled and unskilled labor has contributed to the growth in income inequality. i consistently hear from employers in iowa who cannot find enough skilled workers to fill well-paying jobs. if we are to reduce income inequality, we must first reduce opportunity inequality. we have an excellent system of community colleges in iowa that train iowans for jobs that are available in iowa, but those who are chronically unemployed tend to lack the so-called ``soft skills'' that are necessary to hold down a job. in order to eliminate opportunity inequality, we must get back to the notion of the inherent dignity of work and ensure that hard work pays off. these are just a few areas we should be able to work together on to increase opportunities for those least well off among us. increasing opportunity should be our focus, not pitting american against american based on their socioeconomic status. if we make increased opportunity our focus, no one is required to be made worse off to benefit someone else. in fact, by tearing down barriers standing in the way of hardworking americans, all americans will benefit from higher productivity, higher wages, and higher economic growth. my colleagues on the other side who are truly interested in reducing poverty and inequality should abandon their divisive politics of envy and class warfare instead, work with republicans on an agenda focused on economic growth and opportunity to benefit all americans. i yield the floor. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: [mar. 4, 2016] how progressives drive income inequality (by lawrence b. lindsey) hillary clinton and bernie sanders are promising all types of programs to make america a more equal country. that's no surprise. but when you look at performance and not rhetoric, the administrations of political progressives have made the distribution of income more unequal than their adversaries, who supposedly favor the wealthy. the census bureau releases annual updates on income distribution in the u.s., publishing three technical statistical measures--the gini index, the mean logarithmic deviation of income (mean log deviation for short), and the theil index--each of which represents inequality levels on a scale of 0 to 1 (zero signifies perfect equality and 1 indicates perfect inequality). by all three measures, inequality rose more under bill clinton than under ronald reagan. and it wasn't even close. while the inequality increase as measured by the gini index was only slightly more during clinton's two terms, the theil index and mean log deviation increased two and three times as much, respectively. barack obama's administration follows this pattern, despite the complaints he and his supporters have made about his predecessor. the mean log deviation increased 37% more under mr. obama than under president george w. bush, although when this statistic was released, mr. obama had only six years as president compared with mr. bush's eight. the gini index rose more than three times as much under mr. obama than under mr. bush. the theil index increased sharply during the obama administration, while it fell slightly under bush 43. sure, no president intends to raise inequality. and the spin doctors for messrs. clinton and obama may insist that it wasn't their fault. but consider their policies. both democratic presidents presided over bubble economies fueled by easy monetary policy. there is no better way to make the rich richer than to run policies that push up the price of financial assets. cheap money is a boon to those who have access to it. interest rates were also too low under bush 43, but that bubble was in housing, and the effects were therefore more evenly distributed than under mr. clinton's stock-market bubble or mr. obama's credit bubble. money matters, but so do other policies, such as the long, historic sweep of the expanding welfare state. in 1968, government transfer payments totaled $53 billion or roughly 7% of personal income. by 2014, these had climbed to $2.5 trillion--about 17% of personal income. despite the redistribution of a sixth of all income, inequality measured by all three of the census bureau's indexes is far higher today than in 1968. transfer payments under mr. obama increased by $560 billion. by contrast private-sector wages and salaries grew by $1.1 trillion. so for every $2 in extra wages, about $1 was paid out in extra transfer payments--lowering the relative reward to work. forty-five million people received food stamps in mid-2015, an increase of 46% since the end of 2008. similarly, 71.6 million individuals were enrolled in medicaid and the children's health insurance program, an increase of 13.3 million since october 2013. in 2008, during the deepest recession in 75 years, 13.2% of americans lived below the government's official poverty line. the great recession officially ended in june 2009, but in 2014, after five years of economic expansion, 14.8% of americans were still in poverty. the economy was better, and there were a lot more handouts, but still poverty rose. the structure of american households shows how this happened. from 2008 through 2014, the most recent year for which we have data, the number of two-earner households declined. these two-earner households have become the backbone of the american middle class. research by the hamilton project and the urban institute show that when families with children making between $20,000 and $50,000 attempt to have a second earner go back to work, the effective tax rate on the extra earnings--including lost government benefits such as food stamps, the earned-income tax credit, and medical support payments--is between 50% and 80%. this phaseout of the ever increasing array of benefits has created a ``working-class trap'' instead of a ``poverty trap'' that is increasing inequality and keeping the income of these households lower than they might otherwise be. while the number of two-earner households declined during the first six years of the [[page s2814]] obama presidency, the number of single-earner households rose by 2.6 million and the number of households with no earners rose by almost five million. in other words, two thirds of the increase in the number of families under mr. obama was accounted for by households with no one working. this is the reason the middle class has shrunk, and the reason inequality has increased. and unless we increase the number of people wanting to work and the number of jobs through economic growth, inequality will only increase. the flip side of the progressive agenda to redistribute income to those with less is to raise taxes on the ``rich.'' the data show that it is also an ineffective way to reduce inequality. president clinton increased the top tax rate on higher earners--yet inequality rose during his administration, and faster than under the tax-cutting ronald reagan. the same happened under president obama. tax rates went up on upper- income earners. inequality rose too, and more than under his tax-cutting predecessor. a recent brookings institution study--whose authors include peter orszag, president obama's director of the office of management and budget--found that boosting the top tax rates even more, as sen. sanders suggests, would have little or no effect on inequality. the paper explored the effects of raising the highest marginal income-tax rate to 50% from 39.6%. assuming no behavioral effects, the expected revenue was then distributed directly (and in theory costlessly) to the bottom 20% of income earners. the $95 billion in extra taxes and transfers reduced the gini coefficient by only 0.003. to put that in perspective, that reversed only one fifth of the increase in inequality during the obama presidency. there was a catch. when the authors assumed that there might be a behavioral response by higher income taxpayers, inequality fell--but for the wrong reasons. less work, saving, investing and more tax sheltering reduced the taxable income of higher earners and therefore meant less revenue to redistribute so the rich got poorer, by their own choice, but the poor got less in benefits. a true lose-lose situation. none of this should really be surprising. if the socialist ideal of ``from each according to his ability, to each according to his need'' worked in practice, the berlin wall might still be standing. of course, one of the reasons it came down is that a new ruling class emerged to take from the productive and give to those in need, siphoning off a cut of the swag along the way. ruling classes always have sticky fingers. redistribution through the political process is not costless--even in a perfect world there would be a large bureaucracy to feed. special-interest elites also emerge when so much money is being moved around. they take their cut, introducing even more inefficiency into the system. presidential contenders who boast of their plans to reduce inequality might ponder the fact that providing more free things is not the answer. even free college and free health care are paid with taxes that discourage people from increasing their work, savings and entrepreneurship. attacking the rich and running against inequality may be a sensible political strategy. but in the end the programs to implement this strategy make the problem worse. yet advocates come back and demand the same programs. that is perilously close to the definition of insanity attributed to einstein: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. the repeated failure of political promises has another downside--increasing voter alienation and cynicism. the appeal of redistribution is understandable, but voters who think the progressives running today are going to reduce inequality are falling into the same trap as people entering fifth or sixth marriages--the triumph of hope over experience. the presiding officer. the senator from maine. ____________________",19880

CREC-2016-05-16-pt1-PgS2819-2,CREC-2016-05-16,114,NATIONAL POLICE WEEK,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2819-S2820] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL POLICE WEEK Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will be submitting a bipartisan resolution to commemorate National Police Week, which this year began on Sunday, May 15, and ends on Saturday, May 21. Senator Leahy and 52 others have joined me as original cosponsors of the measure. The theme of this year's Police Week is ``Honoring Our Heroes.'' National Police Week is dedicated to the brave men and women in blue who selflessly protect and serve our communities every hour of every day of every week and in every community across the United States. The week affords an opportunity to honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice while striving to make our neighborhoods safer and more secure. Multiple events have taken place in Washington, DC over the past week to not only remember those officers who tragically lost their lives in the line of duty but also to honor outstanding acts of valor and service by many others. Tens of thousands of police officers as well as their friends and family members have gathered in our nation's capital for these events, which included the Annual Blue Mass, a Candlelight Vigil and a Police Unity Tour Arrival Ceremony, among others. Yesterday was National Peace Officers Memorial Day and thousands gathered on the West Front of the Capitol for the 35th Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service. This solemn service offered an opportunity for all of us to pay our respects to fallen officers and the families, communities, and law enforcement agencies that have been permanently altered because they paid the ultimate sacrifice. We owe these brave men and women our utmost respect and gratitude as we honor their noble profession this week. Each of the officers killed in the line of duty this year started their shift with the same goals: do some good, backup my fellow officers, and return home safely. Some of these officers had dedicated decades of their lives to protecting their communities. One of these officers was murdered mere hours after being sworn to her oath of service. At the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, the names of some 200 Iowans are inscribed amongst their law enforcement family. Carved into the Memorial's walls are the names of more than 20,000 men and [[Page S2820]] women who have been killed in the line of duty throughout U.S. history. Each are unique in their own personal stories but they are uniform in their fidelity to truth and justice. The individuals are heroes, not because of the manner in which they died but because time and again they answered a call to do right, impervious to the constant lurking of danger. Regrettably, 123 new names of officers killed in the line of duty in 2015 will be added to the rolls this week and we know that they will not be the last. Mr. President, the men and women of law enforcement make sacrifices both big and small, frequently missing family celebrations and holidays because they believe in serving something greater than themselves. The work of law enforcement is not a job, it is a calling. That calling and those officers' devotion to duty merits our admiration and we are deeply indebted to them. I call on all Americans this week to pause and contemplate the safety and security they enjoy. We all must recognize that such peace is the result of sacrifices made by the brave men and women of law enforcement. I also want to take this opportunity to urge my colleagues to support this year's resolution designating National Police Week. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2819-S2820] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL POLICE WEEK Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, hopefully this week the Senate will vote on legislation to reauthorize key elements of the Adam Walsh Act. I supported this important law when it was first enacted nearly 10 years ago, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this reauthorization bill. Over the years, I have worked closely with John Walsh and others who have been such tireless advocates on behalf of missing and exploited children. And as a Senator and former prosecutor, but most importantly, as a father and a grandfather, I take seriously my duty to protect the children of Vermont and every community throughout the country. The Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act will reauthorize two important programs that assist State and local law enforcement agencies to monitor and apprehend sex offenders. Specifically, this legislation authorizes the Attorney General to continue providing grants to State and local law enforcement agencies in their efforts to improve sex offender registry systems. The bill also reauthorizes funding for grants to improve information sharing and verification and supports the work of the U.S. Marshals Service in helping State and local law enforcement to locate and apprehend sex offenders who fail to comply with registration requirements. Last Congress, I was proud to help lead the fight to reauthorize the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, which has served for more than three decades as a national clearinghouse on issues related to missing and exploited children. I know that the center works closely with the marshals and other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, and the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act will help further our support for these collaborative efforts. The bill also includes an important set of provisions authored by Senator Shaheen to protect the rights of sexual assault survivors. I want to thank and applaud Senator Shaheen for her hard work and leadership on the Sexual Assault Survivors Rights Act. As an original cosponsor of her bill, I supported the inclusion of her important measure as part of this bill. I encourage all Senators to support this bill. I hope that the House will take it up and promptly pass it so that it can be signed into law by the President. There is no need to delay any longer our support for the Federal, State, and local enforcement agencies that work tirelessly to protect the children of our community. But once this bill becomes law, our job does not end there. It is not sufficient to just pay lip service to this issue and allow Congress to pat itself on the back for passing an authorization bill. Just as we have seen with our efforts to combat the opioid abuse epidemic, a bill that authorizes programs is important and worthy of support, but ultimately an empty promise if it is not backed up with the actual Federal resources that Congress authorizes. I will keep fighting to ensure that Congress puts its money where its mouth is and provides the funding that is necessary to support these important efforts. I will continue fighting to improve our laws so that we protect the most vulnerable in all of our communities. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2820] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADAM WALSH REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2016 Mr. LEAHY.

CREC-2016-05-16-pt1-PgS2822-3,CREC-2016-05-16,114,TRIBUTE TO MARK VAN TINE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2822-S2823] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MARK VAN TINE Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mark Van Tine, vice president of Digital Aviation for the Boeing Company and chief executive officer of Jeppesen. He is retiring after 35 years with the company as a champion of the aviation industry. Mr. Van Tine leads more than 3,800 employees at Jeppesen, which is headquartered in Englewood, CO, and serves general, business, military, and the commercial aviation sectors. Additionally, Jeppesen works closely with the aviation industry to improve the flying experience at Denver International Airport. A new navigation pattern design, for example, allows commercial airline pilots to descend in a single, smooth arc rather than a more traditional stair-step pattern, resulting in lower costs, fewer carbon emissions, and gentler landings. Since 1981, Mr. Van Tine has held numerous positions at Jeppesen, including serving as its chief information officer, before being named CEO in 2002. In 2012, he became the leader of Boeing's new Digital Aviation organization, taking on the tremendous challenge of overseeing Jeppesen's digital transformation. This involved moving the entire global aviation industry to electronic charts, which reduced paperwork and increased efficiency. [[Page S2823]] Mr. Van Tine is also an active contributor to the general aviation community. He sits on the boards of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, GAMA, and the Experimental Aircraft Association, EAA.

Mr. President, this year marks the 100th anniversary of the Webfoot Warriors, the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program at the University of Oregon. As an alumnus of the University of Oregon Law School, I would like to commemorate this milestone. Reserve Officers' Training Corps, or ROTC, is a voluntary program offered at hundreds of schools across the country. Students who meet the eligibility requirements and stick with the program receive subsidized tuition and, after graduation, are commissioned as officers in the U.S. military. The ROTC curriculum consists of courses in military science and history as well as practical skills and leadership training. The ROTC program we know today traces its roots to the National Defense Act of 1916, a bill signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson barely a year before the United States entered World War I. Like many other university administrators of the day, Prince Lucien Campbell, the University of Oregon's president at the time, was a supporter of the program. President Campbell established the first ROTC curriculum at the University of Oregon, placing a retired British military officer-- the appropriately named Lieutenant Colonel John Leader--in charge. More than 100 students participated in the first drill in March 1916. The University of Oregon ROTC program commissioned its first officers in 1919, after the Allied victory in World War I, and the unit has produced some truly top-notch officers in the decades since. In fact, the Army Cadet Command awarded the unit a General Douglas MacArthur Award for the 2014-2015 academic year, recognizing it as one of the top eight Army ROTC programs in the country. According to the unit's records, the University of Oregon has produced more general officers than any nonmilitary ROTC program in the country. The program also counts a total of 47 flag officers among its graduates. As Oregonians, we have long taken pride in serving our State and this great country, and the Webfoot Warriors are hardly an exception. As then-President Campbell put it himself, ``the matter of military training in any school seems to me to be a training for better citizenship, rather than for war.'' Today I say thank you to all of the men and women of the Webfoot Warriors past and present, and I wish the University of Oregon ROTC program another 100 years of success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2823] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, on March 14, 2016, the Salt Lake Community College men's basketball team walked into the Hutchinson Sports Arena in Hutchinson, KS, to play their first game in the NJCAA national tournament, the ``Big Dance'' for America's community colleges, ranked 13th out of 24 highly talented and competitive teams. Six days and five games later, the Salt Lake Bruins walked out as national champions, having bested the home team, Hutchinson Community College, 74 points to 64, in front of a sold-out crowd of more than 6,000 fans. On behalf of the people of Utah, I commend the Salt Lake Community College 2015-2016 men's basketball team for their well-deserved championship. In particular, I applaud the Bruins not just because they won, but because of how they won. When a team is awarded the national title after winning 5 games in 6 days, beating the opposition by an average of more than 18 points, as the Bruins did in Hutchinson, it can be tempting to look back at the season and see a preordained path to the championship. But, as head coach Todd Phillips surely knows, there are no guaranteed victories in basketball, only earned ones, even for a team as storied and successful as Salt Lake Community College. Indeed, the story of the Salt Lake Bruins' championship season is one not of assured success, but obstacles overcome. At the end of the regular season, the Bruins had lost five of their last seven games, finishing third in the Scenic West Athletic Conference, their worst performance in Coach Phillips' five seasons with the team. Entering the regional tournament on a three-game losing streak, the team seemed to be fraying at the edges, their season on the brink of irrelevance. Something wasn't right. The team was playing well below its potential, and everyone knew it. The easy response for the players and the coaches would have been to point fingers, assign blame, and begin looking forward to the fresh start always promised by the next season waiting around the corner. But that is not the Salt Lake way. Instead of giving up, the team doubled down, rebuilding their confidence and rededicating themselves to each other and to their season. And they did this as all good teams must do: together. The Salt Lake Bruins' always have plenty of stand-out athletes, and this season was no exception, but the 12-man roster that took home the national title truly played and won as a team. To the 16 men who earned this championship, as players and as coaches, congratulations. Your legendary season--and the teamwork that made it possible--is an inspiration to the Nation and one of the many reasons I am proud to call Utah home. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2823] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE SLCC MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM Mr. LEE.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Clackamas Community College, CCC, in Clackamas County, OR, on 50 years of continued growth and achievement in providing valuable education to Oregon's citizens. From Gladstone, to Oregon City, to Wilsonville, CCC has grown to include three campuses and two extension sites. Now with campuses educating 35,000 students, CCC still has a community-minded focus and provides its communities with affordable education and training opportunities which aid in creating family-wage jobs.

Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent home; Whereas the primary goal of the foster-care system is to ensure the safety and well-being of children while working to provide a safe, loving, and permanent home for each child; Whereas there are approximately 415,000 children living in foster care; Whereas there were approximately 255,000 youth that entered the foster-care system in 2014, while over 107,500 youth were eligible and awaiting adoption at the end of 2014; Whereas children of color are more likely to stay in the foster-care system for longer periods of time and are less likely to be reunited with their biological families; Whereas foster parents are the front-line caregivers for children who cannot safely remain with their biological parents and provide physical care, emotional support, education advocacy, and are the largest single source of families providing permanent homes for children leaving foster care to adoption; Whereas children in foster care who are placed with relatives, compared to children [[Page S2827]] placed with nonrelatives, have more stability, including fewer changes in placements, have more positive perceptions of their placements, are more likely to be placed with their siblings, and demonstrate fewer behavioral problems; Whereas some relative caregivers receive less financial assistance and support services than do foster caregivers; Whereas recent studies show foster children enrolled in Medicaid were prescribed antipsychotic medications at nearly 4 times the rate of other children receiving Medicaid;

Whereas more than 22,000 youth ``age out'' of foster care without a legal permanent connection to an adult or family; Whereas the number of youth who age out of foster care has steadily increased for the past decade; Whereas foster care is intended to be a temporary placement, but children remain in the foster-care system for an average of 2 years; Whereas children in foster care experience an average of 3 different placements, which often leads to disruption of routines and the need to change schools and move away from siblings, extended families, and familiar surroundings; Whereas children entering foster care often confront the widespread misperception that children in foster care are disruptive, unruly, and dangerous, even though placement in foster care is based on the actions of a parent or guardian, not the child; Whereas children who age out of foster care lack the security or support of a biological or adoptive family and frequently struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain health insurance, pursue higher education, and acquire adequate employment; Whereas on average, 8.5 percent of the positions in child protective services remain vacant; Whereas due to heavy caseloads and limited resources, the average tenure for a worker in child protection services is just 3 years; Whereas States, localities, and communities should be encouraged to invest resources in preventative and reunification services and postpermanency programs to ensure that more children in foster care are provided with safe, loving, and permanent placements;

TOM GRAVES of georgia in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I, along with Representative Wasserman Schultz, rise today to recognize and pay tribute to Carlos Elias on his retirement after 36 years of service to the federal government, 17 years of which were with the Architect of the Capitol. Carlos started his federal career in 1980 with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after graduating from the University of Puerto Rico. Carlos joined the Architect of the Capitol in 1999 as the Deputy Superintendent of the U.S. Capitol Building, and in 2001 was appointed to the position of Superintendent of the U.S. Capitol Building and the Capitol Visitor Center. As Superintendent, Mr. Elias oversees 1.5 million gross square feet and manages 250 employees. In addition to maintenance functions, he is responsible for repairs, modernization, improvements, conservation, preservation, and new construction activities. He also served as lead coordinator for the last four Presidential Inaugurations and he is responsible for the construction of the Inaugural platform, installation of the sound system, security fencing, and all other supporting infrastructure. Mr. Elias is overseeing the $60 million U.S. Dome Restoration Project, the first since 1959. Due to age and weather, the Dome had more than 1,000 cracks and deficiencies. The project was awarded in November 2013 and, with Mr. Elias' management, we expect it to be completed before the Presidential Inauguration--on time and under budget. Our subcommittee has come to depend on Carlos and his team for their exceptional customer service and reliability. In addition, Carlos has provided us with invaluable guidance and analysis throughout the years. Carlos' retirement constitutes a profound loss for the institution. He will not be easily replaced and will be sorely missed. We wish him and his wife, Ana, all the best in this next phase of their lives. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E703] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING CARLOS ELIAS ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, longtime East Dallas constituent, Bill L. ``Bulldog'' Cunningham passed away on April 24, 2016, after a courageous fight with prostate cancer. Born on May 3, 1921, Bulldog grew up in East Dallas. He graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1949 and was a star on the football team. He went to play football at Midwestern State University, but withdrew after one year to join the United States Marine Corps. During his service, he was wounded three times. And awarded the Purple Heart. After leaving Korea, he served the rest [[Page E704]] of his time as a drill instructor at Camp Pendleton. After returning to Dallas, he married his sweetheart, Mina, in 1954. They were blessed with four boys, Gregory, Vickers, William, and Michael. He is survived by Mina, his four sons, eight grandchildren and one great-grandson. It was rare to see Bulldog or Mina separately. Their marriage of over 60 years was an example of a life-long love. The Cunninghams are a very close-knit family. Bulldog made a life-long passion out of his chosen profession of insurance. He based his insurance company in East Dallas. He was a member of the Million Dollar Round Table. In the last year of his life, he was still a national top 10 percent producer for Safeco Insurance. Bulldog was an active political volunteer, along with his wife, Mina. He was very active in the Dallas community, including the Greater East Dallas Chamber of Commerce, in which he was instrumental in their annual Economic Summit, investing a lot of time in building the event, Habitat for Humanity, City of Dallas Planning & Zoning Commission, and numerous other organizations and city boards and commissions. He was inducted into the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame in 2004. Mr. Cunningham will be sorely missed by his family, friends, and the East Dallas community. We have lost a patriotic, hard-working businessman who was the example of who we should all strive to be. My condolences to Mina and the rest of the Cunningham family. Melissa and I are praying for God's comfort on you during this time of loss. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E703-E704] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR.

LINDSAY ______ HON. MARTHA ROBY of alabama in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Colonel John J. Lindsay for dedicating 28 years of honorable service to the United States Army. John and his family's devotion, sacrifice, and commitment to the Nation is worthy of praise and recognition. A native of New York, John was commissioned into the United States Army as a second lieutenant after graduating from the United States Military Academy in 1988. He is a combat proven leader and a highly skilled AH-64D Apache attack helicopter pilot. John is a true professional and scholar, earning a Bachelor of Science in National Security from the United States Military Academy and a Master of Science in Human Resources from Central Michigan University. He is a graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, the Joint Forces Staff College, and the U.S. Army War College Fellowship Program. Upon entrance into the Armed Forces, Colonel Lindsay attended the aviation officer basic course and initial entry rotary wing flight training at Fort Rucker in the 2nd Congressional District of Alabama that I proudly represent. Throughout John's career in Army aviation, he served in a range of assignments from the platoon level to the Department of the Army headquarters staff. His initial assignment was as an aeroscout platoon leader in the Republic of Korea with the 5- 501st Attack Helicopter Battalion, 17th Aviation Brigade. He continued to his second overseas assignment in Wiesbaden, Germany with 5-6 Cavalry Squadron, 12th Aviation Brigade. During his tenure with the 12th Aviation Brigade, he served as squadron liaison officer and squadron adjutant. He later served as the assistant squadron operations officer and headquarters troop Commander in 6-6 Cavalry Squadron, based in Illesheim, Germany. Upon completion of his overseas tour in Germany, he returned to the U.S. and served in multiple duty assignments from the National Training Center (NTC) at Ft. Irwin, CA to the U.S. Army Personnel Command in Alexandria, VA. Later in his career, John returned to the 11th Aviation Regiment and served during the initial invasion of Iraq. The Army selected John to command 1-14th Aviation Battalion at Ft Rucker, AL, where he completed the AH-64D Instructor Pilot course and assumed responsibility of all attack and reconnaissance flight training for the Army. After command, he was assigned to the U.S. Army Human Resources Command where he served as the aviation branch chief and later as the chief of maneuver, fires and effects division. Upon promotion to Colonel, Colonel Lindsay attended the U.S. Army War College Fellowship at the Institute for Defense Analyses in Washington, D.C., and subsequently deployed as the director of the Joint Operations Center (JOC) to U.S. Forces Iraq. In his most recent assignments, he served as a senior advisor to the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and also as the director of army aviation for the Army's G 3/5/7. John was instrumental in the formulation of the Army's Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI), which optimizes the operational capability, deployment and lethality, and deployment in Army Aviation. Mr. Speaker, it has been a sincere pleasure to have worked with Colonel John J. Lindsay over the last three years. On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues in recognizing and commending John for his service to the United States of America. We wish him, his lovely wife Virginia, and their three children, Ian, Emma, and Kevin all the best as they depart the United States Army and continue on their wonderful journey. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E704] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO COLONEL JOHN J.

LINDSAY ______ HON. MARTHA ROBY of alabama in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Colonel John J. Lindsay for dedicating 28 years of honorable service to the United States Army. John and his family's devotion, sacrifice, and commitment to the Nation is worthy of praise and recognition. A native of New York, John was commissioned into the United States Army as a second lieutenant after graduating from the United States Military Academy in 1988. He is a combat proven leader and a highly skilled AH-64D Apache attack helicopter pilot. John is a true professional and scholar, earning a Bachelor of Science in National Security from the United States Military Academy and a Master of Science in Human Resources from Central Michigan University. He is a graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, the Joint Forces Staff College, and the U.S. Army War College Fellowship Program. Upon entrance into the Armed Forces, Colonel Lindsay attended the aviation officer basic course and initial entry rotary wing flight training at Fort Rucker in the 2nd Congressional District of Alabama that I proudly represent. Throughout John's career in Army aviation, he served in a range of assignments from the platoon level to the Department of the Army headquarters staff. His initial assignment was as an aeroscout platoon leader in the Republic of Korea with the 5- 501st Attack Helicopter Battalion, 17th Aviation Brigade. He continued to his second overseas assignment in Wiesbaden, Germany with 5-6 Cavalry Squadron, 12th Aviation Brigade. During his tenure with the 12th Aviation Brigade, he served as squadron liaison officer and squadron adjutant. He later served as the assistant squadron operations officer and headquarters troop Commander in 6-6 Cavalry Squadron, based in Illesheim, Germany. Upon completion of his overseas tour in Germany, he returned to the U.S. and served in multiple duty assignments from the National Training Center (NTC) at Ft.

Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of meeting on March 30 with William ``Bill,'' Dawson of Waldorf; Maryland, in the Fifth Congressional District. Bill is the last living member of the first class of Naval Special Warfare Operators to train for duty with the U.S. Naval Combat Demolition Units that were the precursor to today's Navy SEAL teams. He is ninety-one years old and a retired Washington, D.C. firefighter who remains deeply proud of his service to our nation and to his community. I was honored to receive from him a copy of his book Before They Were SEALS They Were Frogs, which recounts the story of the Naval Combat Demolition Units during the Second World War and his own service in the Pacific. First created in 1943 and led by Lt. Draper L. Kauffman, the first Naval Combat Demolition Units were tasked with the reconnaissance of amphibious landing sites and the demolition of enemy obstacles that would hinder the advance of invading Allied forces. After their specialized training at Fort Pierce in Florida, including the series of grueling tests that is now considered to have been the first-ever ``Hell Week,'' the first Navy ``Frogmen'' deployed to the European and Pacific theaters of operation in support of combat operations. Navy Frogmen were instrumental in clearing obstacles on Omaha Beach and Utah Beach during the Normandy invasion on D-Day in 1944, and many were killed or wounded performing their dangerous missions. In the Pacific, Frogmen demonstrated similar gallantry during the operations to liberate the Philippines, Guam, Borneo, and many other places that had been occupied by Japanese forces and that were instrumental in the advance toward victory. Frogmen were training for cold-water operations in preparation for an anticipated invasion of the Japanese home islands when the war ended. The Underwater Demolition Teams that succeeded the initial Naval Combat Demolition Units saw action in Korea and Vietnam, and it was in the early 1960's that the Navy decided to transition them into the Navy SEAL teams we know today, in a reflection of their broadening role beyond the water's edge. Americans are grateful for the extraordinary service and sacrifices of our Navy SEALs, among the most skilled, experienced, and courageous to serve in defense of our nation. I'm proud to represent many Navy personnel and veterans in Maryland's Fifth District, which is home to Pax River Naval Air Station, the Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Division, and Webster Field. I join in thanking Bill Dawson and all of those who were our nation's first Navy Frogmen for their gallant service in defense of freedom and for their crucial role in the history of U.S. Naval Special Operations. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E705] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE ``FROGMEN'' OF THE U.S. NAVAL COMBAT DEMOLITION UNITS IN WORLD WAR II ______ HON.

HAL RICHARDS ______ HON. JEB HENSARLING of texas in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and congratulate a dear friend, Mayor Hal Richards of Terrell, Texas. Hal is an outstanding community leader and servant for the people of Kaufman County. Hal was born in 1953 in El Paso while his father served in the Army at Fort Bliss. After the military, his father's job as a petroleum engineer took him across Texas to wherever the next oil boom struck. The Richards family even lived in Venezuela for a period of time. Ultimately, the family settled in Garland, Texas where he was an active musician in the Garland High School band and even played in a slightly lesser known garage band, The Monotones. After graduating high school, Hal took his talents to Texas A&M where he served as the drum major in the Fighting Texas Aggie Band. He graduated in 1975 with a degree in political science, and later he earned his MBA. Hal met his wife Christi while at A&M and they married in 1976. They found their way to Terrell in 1981 where he opened a tractor distributorship and raised his family. The folks of Terrell are glad they did. In 2001, Hal sold the tractor dealership and took over his father's manufacturing company, Catco, where he continues to oversee operations. Hal decided to give back to his adopted town and ran for city council, and served for one term before being elected Mayor of Terrell in 2007. As mayor, he has been instrumental in the growth of ``Terrell America,'' the adopted slogan. Hal has served his community in a number of other capacities including: Chairman of the Terrell Chamber of Commerce, Assistant Scout Master, member and past president of the Rotary Club, and his church's vestry. Not surprisingly, Hal was also recently named Citizen of the Year. And if he wasn't busy enough, Hal finally realized a lifelong dream of becoming a pilot in 2003. Hal and Christi have three sons, Jason, Travis and Chad. Like their dad, they are all proud Texas A&M graduates as well. It is truly an honor to represent Hal Richards in the United States House of Representatives. On behalf of the Fifth District of Texas I would like to congratulate Hal for a job well done as Mayor, and thank him for his tireless commitment to his family and community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E705] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR.

BEN RAY LUJAN of new mexico in the house of representatives Wednesday, May 11, 2016 Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's comments on this legislation, and I'm encouraged by the bipartisan support to advance not only my bill, but all of the important bills we are discussing today. I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss some of the stories of those who have faced addiction. Stories from people in my home state of New Mexico--who have faced the challenges of substance abuse and are healthier today and working to improve their communities. As we come here and discuss the importance of various programs and we debate the need for greater investments--which I think we need to address this crisis--let us not lose sight of the people whose lives are at the center of this. Mr. Speaker, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors--everyone is impacted by this drug crisis. I'd like to share Kayla Trujillo's story. Kayla has been in recovery since November of 2014 and is using her experiences to help others struggling with drug addiction. She is working to become a Certified Peer Support Worker. But at the age of 14, Kayla was struggling. ``As a young teen I had no sense of self-worth, no ability to cope with life, and sought things outside myself to help fill the empty void I felt inside,'' she wrote to me. She was also a straight A, honor roll student, because she knew good grades were a ticket to a better life. But one day, she went to her mom's medicine cabinet and found a green bottle labeled Percocet for pain and took three pills. She writes: ``That day I started my thirteen year love/hate affair with opiates that would forever change my life. Once I was physically dependent on opiates I took whatever means necessary to obtain my pills. ``I resorted to faking injuries, stealing my friends' and family members' pain pills, buying pills off the street, and eventually trading sex for pills just to support my daily pain pill habit . . . One day I ran out of pills, was very ill, and there were no pills to be sold so I picked up heroin to stay well. Once introduced to heroin I knew I had to change my way of life before it was too late.'' Kayla checked herself into a rehab facility and got help. But there are too many people who don't have access to the treatment they need. I'd also like to share the story of Joshua Trujillo. Joshua is a Certified Peer Support Worker at Inside Out Recovery in Espanola, New Mexico. He entered recovery after spending 11 years on the streets using drugs and alcohol. He wrote to me to share his story, and I'd like to read from that letter: ``I was in and out of jail for various drug related crimes. I would steal and lie to everyone that came in contact with me just to support my addiction. I attempted to abstain from drugs many times through my own means and would never succeed. In addition, I had been through drug court programs and licensed therapists and could never stay clean. I found it difficult to relate to anyone that had not experienced addiction firsthand. ``In August of 2011 I entered the doors of Inside Out Recovery where I met a Certified Peer Support Worker. Through the CPSW's own experience with addiction I came to believe that I could live my life without drugs. I had finally found someone I could relate to and learn from. Our talks were invaluable in my early recovery because I knew that if the CPSW could stay clean that I could too. The seed of recovery had been planted with that CPSW's experience and I immediately knew I wanted to dedicate the rest of my life toward staying clean and helping the addict that still suffers.''

BEN RAY LUJAN of new mexico in the house of representatives Wednesday, May 11, 2016 Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's comments on this legislation, and I'm encouraged by the bipartisan support to advance not only my bill, but all of the important bills we are discussing today. I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss some of the stories of those who have faced addiction. Stories from people in my home state of New Mexico--who have faced the challenges of substance abuse and are healthier today and working to improve their communities. As we come here and discuss the importance of various programs and we debate the need for greater investments--which I think we need to address this crisis--let us not lose sight of the people whose lives are at the center of this. Mr. Speaker, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors--everyone is impacted by this drug crisis. I'd like to share Kayla Trujillo's story. Kayla has been in recovery since November of 2014 and is using her experiences to help others struggling with drug addiction. She is working to become a Certified Peer Support Worker. But at the age of 14, Kayla was struggling. ``As a young teen I had no sense of self-worth, no ability to cope with life, and sought things outside myself to help fill the empty void I felt inside,'' she wrote to me. She was also a straight A, honor roll student, because she knew good grades were a ticket to a better life. But one day, she went to her mom's medicine cabinet and found a green bottle labeled Percocet for pain and took three pills. She writes: ``That day I started my thirteen year love/hate affair with opiates that would forever change my life. Once I was physically dependent on opiates I took whatever means necessary to obtain my pills. ``I resorted to faking injuries, stealing my friends' and family members' pain pills, buying pills off the street, and eventually trading sex for pills just to support my daily pain pill habit . . . One day I ran out of pills, was very ill, and there were no pills to be sold so I picked up heroin to stay well. Once introduced to heroin I knew I had to change my way of life before it was too late.'' Kayla checked herself into a rehab facility and got help. But there are too many people who don't have access to the treatment they need. I'd also like to share the story of Joshua Trujillo. Joshua is a Certified Peer Support Worker at Inside Out Recovery in Espanola, New Mexico. He entered recovery after spending 11 years on the streets using drugs and alcohol. He wrote to me to share his story, and I'd like to read from that letter: ``I was in and out of jail for various drug related crimes. I would steal and lie to everyone that came in contact with me just to support my addiction. I attempted to abstain from drugs many times through my own means and would never succeed. In addition, I had been through drug court programs and licensed therapists and could never stay clean. I found it difficult to relate to anyone that had not experienced addiction firsthand. ``In August of 2011 I entered the doors of Inside Out Recovery where I met a Certified Peer Support Worker. Through the CPSW's own experience with addiction I came to believe that I could live my life without drugs. I had finally found someone I could relate to and learn from. Our talks were invaluable in my early recovery because I knew that if the CPSW could stay clean that I could too. The seed of recovery had been planted with that CPSW's experience and I immediately knew I wanted to dedicate the rest of my life toward staying clean and helping the addict that still suffers.''

Soon after graduation she accepted a position as the Assistant Principal at Northeast High School, becoming the third African American teacher ever assigned to an all-white high school in Pinellas County. Returning to her own Gibbs High School as Principal, she became the first female African American High School Principal in Pinellas County in 100 years. Most recently, she was an Adjunct Instructor at the University of South Florida. Ms. Shorter is a longtime leader in the African-American community. She was recognized as Tampa Bay's Black Most Influential in 1983 as well as Pinellas County's Educator of the Year for two straight years. Her local successes were recognized on the national level upon an invitation from Secretary of State Colin Powell to President Clinton's Summit on Education Issues from 1997-2000. Ms. Shorter service was not limited only to her work in the educational field. Throughout her life, she displayed a passion for civic engagement. She inspired the next generation of [[Page E707]] leaders in the African-American community by being actively involved in more than a dozen associations. Her most distinct honor was being the President of the Pinellas County High School Principals Association and the minority member for the Florida Association of School Administrators. She currently is a member of the Florida A&M University Alumni Association and has been an active member of the Galilee Missionary Baptist Church, having had longest active membership at 70 plus years.

RAUL M. GRIJALVA of arizona in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of national Senior Corps Week. Older Americans bring a lifetime of skills and experience as parents, workers, and citizens that can be tapped to meet challenges in our communities. For more than four decades Senior Corps, and its three programs-- RSVP, Senior Companions, and Foster Grandparents--have proven to be a highly effective way to engage Americans age 55 and over in meeting national and community needs. Each year Senior Corps provides opportunities for nearly 330,000 older Americans across the nation, including approximately 435 in Southern Arizona, to serve their communities. Foster Grandparents serve one-on-one as tutors and mentors to young Arizonans who have special needs. Senior Companions help homebound Arizona seniors and other adults maintain independence in their own homes. RSVP volunteers conduct safety patrols for local police departments, protect the environment, tutor and mentor youth, respond to natural disasters, and provide other services through more than 130 groups across Arizona. Senior Corps volunteers last year provided more than 96.2 million hours of service, helping to improve the lives of our most vulnerable citizens, strengthen our educational system, protect our environment, provide independent living services, and contribute to our public safety. Senior Corps volunteers build a capacity of organizations and communities by serving through more than 65,000 nonprofit, community, educational, and faith-based community groups nationwide. At a time of mounting social needs and growing interest in service by older Americans, there is an unprecedented opportunity to harness the talents of 55-plus volunteers to address community challenges. Service by older Americans helps volunteers by keeping them active, healthy, and engaged, helps our communities by solving local problems, and helps our nation by saving taxpayer dollars, reducing healthcare costs, and strengthening our democracy. The sixth annual Senior Corps Week, taking place May 16-20, 2016, is a time to thank Senior Corps volunteers for their service and recognize their positive impact and value to our communities and nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E707] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING SENIOR CORPS WEEK AND THE SERVICE OF OLDER AMERICANS ______ HON.

MIKE THOMPSON of california in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 40th anniversary of the Judgment of Paris wine tasting competition, an event that brought global esteem to the California wine community. On May 24, 1976, a who's-who of French wine and food influencers gathered for a blind tasting of Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay wines at the Paris InterContinental Hotel organized by wine merchant Steven Spurrier. Mr. Spurrier selected the finest California vintages at the time. He included Cabernet Sauvignon from Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, Ridge Vineyards Monte Bello, Heitz Wine Cellars, Clos du Val Winery, Mayacamas Vineyards, and Freemark Abbey Winery. In the white wine category, Mr. Spurrier chose Chardonnay from Chateau Montelena Winery, Chalone Vineyard, Spring Mountain Vineyard, Freemark Abbey Winery, Veedercrest Vineyards, and David Bruce Winery. When the experts' scores were tallied, two wines from California's Napa Valley--the 1973 Chateau Montelena Winery Chardonnay by winemaker Miljenko ``Mike'' Grgich and the Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1973 Cabernet Sauvignon made by Warren Winiarski--came out on top, forever changing the way the world views American wine. George Taber documented this consequential decision in a TIME magazine article, ``Modern Living: Judgment of Paris.'' The resulting coverage of the Judgment of Paris created an immediate and positive impact on the world of wine, and inspired among experts, consumers, and the trade a new appreciation for California wines. The Napa Valley is now recognized internationally as the vanguard of the American wine business. The California wine community now adds $61.5 billion to the state's economy and $121.8 billion to the United States economy. The wine community supports 330,000 jobs in the state and brings more than 21 million visitors to California wine regions annually. Wine is now produced in all fifty of the United States, and enjoyed at ever increasing levels by consumers throughout the country. Mr. Speaker, it is fitting and proper that we recognize and honor the historical significance of the 40th anniversary of this event, as well as the impact of the California victory on the world of wine and the United States wine industry as a whole. To recognize the 40th anniversary of the Judgment of Paris, Rep. Duncan Hunter and I, House Leadership from both sides of the aisle, and the entire California delegation will submit the following language as a resolution: Whereas forty years ago in Paris, a number of leading French wine experts were invited by Wine Merchant Stephen Spurrier to blind taste some of the greatest wines of France and California; Whereas those prestigious experts chose the 1973 Chateau Montelena Winery Napa Valley Chardonnay by winemaker Miljenko ``Mike'' Grgich as the finest white wine in the tasting; Whereas those same experts chose the 1973 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars S.L.V.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Jerome Edward Gaff, May 30, 1946, in recognition of his outstanding service to the United States Army. Jerry is the son of John M. and Dorothy A. Gaff who raised Jerry in Chelsea, MA. Jerry grew up alongside his brothers Harold, Jack, Tom, and sister, Loretta. Jerry and his family relocated to Everett MA, where he made his residence from 1950-1969. He graduated from Everett High School in 1964, and soon after, began working at General Edwards Inn Restaurant in the Point of Pines Section of Revere with his brothers and sisters. He was drafted into the U.S. Army on April 19, 1969, where he served his tour of duty in Vietnam from September 1969 to November 1970. While serving in the Army, he served with the 1st Infantry Division (Big Red One) Sept. 1969 to Mar. 1970 and the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (Black Horse) Mar. 1970 to Nov. 1970. He was stationed at the U.S. Army base located in Lai Khe, northwest of Saigon. During his time in the Army he was active in the major battle of the Cambodian Incursion from May to June, 1970. He received several medals for his Army service including: National Defense Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Bronze Star Medal and the Vietnam Campaign Medal. Although Jerry is a decorated veteran of the Vietnam Conflict he seldom spoke of his distinguished military career, and upon returning stateside focused his attention to raising his family, but never forgot those who served with him, and stills serves as an advocate for all veterans today. When he returned from the war, he continued to work at the General Edwards Inn. He attended college before and after the war, studying education and Spanish. In 1972, he was married and had four daughters, Nancy 42, Shannon 41, Lauren 39 and Marybeth 38. Jerry and his family moved to Sandown, NH in the summer of 1978, just prior to the opening of his restaurant The Village Square Inn, located in Hampstead, NH. Jerry was owner/chef at the restaurant through the early 90's. He continued to be a well-respected chef in the southern New Hampshire area until his recent retirement. In his retirement, Jerry enjoys [[Page E709]] his summers at the lake and spending time with his friends and family, including his girlfriend Gail and his nine grandchildren. Jerry is an avid sports fan, who excelled in hockey as a young man, is an outstanding horseshoe player, excellent cribbage player, and fisherman. Jerry has positively influenced everyone in his lifetime and is the definition of what it means to be a Father, Grandfather, and Friend. Mr. Speaker, Jerry is a true gentleman and is known for being funny, kind and caring. He continues to support his fellow veterans by meeting with others at his local Veterans hospitals/clinics. His dedication to those he served with is only exceeded by his dedication to his family and friends. Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate Jerry on the occasion of his 70th birthday. I find it only fitting that we honor Jerry's lifetime of accomplishments as a testament of his excellent military service, outstanding character, his positive influence on all those who have met him, and his commitment to his family and community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E708-E709] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF THE HONORABLE JEROME E.

To prevent terrorist travel, the Department of Homeland Security has ``pushed out our borders'' by expanding its presence and partnerships around the world to ensure vetting of passengers well in advance of their arrival in the United States. Today, I am introducing the ``Expanding DHS Overseas Passenger Security Screening and Vetting Operations Act'' to enhance DHS' overseas operations that vet and screen foreign travelers to the United States by, among other things: Requiring DHS to use a strategic, risk-based, and coordinated approach to expand overseas operations; Increasing U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) capacity to screen additional passengers and facilitate travel by authorizing an additional 2,000 CBP Officers and 600 Agriculture Specialists to address existing domestic staffing shortages, particularly at U.S. international airports, while expanding overseas operations; and Expanding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) visa vetting operations by directing ICE to stand up an additional 50 Visa Security Units at overseas visa-issuing posts abroad and authorizing the PATRIOT automated visa vetting program at 50 additional high-risk locations.

CREC-2016-05-16-pt1-PgE709-2,CREC-2016-05-16,114,CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF BOWIE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E709] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF BOWIE ______ HON. STENY H. HOYER of maryland in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark an important milestone in the history of the Fifth District and the State of Maryland. This year, the City of Bowie celebrates the centennial of its incorporation, which took place on April 18, 1916. In the intervening century, Bowie has grown and flourished, becoming the fifth-largest city in Maryland and a vibrant and diverse community. Bowie has its roots in a small village called Huntington City that developed in 1870 alongside a railroad depot named for Maryland Governor Oden Bowie, a local resident who had been instrumental in bringing the railroad to the area. Within twelve years, the village had grown into a small town of several streets lined with shops and houses, which was renamed Bowie after the rail station. When the Town of Bowie was first incorporated in 1916, its first commissioners were R.P. Watts, William Luers, and Thomas P. Littlepage, who held their town meetings in the Knights of St. John Hall, which still stands today. In the 1950's, Bowie began to spread south of the original railroad settlement to include new suburban developments.

Today, the city operates under the same charter as it adopted in 1916 and is home to approximately 56,000 Marylanders. While still retaining the feel of a small town, Bowie has grown to include a number of new suburban developments that have brought diversity and economic opportunity that are benefitting the residents of Bowie and the surrounding area. I'm honored to represent the City of Bowie and its residents in Congress. Bowie continues to follow an upward trajectory of growth and development, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Mayor and city officials to ensure that Bowie has all the resources it requires to succeed. I hope my colleagues will join me in marking this important milestone for Bowie and wishing it much success as it enters its second century of incorporation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E709] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF BOWIE ______ HON. STENY H. HOYER of maryland in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark an important milestone in the history of the Fifth District and the State of Maryland. This year, the City of Bowie celebrates the centennial of its incorporation, which took place on April 18, 1916. In the intervening century, Bowie has grown and flourished, becoming the fifth-largest city in Maryland and a vibrant and diverse community. Bowie has its roots in a small village called Huntington City that developed in 1870 alongside a railroad depot named for Maryland Governor Oden Bowie, a local resident who had been instrumental in bringing the railroad to the area. Within twelve years, the village had grown into a small town of several streets lined with shops and houses, which was renamed Bowie after the rail station. When the Town of Bowie was first incorporated in 1916, its first commissioners were R.P. Watts, William Luers, and Thomas P. Littlepage, who held their town meetings in the Knights of St. John Hall, which still stands today. In the 1950's, Bowie began to spread south of the original railroad settlement to include new suburban developments.

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the life of Jerry Clark, who passed away in February. Jerry was a standout civic leader who was devoted to the people of the District and its causes. Jerry Clark was also a particularly avid leader of our D.C. statehood movement and a leader in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. Because the District has been fighting for equal citizenship rights for its entire two centuries of existence, Jerry's consistently devoted leadership stands out through ups and downs, whether on the nuts and bolts or the big issues, without fanfare. Jerry, who was born in Indiana, was there for D.C. without fail, carrying the banner of freedom for his adopted city. Jerry brought similar vigor to other causes and endeavors. A graduate of Princeton University and the University of Chicago Law School, Jerry completed his doctoral studies and then spent his career dedicated to workers as executive director of the United Mine Workers Health and Retirement Funds. At the same time, Jerry threw himself into work for LGBT rights. That work earned Jerry the Distinguished Service Award for exemplary and dedicated work for the LGBT community in the District of Columbia from the D.C. Gay and Lesbian Activists Alliance. His work was so widespread in the District that former D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray appointed Clark to the Mayor's committee on the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington. Our city has lost a true crusader who never stopped standing up for equality for the disenfranchised. Among the many organizations that have benefited from Jerry's service are the Gertrude Stein Democratic Club, the National LGBTQ Task Force, the DC for Democracy, DC Statehood Coalition, Bread for the Soul, Ward 1 Democrats, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, the Law and Society Association, the Whitman-Walker HealthSpring Gala, and the Democratic National Committee Gay and Lesbian Leadership Council. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join me in honoring the full and productive life of Jerry Clark and for his dedicated work with District of Columbia residents, for D.C. Statehood, for the LGBT community, and for workers. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E709] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING JERRY CLARK ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my dear friend, Evalynn (``Evy'') Diamond. Evy represented the best of our great State of New Mexico: she was a loving wife and mother, a loyal friend to so many, a brilliant, hard-working and talented teacher, and a dedicated activist in our community. Evy and her husband of 40 years, Jeff, met in 1975 when they were both teaching at Temple Beth Shalom in Santa Ana, California. They shared a love for the state of Israel and became active in the Anti- Defamation League (ADL). She and Jeff fund ADL's A World of Difference program in Haifa which fosters tolerance between Jewish, Christian, and Muslim children. Evy made frequent trips to Israel to meet with Israeli leaders, journalists, and other activists, whether Jewish or Muslim, to uphold the values of the ADL. She was a committed activist who dedicated much of her life to promoting peace and cooperation. In addition to her work with the ADL, Evy worked tirelessly with Jeff to promote and fund cancer research. After their son Shannon died from melanoma on August 31, 2009, they established a fund in his memory at the University of New Mexico Cancer Center Foundation. [[Page E710]] The fund seeks to educate the public about early diagnosis, preventions and treatment of melanoma in medically underserved communities in New Mexico. Whether working with the ADL or funding cancer research, Evy has consistently demonstrated her compassion and devotion to fighting for important causes. However, Evy's greatest love, after Jeff and her sons, was her career as a teacher. She was an outstanding educator who instilled a love of learning, hard work, and excellence in all her students. Those students have gone on to become leaders in law enforcement, health care, and many other professions throughout our community. Indeed, we need more teachers like Evy who devote themselves to their students with passion and find innovative ways to teach and support her students. On April 18, 2016, at the age of 84, Evy passed away in her home in Carlsbad with Jeff and her son, Max Shaw, at her side. In addition to her husband Jeff and her son Max, she is survived by Shannon's wife, Christine, and their two children, Jacob and Marlena Shaw Davis. Evy was a true friend whom we will all miss dearly. I cherish our friendship and all of the wonderful contributions she has made to our state. Her memory and legacy is a blessing to us all. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E709-E710] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING EVALYNN DIAMOND ______ HON.

MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO of guam in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend and congratulate nurses and school nurse support staff of the Guam Department of Education (GDOE) in honor of the 2016 National School Nurses Day. There are currently 44 Registered Nurses and 3 Licensed Practical Nurses serving the students of the Guam Department of Education. These nurses take on the daunting task of caring for the Guam Department of Education's more than 30,000 students and nearly 4,000 employees of the Guam Department of Education. These school nurses work day in and day out to remove the barriers to learning and ensure the health of our island's children. Guam Department of Education nurses join the National Association of School Nurses in celebrating the theme of this year's School Nurses Day: Better Health; Better Learning. They also join the American Nurses Association in celebrating the 2016 Nurses Week: Culture of Safety; It Starts With You! GDOE nurses have chosen to celebrate National School Nurses Day by teaching students how to conduct hands only CPR. Every year the GDOE nurses serve a critical role in providing a safe and healthy learning environment for students throughout Guam's public elementary, middle, and high schools. GDOE nurses provide frontline, critical care for the most fragile children in our community and are members of health teams that support both educational and response initiatives dedicated to improving public health. Additionally, school nurses are liaisons to the school administrators, parents and healthcare providers when it comes to attending to the physical health of our island's students. Every school year is different and challenging for the GDOE nurses. In April, the school nurses received a call from the Department of Public Health and Social Services asking them to administer 5,000 doses of TB skin test solution to GDOE students and staff who need updates. The school nurses embraced the challenge and were able to host TB clinics in almost every GDOE school for students and staff. Despite these challenges, our island's school nurses have responded to these needs with professionalism and passion for the school communities they serve. I commend and congratulate nurses and school nurse support staff of the Guam Department of Education (GDOE) as they celebrate the 2016 National School Nurses Day and on a successful school year. I join the people of Guam in expressing our appreciation for their contributions to Guam's school communities. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E710] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING GUAM DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SCHOOL NURSES ______ HON.

Every year the GDOE nurses serve a critical role in providing a safe and healthy learning environment for students throughout Guam's public elementary, middle, and high schools. GDOE nurses provide frontline, critical care for the most fragile children in our community and are members of health teams that support both educational and response initiatives dedicated to improving public health. Additionally, school nurses are liaisons to the school administrators, parents and healthcare providers when it comes to attending to the physical health of our island's students. Every school year is different and challenging for the GDOE nurses. In April, the school nurses received a call from the Department of Public Health and Social Services asking them to administer 5,000 doses of TB skin test solution to GDOE students and staff who need updates. The school nurses embraced the challenge and were able to host TB clinics in almost every GDOE school for students and staff. Despite these challenges, our island's school nurses have responded to these needs with professionalism and passion for the school communities they serve.

I join the people of Guam in expressing our appreciation for their contributions to Guam's school communities. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E710] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING GUAM DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SCHOOL NURSES ______ HON.

EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of texas in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize the significant leadership of a selfless educator and inspirational woman, Carol Ann Mooney. After a storied career in Catholic education in South Bend, Indiana, Mrs. Mooney will be retiring from her position as president of St. Mary's College after holding that title for twelve years. Mrs. Mooney's love for St. Mary's is tried and true, seeing as she is the first lay alumna President of the university. She attended St. Mary's from 1968-1972, then made the short physical but grand intellectual journey to the University of Notre Dame Law School, where she graduated first in her class. After a stint in law firms here in Washington D.C., she returned to South Bend to join the University of Notre Dame Law School's faculty, in her journey holding the titles of assistant dean, associate dean, university vice president, and associate provost. In 2004, she was delighted to return to the alma mater that she and I share to become its first alumna president. Mrs. Mooney's tenure at St. Mary's is defined by her deep love for the school. Under her leadership, the school saw unprecedented growth with a record-breaking fundraising campaign, underwent a lengthy accreditation process with the Higher Learning Commission, rapidly expanded diversity on the campus, and launched three graduate programs. More than anything, Mrs. Mooney will be remembered as a mentor, who was available to talk to students always. The young women of St. Mary's College will certainly miss Mrs. Mooney, but not as much as she will miss seeing them as she has for the better portion of her life. During retirement, Mrs. Mooney and her husband will stay in South Bend, but plan to visit their four children and grandchild as much as possible. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the selfless dedication this woman has given to educating young people and shaping the future generation of leaders and thinkers. For this she deserves our undue respect, admiration, and praise--though her humility will likely not allow her to accept it.

In 1962, Congress established National Police Week to pay our respects to officers who died in the line of duty, as well as those who continue to serve. This is a week for all of us to join together and show support for these heroes in blue. It is because of their tireless--and sometimes unnoticed--work that we remain safe in our homes. Their commitment to our community deserves our gratitude and appreciation, and their service is an example to all of us. As Representative of North Carolina's eighth district, I'm committed to making sure our law enforcement officers have the tools needed to do their jobs. Just last week, the House passed five bills supporting our law enforcement community, including legislation to protect our police forces' access to bulletproof vests and enable them to carry their firearms when off-duty. Mr. Speaker, these brave men and women continue to serve our communities year after year, and it's important to offer them our sincere gratitude. I ask my fellow Americans, to join me in reflecting on the sacrifice of our fallen officers, honoring those who are currently serving, and saying a big thank you to these heroes and their families. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E711] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN NORTH CAROLINA'S 8TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT ______ HON.

RICHARD HUDSON of north carolina in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the brave men and women who faithfully serve in North Carolina's 8th District as law enforcement officers. In 1962, Congress established National Police Week to pay our respects to officers who died in the line of duty, as well as those who continue to serve. This is a week for all of us to join together and show support for these heroes in blue. It is because of their tireless--and sometimes unnoticed--work that we remain safe in our homes. Their commitment to our community deserves our gratitude and appreciation, and their service is an example to all of us. As Representative of North Carolina's eighth district, I'm committed to making sure our law enforcement officers have the tools needed to do their jobs. Just last week, the House passed five bills supporting our law enforcement community, including legislation to protect our police forces' access to bulletproof vests and enable them to carry their firearms when off-duty.

CREC-2016-05-16-pt1-PgE711-2,CREC-2016-05-16,114,THE AGENT ORANGE RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2016,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E711] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE AGENT ORANGE RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2016 ______ HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in effort to heal the post-conflict, human cost of war by caring for the children of our Vietnam veterans living with Spina Bifida resulting from Agent Orange exposure. Spina Bifida, which literally means ``split spine,'' is a condition in which a baby's spinal column fails to close properly during pregnancy. Typically, an adult with Spina Bifida may suffer from nerve damage, paralysis, and difficulty completing ordinary, day-to-day tasks, and generally, surgery must be performed within 24 hours of the child's birth to minimize the risk of further damage due to infection, and to preserve any remaining function in the spinal cord. In many cases, those suffering from Spina Bifida require costly surgeries and extensive medical care because of potential paralysis resulting from damage to the spinal cord. Thankfully, due to medical advances, most children born with Spina Bifida live well into their adulthood. The Department of Veterans Affairs presumes a link between Vietnam- era veterans exposed to herbicides such as Agent Orange, and the incidences of Spina Bifida in their biological children. The Agent Orange Benefits Act (Public Law 104-204), which became law in 1996, established a benefits package for the children of Vietnam veterans as a result of exposure of one or both biological parents to herbicide during active duty in the Vietnam war. These benefits include lifetime health care services for Spina Bifida and any disability associated with Spina Bifida, a monthly monetary allowance, and VA vocational training and rehabilitation service. The Act authorized the VA to provide such benefits effective October 1, 1997, but not earlier than the date of the VA's receipt of an individual's claim for benefits. Regrettably however, this legislation did not tackle the already incurred medical costs directly correlated to Spina Bifida. According to the VA, there are approximately 1,200 affected children of Vietnam-era veterans receiving compensation since enactment of the Agent Orange Benefits Act. While these children became eligible for benefits in 1997, these veterans and their families have been left with the cost of years of medical care necessary to treat a child's condition since birth that was directly attributable to the veteran's wartime service. The Agent Orange Reconciliation Act of 2016 would make the benefits for children of Vietnam-era veterans born with and currently suffering from Spina Bifida effective beginning at birth. As a result, this bill would provide a one-time retroactive monetary payment to the families enduring this condition to compensate for treatment of the symptoms of Spina Bifida from birth until enactment of the Agent Orange Benefits Act. Let us provide the benefits for which we are responsible with this important legislation. Our provision of benefits to the children of Vietnam veterans living suffering from Spina Bifida from their birth not only honors the service of these veterans but also recognizes the harmful and continued effects of Agent Orange Exposure in later generations. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 77 (Monday, May 16, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E711] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE AGENT ORANGE RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2016 ______ HON.
