Glen was a medical pioneer whose work has transformed the lives of many thousands and thousands of people. From performing surgeries to creating medical devices to leading several healthcare companies, Glen did it all. Health care was his career, and that is because he recognized the power of medicine and innovation and how it could be used to make a difference in the lives of his neighbors. Glen put it best when he said: ``As a surgeon, you save one life at a time, but with medical devices, you know you are saving so many more.'' Glen did what he did not to make money or gain fame.

There are Members of this Congress who want to burden the entire country with Florida's shamefully weak gun laws in a race to the bottom for gun permit standards. Even the current reciprocity agreements between States are strained by how easy Florida makes it to get a permit.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the further consideration of H.R. 4974, and that I may include tabular material on the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaMalfa). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 736 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 4974. Will the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) kindly resume the chair. {time} 0914 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 4974) making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, with Mr. Collins of Georgia in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson) had been disposed of and the bill had been read through page 71, line 6. {time} 0915 Amendment Offered by Mr. Heck of Washington Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. Upon the acceptance by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of the newly constructed holes 10 through 18 at the golf course at American Lake Veterans Hospital on a portion of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, which were designed by Jack Nicklaus on a pro bono basis, the holes shall be designated as the ``Nicklaus Nine''. Mr. HECK of Washington (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered read. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved. The Clerk will continue to read. The Clerk continued to read. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Washington and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington. Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I actually plan on withdrawing my amendment, but would like to make my colleagues aware of some amazing work being done in my district on behalf of veterans and wounded warriors. Mr. Chairman, millions--millions--of people watched the U.S. Open at Chambers Bay in Washington's 10th Congressional District last June. It showcased, frankly, the irreplaceable beauty of golf in the Pacific Northwest. But just a 10-minute drive from Chambers Bay, you will also find yourself at beautiful American Lake. At American Lake, that is where veterans recover and heal from injuries at the VA facility, which is located near Joint Base Lewis- McChord. A big part of that recuperation includes a bit of TLC from another golf course in addition to Chambers Bay. Since 1955, 61 years, nine holes of golf at the American Lake Veterans Golf Course is where South Sound veterans could escape the stresses of their daily lives and engage in some healthy competition. And let's be honest, it is hard to look forward to a visit to the doctor, but looking forward to a round of golf with your buddies is something entirely different. It has become a great way for older vets to connect with younger vets for more recent conflicts. Currently, American Lake Veterans Golf Course--it is important that you hear this--is the Nation's only golf course designed specifically for the rehabilitation of wounded and disabled veterans. Almost all of the dedicated volunteers there are veterans as well. Well, except one, and his name is Jack Nicklaus--yes, that Jack Nicklaus--the ``Golden Bear,'' widely regarded, perhaps, as the greatest golfer of our time, who now spends his time actually designing golf courses. He is the one who helped design and expand the American Lake Veterans Golf Course to include a back nine. They went from nine holes to 18. The back nine is now in place, and the course is waiting for VA Secretary McDonald to sign the necessary paperwork to formally accept the course improvements. The course exists because of the determination of hardworking volunteers--really angels among us. And now it is time to honor one of those committed volunteers for his commitment to our veterans and wounded warriors, and officially designate holes 10 through 18 as the Nicklaus Nine. With the Nicklaus Nine, we will now have an 18-hole, 100 percent ADA accessible golf course to accommodate returning troops and our local combat veterans. With the Nicklaus Nine, we will have double the accessibility and green to offer our veterans who have given so much to all of us. Now, I am going to tell you a story, and I guarantee it is going to stay with you, I guarantee that you are going to remember this story. There is a program at American Lake Veterans Golf Course that teaches blind veterans how to play golf. One year, we had a local golfer--his name happens to be Ray Reed--who was sent to the National Blind Golf Tournament in Iowa. Ray Reed, blind, wounded warrior. And do you know what he did at that national golf tournament? He scored a hole in one. Yes, blind veterans can golf, and they learn how to do that at American Lake. It is incredible. They are an inspiration to all of us. Mr. Chairman, to avoid a point of order on my amendment, I would like to withdraw it at this time. But I hope that I can work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find another vehicle, or a standalone bill, to get this done. I strongly believe it to be appropriate to honor and bestow on he who has changed the name of golf, the Golden Bear, this honor for changing the lives of wounded warriors. I hope this will encourage the design and development of more golf courses around the U.S. devoted to our veterans and our wounded warriors. With that, Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleagues. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. The CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gibson Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available for this Act may be used by the Department of Veterans Affairs to preclude the territorial seas of the Republic of Vietnam from inclusion in the meaning of the Republic of Vietnam under the Agent Orange Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-4) and the amendments made by that Act. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved. Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chair, I am here this morning to bring forward an amendment that is for our sailors who fought in the Vietnam war. This is about ensuring they get the health care and the benefits that they have earned through their service in Vietnam. But in a broader sense, this is really about justice. This is about veterans who went forward and fought that war, a deeply unpopular war that divided our Nation. They were never asked [[Page H2850]] about their political leanings or what their views were on the war. They simply did what they were ordered to do. They went forward and they gave their very best effort to serve us. In the process of that war, we used Agent Orange to defoliate. In the case of these sailors, serving just offshore in Vietnam, we had ships that were involved in resupply operations at the ports and at the harbor, and they were vulnerable. They were vulnerable because there was vegetation near the ports and the harbors. As our countermeasure to that, we defoliated to give standoff for those ships to protect them. But what we have learned over time, Mr. Chairman, is that that was poisoning our sailors, and anyone that was in close proximity. Now, and in fact in 1991, this body, along with the Senate and the President of the United States of America, enacted a law, the Agent Orange Act of 1991, that ensured that our veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange had access to the health care and the benefits that they had earned. Regrettably, in 2002, executive overreach led to a rule that narrowed the interpretation of our law. Now it is so that you have to have served on the ground in Vietnam or in the Riverine Navy to get access to this law and to these benefits. Mr. Chairman, the people's representatives never spoke on that. This is an issue we have dealt with time and again in this Chamber, both sides of the aisle, fighting back, fighting for our article I prerogatives. And this is very clear here. This body spoke. We said we had to try to make right what was wrong. So now we have about 90,000 sailors that don't have access to health care. Mr. Chairman, be advised and be assured that Members of this body fight every day for these veterans in a case-by-case basis, and we do win some of these, but we don't win all of them. It is just flatly wrong. Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does is really ensure that our article I prerogatives are secured. That we go back to the original language that we passed and the President signed. I would ask all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Point of Order Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I make a point of order against this amendment. Although it is a very well-intended amendment, and I am very sympathetic to what he wants to do, I think there might be a way, if the gentleman withdraws and tries to perfect that amendment, that it might be made in order. This amendment proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI. The rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.'' The bill gives direction to that effect. I ask for a ruling from the Chair. Again, I would ask my colleague to consider withdrawing and see if he can perfect that amendment so that it would be made in order. The CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say, I have the deepest respect for the chairman, a dear colleague and friend. But I have to say that I am astounded that we would talk about a point of order here when we are talking about our language. This is what we passed. What we saw is that the executive branch, with fiat, changed what it is that we passed. So I don't know how it is that we are legislating to their executive overreach. This is merely an amendment that goes back to our language. And it is not just me standing here today; 320 of our colleagues in the United States House of Representatives, on both sides of the aisle, believe that this needs to get done. And nearly half of the Senate, an exact companion, also believe that. Now, because of our friendship and because of the way that we have worked together, I just want to enter into a colloquy and get clarification from the chairman. What I think I heard him say moments ago is that, if I withdraw, he will work with us so that we can reassert our Article I powers and ensure that we have justice for these Vietnam veterans who deserve these benefits. Can I get that clarification from the chairman? The CHAIR. The Chair will hear each Member individually on the point of order. A point of order is pending. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized to be heard on the point of order. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, on the point of order, the point I am trying to make is this: if the amendment is withdrawn, it can be reworked so that it would be in order. We believe that there is a way to do that even today. That is the offer I am making to you. If the amendment is withdrawn, there is a possibility that this amendment could be made in order, but it does have to be perfected. I am a cosponsor of the actual underlying legislation, so I support it. But at the moment, in our view, it does constitute legislation in an appropriation bill, and, therefore, it violates clause 2 of rule XXI. But I pledge to work to the best of our ability to try to make it in order, even today, if possible. The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized. Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chair, given the pledge of my dear friend from Pennsylvania to work to make sure that we have justice and that we can move forward and help these veterans, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. The CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used for the Veterans Experience Office. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a simple amendment to prevent wasteful new administrative spending within the VA General Administration Account, and to ensure that scarce resources are not diverted away from the priorities that need them most. My amendment will strengthen and support the position of this committee to ensure that none of the funds made available by this act may be used by the administration's proposed bureaucracy quagmire called the Veterans Experience Office. While the name may make this proposed new nationwide office sound like a good idea, this proposal would unleash a new cadre of Federal bureaucrats to stand between the veterans and their benefits, repeating those terrifying nine words, ``I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'' We all share the goal of improving each and every veteran's experience with the VA. However, it would be foolish to permit the creation of a new general administration program that would siphon off more than $72 million away from the programs and offices prioritized by this committee as those most in need of support. I commend the committee for identifying this wasteful proposal in their report, stating, ``While the committee supports the Secretary's efforts to improve the ways VA interacts with veterans, it has doubts about the wisdom of establishing a large new office with regional staffing at this late date in the administration.'' While the position of the committee is clear, my amendment is necessary to ensure that the administration is prohibited from transferring limited funds within the general administration account to fund this unwise and duplicitous proposal. This administration is notorious for ignoring the will [[Page H2851]] of Congress and seeking out loopholes to advance the executive branch's agenda. This track record of rogue behavior is why this amendment is so necessary in order to carry out the committee's recommendation and properly care for our veterans. The VA doesn't need more money to hire more people pushers to create an even larger bureaucracy between the veterans and their benefits. Instead, let's ensure resources are allocated where they have the most effective and efficient benefit for those who have given their country so much. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. I thank Chairman Dent and Ranking Member Bishop for their time. I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 0930 Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I understand the gentleman's concerns about starting this large, new office at the VA. As you can see from our report, we cut the request for General Administration by $81.3 million, largely because of our concerns about funding this large office; so I think we have already achieved what the gentleman is looking to accomplish. It is hard to imagine that the VA could find $81 million in another account to backfill this office. I will not oppose the gentleman's amendment. I will tell the gentleman, however, that this will inevitably become a conference issue because the Senate supports the creation of the office. I do not object to the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, the bulk of the request of the increase for the General Administration was intended for the establishment of the Veterans Experience Office. Up until now, the Veterans Experience Office's activities have been funded through the Office of Enterprise Integration. However, the FY 2017 budget proposes to make the Veterans Experience Office a standalone office within the General Administration and requests $72.6 million in funding and 204 full-time equivalents via direct budget authority. While we all support the Secretary's efforts to improve the way the VA interacts with the veterans, we had doubts about the wisdom of establishing a large, new office with regional staffing at this late date in the administration. It was decided not to include this funding. However, there is nothing in the bill that prevents the Secretary from continuing to fund the office in the way that he did in the previous fiscal year. Conversely, the amendment before us will prevent this office from being funded, period. I believe that the amendment is a bridge too far. While I don't support making the Veterans Experience Office a free- standing office, I also don't support taking the Secretary's flexibility away either. I believe that the bill is the right approach. I urge Members to oppose the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I rebut. This President and his agencies have shown time and time again that they are eager to ignore the will of Congress and to implement his agenda wherever they can. This is a necessary reminder that the VA is hardly a vestibule of good behavior. I think we need to make them concentrate on doing their procedures right that they currently cannot do right. I urge Members to accept my amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to-- (1) carry out the memorandum from the Veterans Benefit Administration known as Fast Letter 13-10, issued on May 20, 2013; or (2) create or maintain any patient record-keeping system other than those currently approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office in Washington, D.C. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I offer an amendment. I have offered similar amendments in the last 2 years, and they have passed each time. I had hoped that it would not be necessary to offer this amendment again this year. Unfortunately, an investigation from the Government Accountability Office that was released last month found that the VA schedulers are still manipulating appointment wait times and are underestimating how long veterans have to wait to get care at a VA facility. The GAO's most recent audit found that schedulers changed dates and shortened wait times for 15 to 20 percent of the cases reviewed. To make matters worse, USA Today recently claimed to have studied more than 70 investigative reports, and it found that these manipulations were being performed at the behest of the VA supervisors. Last year, a different inspector general investigation uncovered an actual memo from the VA leadership that encouraged this type of behavior. The memo I speak of is known as the Fast Letter 13-10, and it was handed down directly from the Office of the Director of the Veterans Benefits Administration to the Philadelphia VA Regional Benefit Office. I was appalled--but not totally surprised--to learn of this memo. The need for my amendment first surfaced 2 years ago as a response to explosive allegations about the Phoenix VA's keeping secondary, unofficial records of claims and appointment requests. My commonsense amendment simply prohibits the VA from keeping unofficial recordkeeping systems and manipulating wait times. I have said this before, but it is sad that we have to pass amendments to prevent this type of behavior. When government bureaucrats don't use good judgment or common sense, Congress must address these issues. We must have one consistent patient recordkeeping system within the VA in order to provide accountability, uniformity, and to prevent employee manipulation. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank Chairman Dent and Ranking Member Bishop for their time. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, this amendment is familiar to us since the gentleman offered it last year. I am not sure it is necessary to repeat the language this year since we know the VA has rescinded the Fast Letter guidance. After all, with the IG investigation into the dual scheduling systems, it doesn't seem likely that the VA is maintaining recordkeeping systems that are not approved by headquarters; but I am not going to object to the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Chair, we want to reward good behavior, and until they illustrate good behavior, the amendment is going forward. I appreciate the chairman's support. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Mica Mr. MICA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. (a) For an additional amount for ``Veterans Health Administration--Medical Services'' for grants to States under subchapter III of chapter 81 of title 38, United States Code, to expand, remodel, or alter existing buildings for furnishing nursing home [[Page H2852]] care to veterans in State homes that are former nursing home facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, as authorized by section 8133 of such subchapter, there is hereby appropriated, and the amount otherwise provided by this Act for ``Departmental Administration--General Administration'' is hereby reduced by, $10,000,000. (b) None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce the prioritization requirements in paragraphs (1)(C) or (2) through (5) of section 8135(c) of title 38, United States Code, with respect to the appropriation in subsection (a). The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. MICA. Mr. Chair, this is a simple amendment. I get to chair a subcommittee called Transportation and Public Assets. We get to oversee, in the public assets portion, all of the various properties around the United States that are public assets that are sitting idle. For example, in some States we have many VA properties that are medical--some hospitals, some nursing homes--that are sitting idle. Some of them are vacant, and some of them are closed. In order to put them into productive use for our veterans, I have tried to craft an amendment that, of course, doesn't apply to all of the facilities. I would like to do that, but this is fairly limited. It says that we have a nursing home that has been vacated or a nursing home that is not being used, and some of them, for several years, have sat vacant. This allows the Secretary discretion, and it also sets aside a small number of funds to help bring that property into a condition so that it can be transferred to the State. You have these in Pennsylvania, Mr. Chair. You have these across the Rust Belt. We have them even in Florida. What we don't have is the authority for the VA to move forward with these properties in their transferring and get the properties into condition and make the little bits of changes in the properties to transfer them to the States. This will apply to 49 States. There are 49 States that have State VAs. Many of them run nursing homes. In my State, for example, we run seven nursing homes now. We do it more cost-effectively. We can do it faster. We can take those idle assets and put them into use. In some places in the Rust Belt, you need to consolidate some of the facilities, and this will allow us to do that, too, and to run them cheaper and give better services to our veterans, not spread out the limited number of even staffers whom we have and administrators. Think of what you can save just on that. This is an amendment to try to move that process forward. We are not trying to get ahead of anybody who is in line for any kind of a VA facility. What we are trying to do is, again, tell the VA Secretary that he can move forward and put a little bit of money aside that will make a big, big difference with these facilities that are sitting vacant or half empty across the country, and it does apply to 49 States. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I understand there is a great demand throughout our Nation for State veterans' homes, and I wish we had the allocation to provide more for this program than we did. I do want to raise a concern with the language that it might--I say ``might.'' I am not saying ``definitely''--favor some States rather than increase funding for the entire State HOME Program. I was pleased to hear the gentleman state that he is not trying to jump ahead of other States that may be in line, but this is an issue that we are going to have to discuss at the conference committee. I am not going to object to the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MICA. I appreciate that. Mr. Chair, I think if there are differences in language, we have tried to work with the parliamentarian and the committee, and I know you all are busy in trying to get a very important piece of legislation out, but this small amendment can make a big difference. Again, this is in Rust Belt States, even in growing States like Florida, and there is no more cost to the Federal taxpayer in the operation. In fact, we will save money in the operation because the States take these over. And if the States take them over, it is one less burden on the VA. We have seen how difficult it is sometimes to get services from the VA, to have these facilities come on line. To the nursing home folks, listen to this. This is to nursing homes: we have a tremendously expanding, aging veterans' population, and we can't keep up with it all, and the Federal Government sometimes does it the least efficiently. This allows us to take those empty or half empty or partially used facilities and get them to the States, to sometimes consolidate the operations and save money on administration, operation, and expedite and get that service to our veterans as soon as possible. I urge the Members' support of this small amendment. I will be glad to work with the chairman, with the ranking member, and with others and craft this in any way that they feel comfortable, but the objective is very important at this stage. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used in contravention of sections 575.106 or 575.206 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, in a 2015 report from the VA Office of the Inspector General, it was discovered and reported that two senior staff members used their positions of power to financially and personally benefit from unethical behavior. Diana Rubens and Kimberly Graves not only coerced two VA managers to leave their positions against their will, they then manufactured circumstances that allowed for them to take the positions in question. To make matters worse, these women then took advantage of the VA's relocation expense program. Relocation bonuses may be given to current employees if an open position will be difficult to fill without such an incentive. In both of these instances, this clearly was not the case. In total, these women walked away with more than $400,000 in taxpayer funds. As if these actions weren't heinous enough, when the VA did attempt to hold Rubens and Graves accountable, the VA was subsequently overturned because they failed to discipline the other employees involved in this case. I am appalled--but ultimately, again, not surprised--to hear of this story. The VA has been riddled with scandal and plagued with lawlessness for years now. Chairman Miller said it best in the days that followed the reversal of the VA's decision, stating: ``Every objective observer knows that the Federal civil service system coddles and protects misbehaving employees instead of facilitating fair and efficient discipline; and until VA and Obama administration leaders acknowledge this problem and work with Congress to solve it, it will never be fixed.'' Mr. Chair, my amendment is a commonsense approach that simply reaffirms the requirements in the Code of Federal Regulations for employment incentives and relocation expenses. {time} 0945 Had the VA followed these regulations, Diana Rubens and Kimberly Graves wouldn't have been able to force two managers to leave and then get reimbursed for moving across the country to take their spots. I have said this before, but it is sad that we have to pass amendments to [[Page H2853]] prevent this type of behavior. When government bureaucrats fail to serve the American people through the use of common sense, Congress must address these issues personally. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their help. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time to speak in opposition, but I am not opposed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, no one shares the gentleman's concerns more than I do about the inappropriate relocation incentive payments the VA initially paid to two executives at the Philadelphia regional office. The VA has since reformed its policies, and I hope we will never ever hear again about such egregious staff misconduct and inappropriate reimbursements. However, I do think that the relocation incentive can be an important tool in some circumstances. Although I have no objection to the gentleman's amendment, I think this may need to be refined a bit in conference to reflect the usefulness of the tool, when used appropriately. As I said, there was egregious misconduct in Philadelphia, as the gentleman correctly points out. There is no question. In fact, many of us went and visited the Philadelphia regional office at about that time for a hearing, both Republicans and Democrats, authorizers and appropriators, to discuss the challenges at that particular office. That said, I have no objection to the amendment. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. DENT. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I have the deepest respect for the gentleman from Pennsylvania and for the gentleman who is offering the amendment, but I think that we may be just going a little bit too far here. Mr. Chair, this amendment will restrict the ability of the VA and the departments and related agencies funded in this act to use incentives to get experienced, talented, and capable individuals to take on difficult-to-fill positions. In other departments, they call these hardship posts. These are the jobs no one wants to do but are vital to the function of government. I think we can all agree that there are times when we need to provide incentives to those individuals whom we are asking to fill difficult jobs. At times, we need to take action to make a job more appealing, and sometimes we need to provide incentives to compete with the salaries that are typically paid outside of the Federal Government for some of the positions. I am concerned that this amendment will decrease the availability and quality of candidates possessing the competencies that are required for filling the hard-to-fill posts. We would not run a Fortune 500 company this way. Why are we limiting the ability of the U.S. Government to recruit and hire the best and the brightest? I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, trust is a series of promises kept, and it is very notable that the VA has lost the trust of Congress and the American people and, more importantly, our veterans. So until we get this right, until they can actually earn the respect and do the due diligence that they are expected to do for our veterans, it is a requirement of us to make sure, like a dog on a bone, to hold them accountable. I hope that everybody will vote for this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce the exception in clause (iii) of section 1.218(a)(8) of title 38, Code of Federal Regulations. Mr. GOSAR (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered as read. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona? There was no objection. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, recently, a veteran receiving care from the VA contacted my office to express his concern about pro-union fliers being posted in VA facilities. The veteran sent me a picture of one of these fliers, shown here for your reference. Right here. As you can see, this flier is an attempt to recruit union activists. Another flier, just above it, praises the agenda at the AFL-CIO. The veteran who contacted me was appalled that he was barraged by these pro-union advertisements during his visits to the VA. I couldn't agree more. Our Nation's heros should not be subjected to blatantly partisan advertisements while trying to receive medical care at VA facilities. My staff investigated this issue and found that, while solicitations like these are prohibited by law, union lobbyists were able to carve out a special exemption that allowed solicitation of labor organization membership or dues in VA facilities. This is a blatant abuse of taxpayer-funded facilities for the purpose of pushing a pro-union agenda. Given the obvious political nature of these groups, they should not be allowed to advertise in the VA facilities. Furthermore, the fact that VA employees are engaging in union activities while on the clock is unacceptable, given the current state of the VA. Any time these employees spend time doing union activities is time they cannot spend treating our veterans. With a massive backlog of cases and the fact that veterans have literally died waiting for care, this abuse of taxpayer money and our veterans must be put to an end. For that reason, I introduced the amendment currently at the desk. My amendment will prohibit the use of funds to implement, administer, or enforce the current union loophole. Defunding this exemption that allows unions to solicit members and dues at VA facilities would place unions under the same regulatory framework as other 501(c)'s. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, this is just another attack on organized labor and working people. The conduct that the gentleman wishes to prohibit is consistent with the National Labor Relations Act, and it is consistent with the traditions of this country. It is freedom of speech, and I think it ought to be allowed. I certainly object to this. I think that the working people ought to have an opportunity to express themselves and utilize fully the First Amendment, even in our VA facilities. I couldn't imagine that people who support the Constitution would want to muzzle working people and limit their ability to seek associations with like-minded people. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, once again, my amendment is critical to ensuring that our veterans receive the care they deserve in a nonpoliticized environment. Again, this amendment idea came from a veteran who was outraged about the VA being littered with union recruitment fliers. No veteran should be forced to endure blatantly partisan union advertisements in a taxpayer-funded building in order to receive the medical care they earned defending our country. We should all agree that the VA employees should be spending their taxpayer-funded time treating veterans, not posting union fliers and negotiating for higher wages, especially given the VA claims and the backlog of appeals that exist. I encourage adoption of the amendment. [[Page H2854]] I also want to make sure that people understand that this amendment would create that the unions be treated as any other 501(c). I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, well, once again, we want to make sure that everybody is treated fairly about this. As you can see, the blatant attempt here about recruitment to the unions within our VA is outright disgusting. We want to make sure that everybody is treated fairly and has the opportunity for fair speech, but this gives a hand up to the unions. I ask all my colleagues to vote for this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, again, this is another nasty rider. This is a rider that is totally unnecessary and inappropriate on this bill. It violates the Constitution. It certainly limits the rights of people in veterans facilities to be able to have freedom of speech and freedom of association. It is a bad proposition. I urge my colleagues to oppose it. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. Amendment Offered by Mr. Perry Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill, before the short title, add the following new section: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement or enforce Executive Order 13502. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, in 2009, the President issued Executive Order 13502, which strongly encourages Federal agencies to require project labor agreements, or PLAs, on Federal construction projects exceeding $25 million in cost. This amendment simply states, as already read, that none of the funds made available by this act may be used to implement or enforce this executive order. Now, project labor agreements, Mr. Chair, discourage what is called a merit shop contractor from bidding on taxpayer-funded construction contracts. Let me be clear. That means, if you don't have a union, you can't even bid. By the way, the vast majority of all work conducted in the United States, private or government, is conducted by nonunion contractors. It is not meant to disparage unions. It is just saying that there should be open competition for everybody. Because it is a limited competition, it actually drives up the cost that each of us pay for the construction, somewhere between 12 and 18 percent, needlessly. Even if it is only 12 percent, why pay it? It results in fewer infrastructure improvements simply because there is just not as much money because we are paying more for the ones that we are doing. It is a project-specific collective bargaining agreement with multiple unions that is unique only to the construction industry. It is done nowhere else, only in the construction industry. Now, the NLRA permits construction employees to execute a PLA, a project labor agreement, voluntarily. When the PLA is mandated by a government agency, construction contracts can be awarded only to contracts and subcontractors that agree to the terms and conditions of the PLA, essentially making them a union organization. Typically, the contractors have to recognize the union as the representative of their employees. No longer is the private business the representative, but only the union is the representative, and they have to hire from the union hall. Furthermore, if you ever pay prevailing wage or the Federal minimum wage for these kinds of projects, there is a thing called the fringe benefits, which includes your medical, your dental, your retirement. Those all will be put into union-managed benefits and pension programs. So even if you are a private employer that is not unionized, all that money, all those fringe benefits go to those programs. You must obey the restrictive and sometimes inefficient rules of job classification. So, for instance, if you are an electrician, you might want to wire something up, but if you need some conduit, you can't go get it because you are not a laborer. You are an electrician, and you have to wait for the laborer to go get it. That doesn't happen in nonunion environments. It is just inefficient. Furthermore, PLAs force employees to pay union dues, whether they are in the union or not, and then accept unwanted union representation. They also forfeit the benefits earned during the life of the project unless they join the union and become vested in union benefit plans. So they lose all that. Quite honestly, it is just simply a union recruiting plan at taxpayer expense. I don't have problems with the union; I just don't think that we should be paying for them. The PLA requirements and preferences on taxpayer-funded contracts expose procurement officials to intense political pressure because they are not negotiating normally. It is negotiated under the terms of the project labor agreement, not just a regular contract where you agree to do so much work and we would agree to pay so much. You agree to do it at this time, and we agree to accept that timeframe. It disrupts local collective bargaining agreements already in place because it is contract specific for the project at the time. Obviously, because of that, it stifles competition. {time} 1000 You stifle competition, it raises the cost. Who is paying the extra cost? The American taxpayer. It creates, or potentially creates, contracting and construction delays. We don't need any more delays at the VA. I think we have been through that plenty of times. Now, we just want to get the best price. We want everybody involved. We want everybody able to bid and able to participate. Let the government, let the taxpayer get the best job for the best price. Under this amendment, PLAs for military construction would not be forbidden. They are still not forbidden; they are just not mandated. Again, this amendment simply allows none of the funds made by the executive order to be used to implement or enforce Executive Order 13502. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The DOD does a lot of construction projects--this bill is certainly a testament to that--and these are often complex projects. They build facilities that are used to repair ships or store munitions, and usually when we read about large, complex construction projects, it is often in the context of delays or cost overruns or concerns on the workforce front. Folks want to see local opportunities on local projects. Now, a project labor agreement allows Federal agencies to negotiate exclusively with the building trades to ensure both union and open shop contractors are able to participate on the project. The agreement establishes quality worksite conditions and works to ensure construction is finished on time and under budget. When executed properly, PLAs are flexible, and they encourage participation from a wide variety of prime and subcontractors. In fact, PLAs are used on big, private projects. Look at every significant hotel project, casino project, stadium project. I worked professionally in economic development before I came here. These project labor agreements were vital to seeing projects happen. Why? Because they save money and because they keep projects on schedule and because they use local workers. You have seen the first project labor agreement in Navy history in my district--just one, mind you. What is the [[Page H2855]] outcome? Well, the project is going to be completed at a cost of $250 million below what was originally projected. With a contract that was worked out ahead of time, it meant that local workers were assigned on the front end. They brought in quality workers, local workers, and that strengthens our local communities. By partnering with local trades and using apprenticeship programs, this is helping to grow the next generation of tradespeople, giving opportunities to veterans and to women and minority communities. So it means that we are not just building a wharf in my district; it means we are building the next generation of workers. We are building the middle class. When you compare this with similar large, complex projects, the project that we just had with a project labor agreement had fewer problems and will deliver more value for taxpayers. So I do not understand why we would take this valuable tool out of our toolbox. We should be encouraging these efforts. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I just want to state I have no objection to the gentleman's amendment. The Department of Defense has awarded one construction contract, that is the explosives-handling wharf in Kitsap, Washington--I believe, in the gentleman's district--where the solicitation favored PLAs. The Department of Veterans Affairs has not awarded any contracts that have used PLAs, and they currently have no solicitations that favor PLAs. That said, I am very sympathetic with the gentleman's amendment, and I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I am very disappointed that, instead of seeking to pass the most bipartisan bill possible, my colleagues would prefer to weigh down the bill that funds veterans and military construction with a divisive rider. PLAs can be an essential tool to allow large projects to be completed on time and on budget. They are a benefit to both employers and employees. A project labor agreement provides a single collective bargaining unit, which allows for easier management of a project. They provide a reliable and uninterrupted supply of workers. They provide uniform wages, uniform benefits, overtime pay. A PLA sets the terms and conditions of employment for all workers onsite, including the work conditions and the rules. In addition, a PLA prohibits strikes and work stoppages. It is insulting that some would seek to prevent the use of PLAs on this bill when it is one of the best tools available to guarantee that veterans are hired as skilled construction workers. The use of a PLA does not prevent nonunion small businesses from participating. They have to agree to the terms and to sign on to the PLA. In addition, the PLA does not make the project union only. Simply put, project labor agreements help both the government and the private sector increase the efficiency and the quality of its project by promoting a business model that employs a highly skilled workforce. Such a workforce ensures that construction projects are built correctly the first time, on time and, as a result, on budget. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. I would note that this House has repeatedly refused to adopt similar amendments on this bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 30 seconds remaining. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate that this does not take this tool out of the toolbox. It just doesn't require it. With all due respect to those who say, well, it stops strikes from happening and it makes sure it is on time and on budget, a simple contract that millions of Americans sign every single day without a project labor agreement does that already. If project labor agreements are necessary, why aren't we all doing it with the work on our homes or the work on our businesses? The fact is it is not done everywhere because it is not necessary. The fact is it discourages participation, because you can participate if you want to join the union, or at least de facto join the union because you are going to do everything by the union code, every single thing, all your employees, all your representation. I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross). Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, let's start out by talking about some of the facts, because I hear some talking points from those who are trying to disturb and remove all workers' rights. There is nothing that currently is in place that mandates project labor agreements be used. If so, we would have thousands and thousands of them. It makes them permissible when a large and complex job would benefit from a precontract agreement, because that is what we are talking about. We are not talking about building a house or renovating a bedroom. Large, complex projects, that is what we are talking about. All it talks about is, before you sign a contract, make sure that you spell out very specifically the issues that could come up germane to that job. I have negotiated in my past life over 100 of these. Why? Because employers understand that this is to their benefit. There is a better cost ratio balance when they do a project labor agreement. They are public jobs, they are private jobs where nobody is mandating everything or anything. What we are saying here is that entering into a project labor agreement does one very important thing that nobody quite remembers here: Helmets to Hardhats, taking our veterans who served our country, giving them an opportunity to come home, put their uniform away, and go to work on a construction project. That alone is worth its weight in gold, and that is what Helmets to Hardhats does under a project labor agreement. It creates and allows that next generation of construction workers, those skilled craftsmen, to be part of that. Not one dime of that apprenticeship program comes from the government. This works. Why does it work? Because it saves money. The employer likes it because there are less headaches on the job, and it is probably the most important tool that could be in that worker's toolbox, to make sure that they level the playing field for a quality job that comes in on time and under budget. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be postponed. Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in contravention of subchapter III of chapter 20 of title 38, United States Code. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentlewoman from Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer the Jackson Lee amendment that clearly recognizes the importance of those who have served and [[Page H2856]] their lives after. My amendment says none of the funds made available by this act for the Department of Veterans Affairs may be used in contravention of subchapter III of chapter 20 of title 38 of the U.S. Code, which refers to the benefits for homeless veterans in training and outreach programs. Texas and Florida and California happen to be some of the States that have the highest number of homeless veterans. These are individuals who put on the uniform unselfishly. Now they are homeless for a variety of reasons. I hope that this amendment will reinforce and reemphasize the importance of ensuring that the rate of homelessness among veterans in the United States does not increase. As well, my amendment will remind us of our obligation to provide our veterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which includes adequate funding for programs like the Veterans Administration Supportive Housing that provides case management services, adequate housing facilities, mental health support, and addresses other issues that contribute to veterans' homelessness. I have, on my staff, a wounded warrior. We work a lot with homeless veterans. We visit their centers. We provide them with a sense that their commitment to this Nation will never be forgotten. Today in our country there are approximately 107,000 veterans, male and female, who are homeless on any given night, and perhaps twice as many, 200,000, experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year. I remember dealing with one of my nonprofits that was renting a space just to help three or four or five veterans. Unfortunately, the landlord was not sensitive to the fact that he did not have all the moneys to pay his rent. He was ultimately evicted. But it wasn't just he who was evicted, who was trying to be the Good Samaritan, it was veterans who called that place home. Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because of their poverty and lack of support from their family. In my hometown of Houston, for example, we have had large numbers of homeless veterans, but we have begun to work on it. I hope that this amendment will remind people of supportive service programs, residential rehabilitation programs, and HUD VA programs. I ask support of my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I do not oppose the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman has offered the amendment in previous years, and we have accepted it. I have no objection to it being included again in the bill this year. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the distinguished ranking member and a strong supporter of veterans and leadership on the MILCON bill. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I just want to let my voice be heard to congratulate the gentlewoman on her amendment. It has been adopted previously by this House. I think it is a great amendment. We support our homeless veterans. I congratulate the gentlewoman for offering the amendment. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, let me thank Mr. Dent and Mr. Bishop for their leadership, and certainly the appropriators, the full committee chairman and ranking member, on the tasks that they have before them. We are not going to end homelessness for veterans if we do not invest in programs that will help them. My amendment is to ensure that we are reminded that these veterans can be rehabilitated and can be provided a new pathway in life. It is simply a continuing way to say thank you. Whenever I speak before veterans, whenever I speak before the United States military, I remind them--though they do not need to be reminded--that they unselfishly put on the uniform without question. They put on the uniform without question, and they followed orders. They followed the orders of the Commander in Chief. So now I hope that we, as Members of Congress, will follow orders and increase investment in the HUD-VASH program allocated to communities with the highest numbers of homeless veterans, support all council agencies to promote and give incentives to local coordination or plans and have our local communities own these plans so that they will bring down the cost of homelessness or the size of homelessness to prevent or to provide, if you will, for the homeownership that is so very important that our veterans desire. {time} 1015 But the most important point is, why don't we stand and salute and stand at attention and say to our veterans: we hear you. Homelessness must not exist among our veterans. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. It reminds us of funding for veterans who are homeless, as well as for programs for veterans who are homeless. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. It is Jackson Lee Amendment No. 350. Thank you for this opportunity to describe my amendment, which simply provides that: ``None of the funds made available by this Act for the Department of Veteran Affairs--Benefits for Homeless Veterans and Training and Outreach Programs may be used in contravention of the title 38, Part II, Chapter 20, Subchapter II and III of the U.S. Code This amendment will help ensure that the rate of homelessness among veterans in the United States does not increase. I thank Subcommittee Chairman Dent and Ranking Member Bishop for their hard work in shepherding this important legislation to the floor. I offer the Jackson Lee Amendment because I believe reducing and eliminating homelessness among veterans, those who risked their lives to protect our freedom, should also be one of the nation's highest priorities. Homelessness among the American veteran population is on the rise in the United States and we must be proactive in giving back to those who have given so much to us. My amendment will help remind us of our obligation to provide our veterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which includes adequately funding for programs Veterans Administration Supportive Housing (VASH) that provide case-management services, adequate housing facilities, mental health support, and address other areas that contribute to veteran homelessness. VASH is a jointly-administered permanent supportive housing program for disabled Veterans experiencing homelessness in which VA medical Centers provide referrals and case management while Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) administer the Section 8 housing vouchers. Mr. Chair, our veterans deserve the best services available, and I believe that we could be doing much more for them. Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male and female) who are homeless on any given night. And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year. Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because of their poverty, lack of support from family and friends, and dismal living conditions in cheap hotels or in overcrowded or substandard housing. While significant progress has been made, ending homelessness among veterans remains a big challenge. In my hometown of Houston for example, between the years 2010 and 2012, the number of homeless veterans increased from 771 to 1,162. We must remain vigilant and continue to fight for those who put on the uniform and fought for us. Providing a home for veterans to come home to every night is the very least we can do. Mr. Chair, programs like VASH have succeeded in changing lives. In 2012 alone, 35,905 veterans lived in the public housing provided by VASH. I have seen the impact of such grants in my home state of Texas, and within my congressional district in Houston, and I am sure that this funding has positively impacted many communities across this country. In Texas, there are committed groups in Houston, working to eradicate the issue of homelessness. [[Page H2857]] For example, the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center has been involved in changing veterans' lives in a mighty way by providing Veterans and their families with access to affordable housing and medical services that will help them get back on their feet. Mr. Chair, we cannot let this issue of homelessness continue. I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee Amendment and commit ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran homelessness in America. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gibson Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to enforce VA Adjudication Procedure Manual M21-1, Part IV, Subpart ii, Chapter 1, Section H, Topic 28.h related to Developing Claims Based on Service Aboard Ships Offshore the RVN. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the Parliamentarian and the chairman and the ranking member. Earlier this morning, I offered this amendment and it needed to be perfected. I greatly appreciate the staff and the work of the team here so that we could get this in a form to where it certainly meets muster. This is a very important amendment. Half a century ago, our Nation was embroiled in a war in Vietnam. It divided the Nation. But for our young men and women who went forward and fought on our behalf, their loyalties were never divided. They did everything that they could every day to serve our Nation in a very difficult circumstance. What developed over that time were soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who became sick. They were exposed to Agent Orange. This was part of that war. Our Nation had chosen to defoliate as a means of protecting troops with Agent Orange. But what we learned over time is that there was a direct link between exposure to Agent Orange and nine maladies, including cancer, diabetes and Parkinson's. This body, in 1991, recognizing this, came together with the President of the United States and enacted the Agent Orange Act of 1991. Unfortunately, in 2002, there was an overreach on the part of the executive that narrowed that interpretation. And since that time, Members here on both sides of the aisle have been fighting to ensure that our sailors who served just offshore in Vietnam got access to the health care that they desperately need. Mr. Chairman, over half of these sailors who were exposed are already in Heaven. They are gone now. And for those that are left here, time is of the essence. It is an urgent matter that we get this passed. Three hundred twenty of my colleagues agree with this on both sides of the aisle, and about half the Senate. So today, we offer this amendment to reassert our article I prerogatives to ensure that, for every serviceman and woman that goes forward, that they know that, regardless of the difficulty of the fight and the difficulty of the proposition and what it may mean for the politics here in America, we will never turn our back on our servicemen and -women. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Announcement by the Chair The CHAIR. The Chair will remind Members to turn off cell phones when they enter the House Chamber. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, but I am not opposed. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, we support the amendment. We appreciate the good work that my friend from New York (Mr. Gibson) has done to advocate on behalf of all veterans, and particularly his commitment to helping those who suffered from Agent Orange exposure, as well as many other issues. So I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chair, I deeply appreciate the support of the chairman and ranking member, and I respectfully request the support of the House on this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gibson). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec.__. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used in contravention of Executive Order No. 13672 of July 21, 2014 (``Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity''). The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last night, this House adopted a provision as part of the defense bill that rolls back antidiscrimination provisions contained in executive orders issued by the President in recent years. This is one of the ugliest episodes I have experienced in my 3-plus years as a Member of this House. The inclusion of such hate-based language in a defense bill designed to support our military sends exactly the wrong message at a time when we should all be unified in supporting the efforts of our servicemembers around the world. My father was a veteran. He was nearly killed in the service of his country. I have never voted against a defense bill before. I never thought I would. Almost a quarter of the constituents I represent in the Hudson Valley of New York come from families where a member is serving in the military or has served in the military. I represent the United States Military Academy at West Point. We have helped 800 veterans, one at a time, out of my district office in my 3 years in Congress, and we have passed legislation directly aimed at making their lives better. So, it is not with an easy heart that I come to the House floor and oppose the defense bill, but this legislation snuck into the bill--and was kept in the bill--despite a bipartisan effort to remove it, sends exactly the wrong signal and it says that we are so concerned about discriminating against a group of LGBT Americans that we are willing to destroy the bipartisan cooperation we should have on the defense bill. So my amendment today gives us another chance. It gives us a chance to correct some of the damage done last night by some Members of this body. What it would say is quite simple: we shall not do anything in this bill that contravenes the antidiscrimination executive orders of the President. It is pretty simple. We should not be spending taxpayer dollars to promote hate, and we should not be justifying that by some religious exemption, when, in fact, the language in the defense bill simply rolls back the antidiscrimination provisions that the President put in an executive order to those contained in the original Civil Rights Act and the ADA. It is specifically designed to exclude LGBT Americans. And in doing that, it aligns itself with the parallel efforts we see happening in States like North Carolina. It is wrong and it doesn't have anything to do with our military; it doesn't have anything to do with fighting ISIS; it doesn't have anything to do with religious protections. It is about bigotry, plain and simple. Today, we have another chance to do the right thing and to send the right message and to stick up for our military. [[Page H2858]] Mr. DENT. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. DENT. I support the amendment, and I certainly oppose discrimination in any way, shape, or form, particularly as, in this case, it relates to Federal contracting. I do support the amendment. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Reclaiming my time, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and I want to acknowledge that it was the gentleman from Pennsylvania, together with Mr. Hanna from New York, who courageously led the effort to roll back the discrimination in a bipartisan way in the Rules Committee. And that effort was thwarted. So I am very honored by the gentleman's support, and I am honored by the position you have taken in this House over the last couple of days. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I do respect the gentleman for his right to come and offer under an open rule, in a different bill, his objections to what occurred last night. Last night, the House of Representatives passed the bill. And today, the gentleman is offering a limiting amendment that would turn back that agreement that we made. Mr. Chairman, several days ago, the House Armed Services Committee handled this issue. It was not sneaking something in. It was a straight-up vote. It was a vote that was held in the Armed Services Committee, it passed. The final vote was 60-2. Mr. Chairman, that is a bipartisan vote. That is a vote from people on the committee who viewed that they were not going to let one issue or another get in the way of supporting the men and women of our United States military. They very clearly--all of them on the committee-- understood during this long markup exactly the implications, and they lived with the decision. I am here today to say that the gentleman is fully entitled to do as he is doing, but the vote was held last night. The overwhelming viewpoint was let's support the United States military and let's get this done, not the next day come on the floor with spilled milk on your face and say: I want to go back and I want to relitigate a decision that we made last night with every Member here on the floor. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the gentleman. I admire the gentleman. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Well, I appreciate the admiration. Let me ask my colleague: Is it necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians to support our military? Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, that issue was handled--and the gentleman knows this--in committee. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. It was resolved last night. It was resolved last night in the affirmative. In other words, this House said that it would include in a defense bill a provision that would roll back basic employment questions for gays and lesbians. My question to my colleague is simply, Mr. Chairman, if that is necessary for the promotion of national defense. Is it necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians and transgender Americans to keep our country safe? Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the gentleman. I am not without an understanding that there are people who do have ideas which override other bigger ideas. I am simply saying to you, Mr. Chairman, I stand in opposition to what the gentleman is attempting to do here, the next day, in a separate bill, to limit what we did last night, when this body did understand that many people have a strong viewpoint that supports the gentleman, and more people have a viewpoint that is against that. That is not my point. My point is, we need to transcend that as a body. And we did last night. We spoke very clearly. We need to support the men and women of the United States military. And we do not believe this is a stumbling block because we don't view what the gentleman is saying is the critical and key issue. That is why I stand in opposition to what the gentleman is doing. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my time. The CHAIR. Is there an objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? Mr. SESSIONS. Objection. The CHAIR. Objection is heard. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney). Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I would like to again express my thanks for my colleague's admiration. It is nice to have admiration. It is better to have rights and it is better to be treated equally and without condescension. I would just note, Mr. Chairman, that the question remains unanswered of whether it is necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians in Federal contracting to protect our country, to support our troops? Is it necessary to remove employment protections in employers covering 28 million Americans so that we can fight the war on ISIS? Is it necessary to protect ourselves in our houses of worship by discriminating in Federal contracting in businesses that are in the business of commerce and in private contracting? It is a tired and old and false choice to suggest that we need to discriminate to keep ourselves safe, to keep ourselves free. And people in earlier times have made those arguments, and they have, one after another, been reversed. So the notion that because this House did it last night, it can't get it right today, is at odds with a lot of American history. This House got a lot of things wrong for a lot of people for a lot of years. And then finally, slowly, almost despite ourselves, we figured out that we can be safe and free and equal. And in fact, becoming more equal in some ways makes us safer because it is the promotion of our values through our actions and our ideas and our words, not just our weapons that promote our values around the world. {time} 1030 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his kindness. I want to briefly join in the gentleman's recounting of our history, and I want to remind people of the eloquent statement of the Attorney General, Attorney General Lynch, who indicated that civil rights is a very large tent, and it embraces all Americans. Whether it is religious freedom or religious rights, or whether it is civil rights issues dealing with the race and ethnicity of Americans, we have always overcome. I believe that the men and women of the United States military deserve better than to have the kind of poisonous amendments that undermine the very reason that they put on the uniform, for us to be free, to speak freely, to associate, and to stand as who we are. I am saddened because my history is a reminder that I did not stand equal in this Nation, either as a woman or an African American, or even as an immigrant, which my grandparents were. So I join in pleading with this House to not, in any way, strip us of civil rights and tear up the Constitution, the 14th Amendment, the Fifth Amendment of due process. That would be shame on us. I join the gentleman in his amendment, and I ask that we consider those who we like and who we dislike. They are Americans, and they deserve the right to be respected under the law. I would ask that the gentleman's amendment be accepted, voted on, respected; and let us be the Americans that our Constitution dictates and our flag says we are. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney).

B. Johnson, Sam Salmon Swalwell (CA) Takai {time} 1132 So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the last three lines of the bill. The Clerk read as follows: This Act may be cited as the ``Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017''. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise and report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4974) making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, directed him to report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. For what purpose does the gentleman from Maryland, the minority whip, seek recognition? Parliamentary Inquiry Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HOYER. I want to raise a parliamentary inquiry, initially, with reference to the fact that Mr. Ryan, our Speaker, has told us that, if people were in the well, the vote would be held open. I was standing in the well. No one came or no one had the courage to come into the well to change their vote. But notwithstanding that, the vote kept changing. Mr. Speaker, from a parliamentary perspective, how is that possible? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair may not yet have made a request for changes. Mr. HOYER. I saw no one come to the desk to change their vote, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman have a parliamentary inquiry? Mr. HOYER. The parliamentary inquiry is: How can the vote change when [[Page H2866]] no one comes to the well to change their vote? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair may not yet have made a request for changes. Mr. HOYER. I didn't hear the Chair request change. But I do know that, from my own personal observation, not one of those Members who apparently changed their vote--because it kept changing on the board-- came to this well and had the courage to change from green to red or red to green. How is that possible, Mr. Speaker? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has not stated a parliamentary inquiry. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The question is on the amendments. The amendments were agreed to. Parliamentary Inquiry Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I did not hear and, therefore, was not able to ask for a recorded vote on the motion to rise. The Speaker did not articulate that so the House could hear it, and I request a vote on the motion to rise. Now, the Speaker may tell me we are past that point, but the fact of the matter is, nobody on this House floor heard the Speaker articulate the issue of whether the Committee ought to rise. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The House is definitely past that point. Is the gentleman seeking a recorded vote? Mr. HOYER. On the motion to rise, yes, sir. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has put the question on the adoption of the amendments. Mr. HOYER. I ask for a recorded vote on the adoption of the amendment. Which amendment is the Speaker talking about? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has put the question on the amendments reported from the Committee of the Whole. Mr. HOYER. Yes, I do. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A recorded vote is requested. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my request for a recorded vote. It is my understanding that because the amendment was defeated, magically, without anybody coming to the well to change their vote, by giving to the majority the right to have the ability, without coming to the well and telling America that you were going to change a vote. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's request is withdrawn. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Recorded Vote Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 241, noes 183, not voting 9, as follows: [Roll No. 227] AYES--241 Abraham Aderholt Allen Amash Amodei Babin Barletta Barr Barton Benishek Bilirakis Bishop (MI) Bishop (UT) Black Blackburn Blum Bost Boustany Brady (TX) Brat Bridenstine Brooks (AL) Brooks (IN) Buck Bucshon Burgess Byrne Calvert Carter (GA) Carter (TX) Chabot Chaffetz Clawson (FL) Coffman Cole Collins (GA) Collins (NY) Comstock Conaway Cook Costello (PA) Cramer Crawford Crenshaw Culberson Curbelo (FL) Davis, Rodney Denham Dent DeSantis DesJarlais Diaz-Balart Dold Donovan Duffy Duncan (SC) Duncan (TN) Ellmers (NC) Emmer (MN) Farenthold Fincher Fitzpatrick Fleischmann Fleming Flores Forbes Fortenberry Foxx Franks (AZ) Frelinghuysen Garrett Gibbs Gibson Gohmert Goodlatte Gosar Gowdy Granger Graves (GA) Graves (LA) Graves (MO) Griffith Grothman Guinta Guthrie Hanna Hardy Harper Harris Hartzler Heck (NV) Hensarling Hice, Jody B.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the further consideration of H.R. 4974, and that I may include tabular material on the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaMalfa). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 736 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 4974. Will the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) kindly resume the chair. {time} 0914 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 4974) making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, with Mr. Collins of Georgia in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson) had been disposed of and the bill had been read through page 71, line 6. {time} 0915 Amendment Offered by Mr. Heck of Washington Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. Upon the acceptance by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of the newly constructed holes 10 through 18 at the golf course at American Lake Veterans Hospital on a portion of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, which were designed by Jack Nicklaus on a pro bono basis, the holes shall be designated as the ``Nicklaus Nine''. Mr. HECK of Washington (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered read. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved. The Clerk will continue to read. The Clerk continued to read. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Washington and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington. Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I actually plan on withdrawing my amendment, but would like to make my colleagues aware of some amazing work being done in my district on behalf of veterans and wounded warriors. Mr. Chairman, millions--millions--of people watched the U.S. Open at Chambers Bay in Washington's 10th Congressional District last June. It showcased, frankly, the irreplaceable beauty of golf in the Pacific Northwest. But just a 10-minute drive from Chambers Bay, you will also find yourself at beautiful American Lake. At American Lake, that is where veterans recover and heal from injuries at the VA facility, which is located near Joint Base Lewis- McChord. A big part of that recuperation includes a bit of TLC from another golf course in addition to Chambers Bay. Since 1955, 61 years, nine holes of golf at the American Lake Veterans Golf Course is where South Sound veterans could escape the stresses of their daily lives and engage in some healthy competition. And let's be honest, it is hard to look forward to a visit to the doctor, but looking forward to a round of golf with your buddies is something entirely different. It has become a great way for older vets to connect with younger vets for more recent conflicts. Currently, American Lake Veterans Golf Course--it is important that you hear this--is the Nation's only golf course designed specifically for the rehabilitation of wounded and disabled veterans. Almost all of the dedicated volunteers there are veterans as well. Well, except one, and his name is Jack Nicklaus--yes, that Jack Nicklaus--the ``Golden Bear,'' widely regarded, perhaps, as the greatest golfer of our time, who now spends his time actually designing golf courses. He is the one who helped design and expand the American Lake Veterans Golf Course to include a back nine. They went from nine holes to 18. The back nine is now in place, and the course is waiting for VA Secretary McDonald to sign the necessary paperwork to formally accept the course improvements. The course exists because of the determination of hardworking volunteers--really angels among us. And now it is time to honor one of those committed volunteers for his commitment to our veterans and wounded warriors, and officially designate holes 10 through 18 as the Nicklaus Nine. With the Nicklaus Nine, we will now have an 18-hole, 100 percent ADA accessible golf course to accommodate returning troops and our local combat veterans. With the Nicklaus Nine, we will have double the accessibility and green to offer our veterans who have given so much to all of us. Now, I am going to tell you a story, and I guarantee it is going to stay with you, I guarantee that you are going to remember this story. There is a program at American Lake Veterans Golf Course that teaches blind veterans how to play golf. One year, we had a local golfer--his name happens to be Ray Reed--who was sent to the National Blind Golf Tournament in Iowa. Ray Reed, blind, wounded warrior. And do you know what he did at that national golf tournament? He scored a hole in one. Yes, blind veterans can golf, and they learn how to do that at American Lake. It is incredible. They are an inspiration to all of us. Mr. Chairman, to avoid a point of order on my amendment, I would like to withdraw it at this time. But I hope that I can work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find another vehicle, or a standalone bill, to get this done. I strongly believe it to be appropriate to honor and bestow on he who has changed the name of golf, the Golden Bear, this honor for changing the lives of wounded warriors. I hope this will encourage the design and development of more golf courses around the U.S. devoted to our veterans and our wounded warriors. With that, Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleagues. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. The CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gibson Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available for this Act may be used by the Department of Veterans Affairs to preclude the territorial seas of the Republic of Vietnam from inclusion in the meaning of the Republic of Vietnam under the Agent Orange Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-4) and the amendments made by that Act. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved. Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chair, I am here this morning to bring forward an amendment that is for our sailors who fought in the Vietnam war. This is about ensuring they get the health care and the benefits that they have earned through their service in Vietnam. But in a broader sense, this is really about justice. This is about veterans who went forward and fought that war, a deeply unpopular war that divided our Nation. They were never asked [[Page H2850]] about their political leanings or what their views were on the war. They simply did what they were ordered to do. They went forward and they gave their very best effort to serve us. In the process of that war, we used Agent Orange to defoliate. In the case of these sailors, serving just offshore in Vietnam, we had ships that were involved in resupply operations at the ports and at the harbor, and they were vulnerable. They were vulnerable because there was vegetation near the ports and the harbors. As our countermeasure to that, we defoliated to give standoff for those ships to protect them. But what we have learned over time, Mr. Chairman, is that that was poisoning our sailors, and anyone that was in close proximity. Now, and in fact in 1991, this body, along with the Senate and the President of the United States of America, enacted a law, the Agent Orange Act of 1991, that ensured that our veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange had access to the health care and the benefits that they had earned. Regrettably, in 2002, executive overreach led to a rule that narrowed the interpretation of our law. Now it is so that you have to have served on the ground in Vietnam or in the Riverine Navy to get access to this law and to these benefits. Mr. Chairman, the people's representatives never spoke on that. This is an issue we have dealt with time and again in this Chamber, both sides of the aisle, fighting back, fighting for our article I prerogatives. And this is very clear here. This body spoke. We said we had to try to make right what was wrong. So now we have about 90,000 sailors that don't have access to health care. Mr. Chairman, be advised and be assured that Members of this body fight every day for these veterans in a case-by-case basis, and we do win some of these, but we don't win all of them. It is just flatly wrong. Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does is really ensure that our article I prerogatives are secured. That we go back to the original language that we passed and the President signed. I would ask all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Point of Order Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I make a point of order against this amendment. Although it is a very well-intended amendment, and I am very sympathetic to what he wants to do, I think there might be a way, if the gentleman withdraws and tries to perfect that amendment, that it might be made in order. This amendment proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI. The rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.'' The bill gives direction to that effect. I ask for a ruling from the Chair. Again, I would ask my colleague to consider withdrawing and see if he can perfect that amendment so that it would be made in order. The CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say, I have the deepest respect for the chairman, a dear colleague and friend. But I have to say that I am astounded that we would talk about a point of order here when we are talking about our language. This is what we passed. What we saw is that the executive branch, with fiat, changed what it is that we passed. So I don't know how it is that we are legislating to their executive overreach. This is merely an amendment that goes back to our language. And it is not just me standing here today; 320 of our colleagues in the United States House of Representatives, on both sides of the aisle, believe that this needs to get done. And nearly half of the Senate, an exact companion, also believe that. Now, because of our friendship and because of the way that we have worked together, I just want to enter into a colloquy and get clarification from the chairman. What I think I heard him say moments ago is that, if I withdraw, he will work with us so that we can reassert our Article I powers and ensure that we have justice for these Vietnam veterans who deserve these benefits. Can I get that clarification from the chairman? The CHAIR. The Chair will hear each Member individually on the point of order. A point of order is pending. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized to be heard on the point of order. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, on the point of order, the point I am trying to make is this: if the amendment is withdrawn, it can be reworked so that it would be in order. We believe that there is a way to do that even today. That is the offer I am making to you. If the amendment is withdrawn, there is a possibility that this amendment could be made in order, but it does have to be perfected. I am a cosponsor of the actual underlying legislation, so I support it. But at the moment, in our view, it does constitute legislation in an appropriation bill, and, therefore, it violates clause 2 of rule XXI. But I pledge to work to the best of our ability to try to make it in order, even today, if possible. The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized. Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chair, given the pledge of my dear friend from Pennsylvania to work to make sure that we have justice and that we can move forward and help these veterans, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. The CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used for the Veterans Experience Office. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a simple amendment to prevent wasteful new administrative spending within the VA General Administration Account, and to ensure that scarce resources are not diverted away from the priorities that need them most. My amendment will strengthen and support the position of this committee to ensure that none of the funds made available by this act may be used by the administration's proposed bureaucracy quagmire called the Veterans Experience Office. While the name may make this proposed new nationwide office sound like a good idea, this proposal would unleash a new cadre of Federal bureaucrats to stand between the veterans and their benefits, repeating those terrifying nine words, ``I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'' We all share the goal of improving each and every veteran's experience with the VA. However, it would be foolish to permit the creation of a new general administration program that would siphon off more than $72 million away from the programs and offices prioritized by this committee as those most in need of support. I commend the committee for identifying this wasteful proposal in their report, stating, ``While the committee supports the Secretary's efforts to improve the ways VA interacts with veterans, it has doubts about the wisdom of establishing a large new office with regional staffing at this late date in the administration.'' While the position of the committee is clear, my amendment is necessary to ensure that the administration is prohibited from transferring limited funds within the general administration account to fund this unwise and duplicitous proposal. This administration is notorious for ignoring the will [[Page H2851]] of Congress and seeking out loopholes to advance the executive branch's agenda. This track record of rogue behavior is why this amendment is so necessary in order to carry out the committee's recommendation and properly care for our veterans. The VA doesn't need more money to hire more people pushers to create an even larger bureaucracy between the veterans and their benefits. Instead, let's ensure resources are allocated where they have the most effective and efficient benefit for those who have given their country so much. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. I thank Chairman Dent and Ranking Member Bishop for their time. I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 0930 Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I understand the gentleman's concerns about starting this large, new office at the VA. As you can see from our report, we cut the request for General Administration by $81.3 million, largely because of our concerns about funding this large office; so I think we have already achieved what the gentleman is looking to accomplish. It is hard to imagine that the VA could find $81 million in another account to backfill this office. I will not oppose the gentleman's amendment. I will tell the gentleman, however, that this will inevitably become a conference issue because the Senate supports the creation of the office. I do not object to the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, the bulk of the request of the increase for the General Administration was intended for the establishment of the Veterans Experience Office. Up until now, the Veterans Experience Office's activities have been funded through the Office of Enterprise Integration. However, the FY 2017 budget proposes to make the Veterans Experience Office a standalone office within the General Administration and requests $72.6 million in funding and 204 full-time equivalents via direct budget authority. While we all support the Secretary's efforts to improve the way the VA interacts with the veterans, we had doubts about the wisdom of establishing a large, new office with regional staffing at this late date in the administration. It was decided not to include this funding. However, there is nothing in the bill that prevents the Secretary from continuing to fund the office in the way that he did in the previous fiscal year. Conversely, the amendment before us will prevent this office from being funded, period. I believe that the amendment is a bridge too far. While I don't support making the Veterans Experience Office a free- standing office, I also don't support taking the Secretary's flexibility away either. I believe that the bill is the right approach. I urge Members to oppose the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I rebut. This President and his agencies have shown time and time again that they are eager to ignore the will of Congress and to implement his agenda wherever they can. This is a necessary reminder that the VA is hardly a vestibule of good behavior. I think we need to make them concentrate on doing their procedures right that they currently cannot do right. I urge Members to accept my amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to-- (1) carry out the memorandum from the Veterans Benefit Administration known as Fast Letter 13-10, issued on May 20, 2013; or (2) create or maintain any patient record-keeping system other than those currently approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office in Washington, D.C. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I offer an amendment. I have offered similar amendments in the last 2 years, and they have passed each time. I had hoped that it would not be necessary to offer this amendment again this year. Unfortunately, an investigation from the Government Accountability Office that was released last month found that the VA schedulers are still manipulating appointment wait times and are underestimating how long veterans have to wait to get care at a VA facility. The GAO's most recent audit found that schedulers changed dates and shortened wait times for 15 to 20 percent of the cases reviewed. To make matters worse, USA Today recently claimed to have studied more than 70 investigative reports, and it found that these manipulations were being performed at the behest of the VA supervisors. Last year, a different inspector general investigation uncovered an actual memo from the VA leadership that encouraged this type of behavior. The memo I speak of is known as the Fast Letter 13-10, and it was handed down directly from the Office of the Director of the Veterans Benefits Administration to the Philadelphia VA Regional Benefit Office. I was appalled--but not totally surprised--to learn of this memo. The need for my amendment first surfaced 2 years ago as a response to explosive allegations about the Phoenix VA's keeping secondary, unofficial records of claims and appointment requests. My commonsense amendment simply prohibits the VA from keeping unofficial recordkeeping systems and manipulating wait times. I have said this before, but it is sad that we have to pass amendments to prevent this type of behavior. When government bureaucrats don't use good judgment or common sense, Congress must address these issues. We must have one consistent patient recordkeeping system within the VA in order to provide accountability, uniformity, and to prevent employee manipulation. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank Chairman Dent and Ranking Member Bishop for their time. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, this amendment is familiar to us since the gentleman offered it last year. I am not sure it is necessary to repeat the language this year since we know the VA has rescinded the Fast Letter guidance. After all, with the IG investigation into the dual scheduling systems, it doesn't seem likely that the VA is maintaining recordkeeping systems that are not approved by headquarters; but I am not going to object to the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Chair, we want to reward good behavior, and until they illustrate good behavior, the amendment is going forward. I appreciate the chairman's support. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Mica Mr. MICA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. (a) For an additional amount for ``Veterans Health Administration--Medical Services'' for grants to States under subchapter III of chapter 81 of title 38, United States Code, to expand, remodel, or alter existing buildings for furnishing nursing home [[Page H2852]] care to veterans in State homes that are former nursing home facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, as authorized by section 8133 of such subchapter, there is hereby appropriated, and the amount otherwise provided by this Act for ``Departmental Administration--General Administration'' is hereby reduced by, $10,000,000. (b) None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce the prioritization requirements in paragraphs (1)(C) or (2) through (5) of section 8135(c) of title 38, United States Code, with respect to the appropriation in subsection (a). The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. MICA. Mr. Chair, this is a simple amendment. I get to chair a subcommittee called Transportation and Public Assets. We get to oversee, in the public assets portion, all of the various properties around the United States that are public assets that are sitting idle. For example, in some States we have many VA properties that are medical--some hospitals, some nursing homes--that are sitting idle. Some of them are vacant, and some of them are closed. In order to put them into productive use for our veterans, I have tried to craft an amendment that, of course, doesn't apply to all of the facilities. I would like to do that, but this is fairly limited. It says that we have a nursing home that has been vacated or a nursing home that is not being used, and some of them, for several years, have sat vacant. This allows the Secretary discretion, and it also sets aside a small number of funds to help bring that property into a condition so that it can be transferred to the State. You have these in Pennsylvania, Mr. Chair. You have these across the Rust Belt. We have them even in Florida. What we don't have is the authority for the VA to move forward with these properties in their transferring and get the properties into condition and make the little bits of changes in the properties to transfer them to the States. This will apply to 49 States. There are 49 States that have State VAs. Many of them run nursing homes. In my State, for example, we run seven nursing homes now. We do it more cost-effectively. We can do it faster. We can take those idle assets and put them into use. In some places in the Rust Belt, you need to consolidate some of the facilities, and this will allow us to do that, too, and to run them cheaper and give better services to our veterans, not spread out the limited number of even staffers whom we have and administrators. Think of what you can save just on that. This is an amendment to try to move that process forward. We are not trying to get ahead of anybody who is in line for any kind of a VA facility. What we are trying to do is, again, tell the VA Secretary that he can move forward and put a little bit of money aside that will make a big, big difference with these facilities that are sitting vacant or half empty across the country, and it does apply to 49 States. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I understand there is a great demand throughout our Nation for State veterans' homes, and I wish we had the allocation to provide more for this program than we did. I do want to raise a concern with the language that it might--I say ``might.'' I am not saying ``definitely''--favor some States rather than increase funding for the entire State HOME Program. I was pleased to hear the gentleman state that he is not trying to jump ahead of other States that may be in line, but this is an issue that we are going to have to discuss at the conference committee. I am not going to object to the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MICA. I appreciate that. Mr. Chair, I think if there are differences in language, we have tried to work with the parliamentarian and the committee, and I know you all are busy in trying to get a very important piece of legislation out, but this small amendment can make a big difference. Again, this is in Rust Belt States, even in growing States like Florida, and there is no more cost to the Federal taxpayer in the operation. In fact, we will save money in the operation because the States take these over. And if the States take them over, it is one less burden on the VA. We have seen how difficult it is sometimes to get services from the VA, to have these facilities come on line. To the nursing home folks, listen to this. This is to nursing homes: we have a tremendously expanding, aging veterans' population, and we can't keep up with it all, and the Federal Government sometimes does it the least efficiently. This allows us to take those empty or half empty or partially used facilities and get them to the States, to sometimes consolidate the operations and save money on administration, operation, and expedite and get that service to our veterans as soon as possible. I urge the Members' support of this small amendment. I will be glad to work with the chairman, with the ranking member, and with others and craft this in any way that they feel comfortable, but the objective is very important at this stage. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used in contravention of sections 575.106 or 575.206 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, in a 2015 report from the VA Office of the Inspector General, it was discovered and reported that two senior staff members used their positions of power to financially and personally benefit from unethical behavior. Diana Rubens and Kimberly Graves not only coerced two VA managers to leave their positions against their will, they then manufactured circumstances that allowed for them to take the positions in question. To make matters worse, these women then took advantage of the VA's relocation expense program. Relocation bonuses may be given to current employees if an open position will be difficult to fill without such an incentive. In both of these instances, this clearly was not the case. In total, these women walked away with more than $400,000 in taxpayer funds. As if these actions weren't heinous enough, when the VA did attempt to hold Rubens and Graves accountable, the VA was subsequently overturned because they failed to discipline the other employees involved in this case. I am appalled--but ultimately, again, not surprised--to hear of this story. The VA has been riddled with scandal and plagued with lawlessness for years now. Chairman Miller said it best in the days that followed the reversal of the VA's decision, stating: ``Every objective observer knows that the Federal civil service system coddles and protects misbehaving employees instead of facilitating fair and efficient discipline; and until VA and Obama administration leaders acknowledge this problem and work with Congress to solve it, it will never be fixed.'' Mr. Chair, my amendment is a commonsense approach that simply reaffirms the requirements in the Code of Federal Regulations for employment incentives and relocation expenses. {time} 0945 Had the VA followed these regulations, Diana Rubens and Kimberly Graves wouldn't have been able to force two managers to leave and then get reimbursed for moving across the country to take their spots. I have said this before, but it is sad that we have to pass amendments to [[Page H2853]] prevent this type of behavior. When government bureaucrats fail to serve the American people through the use of common sense, Congress must address these issues personally. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their help. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time to speak in opposition, but I am not opposed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, no one shares the gentleman's concerns more than I do about the inappropriate relocation incentive payments the VA initially paid to two executives at the Philadelphia regional office. The VA has since reformed its policies, and I hope we will never ever hear again about such egregious staff misconduct and inappropriate reimbursements. However, I do think that the relocation incentive can be an important tool in some circumstances. Although I have no objection to the gentleman's amendment, I think this may need to be refined a bit in conference to reflect the usefulness of the tool, when used appropriately. As I said, there was egregious misconduct in Philadelphia, as the gentleman correctly points out. There is no question. In fact, many of us went and visited the Philadelphia regional office at about that time for a hearing, both Republicans and Democrats, authorizers and appropriators, to discuss the challenges at that particular office. That said, I have no objection to the amendment. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. DENT. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I have the deepest respect for the gentleman from Pennsylvania and for the gentleman who is offering the amendment, but I think that we may be just going a little bit too far here. Mr. Chair, this amendment will restrict the ability of the VA and the departments and related agencies funded in this act to use incentives to get experienced, talented, and capable individuals to take on difficult-to-fill positions. In other departments, they call these hardship posts. These are the jobs no one wants to do but are vital to the function of government. I think we can all agree that there are times when we need to provide incentives to those individuals whom we are asking to fill difficult jobs. At times, we need to take action to make a job more appealing, and sometimes we need to provide incentives to compete with the salaries that are typically paid outside of the Federal Government for some of the positions. I am concerned that this amendment will decrease the availability and quality of candidates possessing the competencies that are required for filling the hard-to-fill posts. We would not run a Fortune 500 company this way. Why are we limiting the ability of the U.S. Government to recruit and hire the best and the brightest? I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, trust is a series of promises kept, and it is very notable that the VA has lost the trust of Congress and the American people and, more importantly, our veterans. So until we get this right, until they can actually earn the respect and do the due diligence that they are expected to do for our veterans, it is a requirement of us to make sure, like a dog on a bone, to hold them accountable. I hope that everybody will vote for this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce the exception in clause (iii) of section 1.218(a)(8) of title 38, Code of Federal Regulations. Mr. GOSAR (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered as read. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona? There was no objection. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, recently, a veteran receiving care from the VA contacted my office to express his concern about pro-union fliers being posted in VA facilities. The veteran sent me a picture of one of these fliers, shown here for your reference. Right here. As you can see, this flier is an attempt to recruit union activists. Another flier, just above it, praises the agenda at the AFL-CIO. The veteran who contacted me was appalled that he was barraged by these pro-union advertisements during his visits to the VA. I couldn't agree more. Our Nation's heros should not be subjected to blatantly partisan advertisements while trying to receive medical care at VA facilities. My staff investigated this issue and found that, while solicitations like these are prohibited by law, union lobbyists were able to carve out a special exemption that allowed solicitation of labor organization membership or dues in VA facilities. This is a blatant abuse of taxpayer-funded facilities for the purpose of pushing a pro-union agenda. Given the obvious political nature of these groups, they should not be allowed to advertise in the VA facilities. Furthermore, the fact that VA employees are engaging in union activities while on the clock is unacceptable, given the current state of the VA. Any time these employees spend time doing union activities is time they cannot spend treating our veterans. With a massive backlog of cases and the fact that veterans have literally died waiting for care, this abuse of taxpayer money and our veterans must be put to an end. For that reason, I introduced the amendment currently at the desk. My amendment will prohibit the use of funds to implement, administer, or enforce the current union loophole. Defunding this exemption that allows unions to solicit members and dues at VA facilities would place unions under the same regulatory framework as other 501(c)'s. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, this is just another attack on organized labor and working people. The conduct that the gentleman wishes to prohibit is consistent with the National Labor Relations Act, and it is consistent with the traditions of this country. It is freedom of speech, and I think it ought to be allowed. I certainly object to this. I think that the working people ought to have an opportunity to express themselves and utilize fully the First Amendment, even in our VA facilities. I couldn't imagine that people who support the Constitution would want to muzzle working people and limit their ability to seek associations with like-minded people. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, once again, my amendment is critical to ensuring that our veterans receive the care they deserve in a nonpoliticized environment. Again, this amendment idea came from a veteran who was outraged about the VA being littered with union recruitment fliers. No veteran should be forced to endure blatantly partisan union advertisements in a taxpayer-funded building in order to receive the medical care they earned defending our country. We should all agree that the VA employees should be spending their taxpayer-funded time treating veterans, not posting union fliers and negotiating for higher wages, especially given the VA claims and the backlog of appeals that exist. I encourage adoption of the amendment. [[Page H2854]] I also want to make sure that people understand that this amendment would create that the unions be treated as any other 501(c). I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, well, once again, we want to make sure that everybody is treated fairly about this. As you can see, the blatant attempt here about recruitment to the unions within our VA is outright disgusting. We want to make sure that everybody is treated fairly and has the opportunity for fair speech, but this gives a hand up to the unions. I ask all my colleagues to vote for this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, again, this is another nasty rider. This is a rider that is totally unnecessary and inappropriate on this bill. It violates the Constitution. It certainly limits the rights of people in veterans facilities to be able to have freedom of speech and freedom of association. It is a bad proposition. I urge my colleagues to oppose it. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. Amendment Offered by Mr. Perry Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill, before the short title, add the following new section: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement or enforce Executive Order 13502. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, in 2009, the President issued Executive Order 13502, which strongly encourages Federal agencies to require project labor agreements, or PLAs, on Federal construction projects exceeding $25 million in cost. This amendment simply states, as already read, that none of the funds made available by this act may be used to implement or enforce this executive order. Now, project labor agreements, Mr. Chair, discourage what is called a merit shop contractor from bidding on taxpayer-funded construction contracts. Let me be clear. That means, if you don't have a union, you can't even bid. By the way, the vast majority of all work conducted in the United States, private or government, is conducted by nonunion contractors. It is not meant to disparage unions. It is just saying that there should be open competition for everybody. Because it is a limited competition, it actually drives up the cost that each of us pay for the construction, somewhere between 12 and 18 percent, needlessly. Even if it is only 12 percent, why pay it? It results in fewer infrastructure improvements simply because there is just not as much money because we are paying more for the ones that we are doing. It is a project-specific collective bargaining agreement with multiple unions that is unique only to the construction industry. It is done nowhere else, only in the construction industry. Now, the NLRA permits construction employees to execute a PLA, a project labor agreement, voluntarily. When the PLA is mandated by a government agency, construction contracts can be awarded only to contracts and subcontractors that agree to the terms and conditions of the PLA, essentially making them a union organization. Typically, the contractors have to recognize the union as the representative of their employees. No longer is the private business the representative, but only the union is the representative, and they have to hire from the union hall. Furthermore, if you ever pay prevailing wage or the Federal minimum wage for these kinds of projects, there is a thing called the fringe benefits, which includes your medical, your dental, your retirement. Those all will be put into union-managed benefits and pension programs. So even if you are a private employer that is not unionized, all that money, all those fringe benefits go to those programs. You must obey the restrictive and sometimes inefficient rules of job classification. So, for instance, if you are an electrician, you might want to wire something up, but if you need some conduit, you can't go get it because you are not a laborer. You are an electrician, and you have to wait for the laborer to go get it. That doesn't happen in nonunion environments. It is just inefficient. Furthermore, PLAs force employees to pay union dues, whether they are in the union or not, and then accept unwanted union representation. They also forfeit the benefits earned during the life of the project unless they join the union and become vested in union benefit plans. So they lose all that. Quite honestly, it is just simply a union recruiting plan at taxpayer expense. I don't have problems with the union; I just don't think that we should be paying for them. The PLA requirements and preferences on taxpayer-funded contracts expose procurement officials to intense political pressure because they are not negotiating normally. It is negotiated under the terms of the project labor agreement, not just a regular contract where you agree to do so much work and we would agree to pay so much. You agree to do it at this time, and we agree to accept that timeframe. It disrupts local collective bargaining agreements already in place because it is contract specific for the project at the time. Obviously, because of that, it stifles competition. {time} 1000 You stifle competition, it raises the cost. Who is paying the extra cost? The American taxpayer. It creates, or potentially creates, contracting and construction delays. We don't need any more delays at the VA. I think we have been through that plenty of times. Now, we just want to get the best price. We want everybody involved. We want everybody able to bid and able to participate. Let the government, let the taxpayer get the best job for the best price. Under this amendment, PLAs for military construction would not be forbidden. They are still not forbidden; they are just not mandated. Again, this amendment simply allows none of the funds made by the executive order to be used to implement or enforce Executive Order 13502. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The DOD does a lot of construction projects--this bill is certainly a testament to that--and these are often complex projects. They build facilities that are used to repair ships or store munitions, and usually when we read about large, complex construction projects, it is often in the context of delays or cost overruns or concerns on the workforce front. Folks want to see local opportunities on local projects. Now, a project labor agreement allows Federal agencies to negotiate exclusively with the building trades to ensure both union and open shop contractors are able to participate on the project. The agreement establishes quality worksite conditions and works to ensure construction is finished on time and under budget. When executed properly, PLAs are flexible, and they encourage participation from a wide variety of prime and subcontractors. In fact, PLAs are used on big, private projects. Look at every significant hotel project, casino project, stadium project. I worked professionally in economic development before I came here. These project labor agreements were vital to seeing projects happen. Why? Because they save money and because they keep projects on schedule and because they use local workers. You have seen the first project labor agreement in Navy history in my district--just one, mind you. What is the [[Page H2855]] outcome? Well, the project is going to be completed at a cost of $250 million below what was originally projected. With a contract that was worked out ahead of time, it meant that local workers were assigned on the front end. They brought in quality workers, local workers, and that strengthens our local communities. By partnering with local trades and using apprenticeship programs, this is helping to grow the next generation of tradespeople, giving opportunities to veterans and to women and minority communities. So it means that we are not just building a wharf in my district; it means we are building the next generation of workers. We are building the middle class. When you compare this with similar large, complex projects, the project that we just had with a project labor agreement had fewer problems and will deliver more value for taxpayers. So I do not understand why we would take this valuable tool out of our toolbox. We should be encouraging these efforts. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I just want to state I have no objection to the gentleman's amendment. The Department of Defense has awarded one construction contract, that is the explosives-handling wharf in Kitsap, Washington--I believe, in the gentleman's district--where the solicitation favored PLAs. The Department of Veterans Affairs has not awarded any contracts that have used PLAs, and they currently have no solicitations that favor PLAs. That said, I am very sympathetic with the gentleman's amendment, and I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I am very disappointed that, instead of seeking to pass the most bipartisan bill possible, my colleagues would prefer to weigh down the bill that funds veterans and military construction with a divisive rider. PLAs can be an essential tool to allow large projects to be completed on time and on budget. They are a benefit to both employers and employees. A project labor agreement provides a single collective bargaining unit, which allows for easier management of a project. They provide a reliable and uninterrupted supply of workers. They provide uniform wages, uniform benefits, overtime pay. A PLA sets the terms and conditions of employment for all workers onsite, including the work conditions and the rules. In addition, a PLA prohibits strikes and work stoppages. It is insulting that some would seek to prevent the use of PLAs on this bill when it is one of the best tools available to guarantee that veterans are hired as skilled construction workers. The use of a PLA does not prevent nonunion small businesses from participating. They have to agree to the terms and to sign on to the PLA. In addition, the PLA does not make the project union only. Simply put, project labor agreements help both the government and the private sector increase the efficiency and the quality of its project by promoting a business model that employs a highly skilled workforce. Such a workforce ensures that construction projects are built correctly the first time, on time and, as a result, on budget. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. I would note that this House has repeatedly refused to adopt similar amendments on this bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 30 seconds remaining. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate that this does not take this tool out of the toolbox. It just doesn't require it. With all due respect to those who say, well, it stops strikes from happening and it makes sure it is on time and on budget, a simple contract that millions of Americans sign every single day without a project labor agreement does that already. If project labor agreements are necessary, why aren't we all doing it with the work on our homes or the work on our businesses? The fact is it is not done everywhere because it is not necessary. The fact is it discourages participation, because you can participate if you want to join the union, or at least de facto join the union because you are going to do everything by the union code, every single thing, all your employees, all your representation. I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross). Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, let's start out by talking about some of the facts, because I hear some talking points from those who are trying to disturb and remove all workers' rights. There is nothing that currently is in place that mandates project labor agreements be used. If so, we would have thousands and thousands of them. It makes them permissible when a large and complex job would benefit from a precontract agreement, because that is what we are talking about. We are not talking about building a house or renovating a bedroom. Large, complex projects, that is what we are talking about. All it talks about is, before you sign a contract, make sure that you spell out very specifically the issues that could come up germane to that job. I have negotiated in my past life over 100 of these. Why? Because employers understand that this is to their benefit. There is a better cost ratio balance when they do a project labor agreement. They are public jobs, they are private jobs where nobody is mandating everything or anything. What we are saying here is that entering into a project labor agreement does one very important thing that nobody quite remembers here: Helmets to Hardhats, taking our veterans who served our country, giving them an opportunity to come home, put their uniform away, and go to work on a construction project. That alone is worth its weight in gold, and that is what Helmets to Hardhats does under a project labor agreement. It creates and allows that next generation of construction workers, those skilled craftsmen, to be part of that. Not one dime of that apprenticeship program comes from the government. This works. Why does it work? Because it saves money. The employer likes it because there are less headaches on the job, and it is probably the most important tool that could be in that worker's toolbox, to make sure that they level the playing field for a quality job that comes in on time and under budget. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be postponed. Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in contravention of subchapter III of chapter 20 of title 38, United States Code. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentlewoman from Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer the Jackson Lee amendment that clearly recognizes the importance of those who have served and [[Page H2856]] their lives after. My amendment says none of the funds made available by this act for the Department of Veterans Affairs may be used in contravention of subchapter III of chapter 20 of title 38 of the U.S. Code, which refers to the benefits for homeless veterans in training and outreach programs. Texas and Florida and California happen to be some of the States that have the highest number of homeless veterans. These are individuals who put on the uniform unselfishly. Now they are homeless for a variety of reasons. I hope that this amendment will reinforce and reemphasize the importance of ensuring that the rate of homelessness among veterans in the United States does not increase. As well, my amendment will remind us of our obligation to provide our veterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which includes adequate funding for programs like the Veterans Administration Supportive Housing that provides case management services, adequate housing facilities, mental health support, and addresses other issues that contribute to veterans' homelessness. I have, on my staff, a wounded warrior. We work a lot with homeless veterans. We visit their centers. We provide them with a sense that their commitment to this Nation will never be forgotten. Today in our country there are approximately 107,000 veterans, male and female, who are homeless on any given night, and perhaps twice as many, 200,000, experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year. I remember dealing with one of my nonprofits that was renting a space just to help three or four or five veterans. Unfortunately, the landlord was not sensitive to the fact that he did not have all the moneys to pay his rent. He was ultimately evicted. But it wasn't just he who was evicted, who was trying to be the Good Samaritan, it was veterans who called that place home. Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because of their poverty and lack of support from their family. In my hometown of Houston, for example, we have had large numbers of homeless veterans, but we have begun to work on it. I hope that this amendment will remind people of supportive service programs, residential rehabilitation programs, and HUD VA programs. I ask support of my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I do not oppose the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman has offered the amendment in previous years, and we have accepted it. I have no objection to it being included again in the bill this year. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the distinguished ranking member and a strong supporter of veterans and leadership on the MILCON bill. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I just want to let my voice be heard to congratulate the gentlewoman on her amendment. It has been adopted previously by this House. I think it is a great amendment. We support our homeless veterans. I congratulate the gentlewoman for offering the amendment. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, let me thank Mr. Dent and Mr. Bishop for their leadership, and certainly the appropriators, the full committee chairman and ranking member, on the tasks that they have before them. We are not going to end homelessness for veterans if we do not invest in programs that will help them. My amendment is to ensure that we are reminded that these veterans can be rehabilitated and can be provided a new pathway in life. It is simply a continuing way to say thank you. Whenever I speak before veterans, whenever I speak before the United States military, I remind them--though they do not need to be reminded--that they unselfishly put on the uniform without question. They put on the uniform without question, and they followed orders. They followed the orders of the Commander in Chief. So now I hope that we, as Members of Congress, will follow orders and increase investment in the HUD-VASH program allocated to communities with the highest numbers of homeless veterans, support all council agencies to promote and give incentives to local coordination or plans and have our local communities own these plans so that they will bring down the cost of homelessness or the size of homelessness to prevent or to provide, if you will, for the homeownership that is so very important that our veterans desire. {time} 1015 But the most important point is, why don't we stand and salute and stand at attention and say to our veterans: we hear you. Homelessness must not exist among our veterans. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. It reminds us of funding for veterans who are homeless, as well as for programs for veterans who are homeless. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. It is Jackson Lee Amendment No. 350. Thank you for this opportunity to describe my amendment, which simply provides that: ``None of the funds made available by this Act for the Department of Veteran Affairs--Benefits for Homeless Veterans and Training and Outreach Programs may be used in contravention of the title 38, Part II, Chapter 20, Subchapter II and III of the U.S. Code This amendment will help ensure that the rate of homelessness among veterans in the United States does not increase. I thank Subcommittee Chairman Dent and Ranking Member Bishop for their hard work in shepherding this important legislation to the floor. I offer the Jackson Lee Amendment because I believe reducing and eliminating homelessness among veterans, those who risked their lives to protect our freedom, should also be one of the nation's highest priorities. Homelessness among the American veteran population is on the rise in the United States and we must be proactive in giving back to those who have given so much to us. My amendment will help remind us of our obligation to provide our veterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which includes adequately funding for programs Veterans Administration Supportive Housing (VASH) that provide case-management services, adequate housing facilities, mental health support, and address other areas that contribute to veteran homelessness. VASH is a jointly-administered permanent supportive housing program for disabled Veterans experiencing homelessness in which VA medical Centers provide referrals and case management while Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) administer the Section 8 housing vouchers. Mr. Chair, our veterans deserve the best services available, and I believe that we could be doing much more for them. Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male and female) who are homeless on any given night. And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year. Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because of their poverty, lack of support from family and friends, and dismal living conditions in cheap hotels or in overcrowded or substandard housing. While significant progress has been made, ending homelessness among veterans remains a big challenge. In my hometown of Houston for example, between the years 2010 and 2012, the number of homeless veterans increased from 771 to 1,162. We must remain vigilant and continue to fight for those who put on the uniform and fought for us. Providing a home for veterans to come home to every night is the very least we can do. Mr. Chair, programs like VASH have succeeded in changing lives. In 2012 alone, 35,905 veterans lived in the public housing provided by VASH. I have seen the impact of such grants in my home state of Texas, and within my congressional district in Houston, and I am sure that this funding has positively impacted many communities across this country. In Texas, there are committed groups in Houston, working to eradicate the issue of homelessness. [[Page H2857]] For example, the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center has been involved in changing veterans' lives in a mighty way by providing Veterans and their families with access to affordable housing and medical services that will help them get back on their feet. Mr. Chair, we cannot let this issue of homelessness continue. I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee Amendment and commit ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran homelessness in America. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gibson Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to enforce VA Adjudication Procedure Manual M21-1, Part IV, Subpart ii, Chapter 1, Section H, Topic 28.h related to Developing Claims Based on Service Aboard Ships Offshore the RVN. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the Parliamentarian and the chairman and the ranking member. Earlier this morning, I offered this amendment and it needed to be perfected. I greatly appreciate the staff and the work of the team here so that we could get this in a form to where it certainly meets muster. This is a very important amendment. Half a century ago, our Nation was embroiled in a war in Vietnam. It divided the Nation. But for our young men and women who went forward and fought on our behalf, their loyalties were never divided. They did everything that they could every day to serve our Nation in a very difficult circumstance. What developed over that time were soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who became sick. They were exposed to Agent Orange. This was part of that war. Our Nation had chosen to defoliate as a means of protecting troops with Agent Orange. But what we learned over time is that there was a direct link between exposure to Agent Orange and nine maladies, including cancer, diabetes and Parkinson's. This body, in 1991, recognizing this, came together with the President of the United States and enacted the Agent Orange Act of 1991. Unfortunately, in 2002, there was an overreach on the part of the executive that narrowed that interpretation. And since that time, Members here on both sides of the aisle have been fighting to ensure that our sailors who served just offshore in Vietnam got access to the health care that they desperately need. Mr. Chairman, over half of these sailors who were exposed are already in Heaven. They are gone now. And for those that are left here, time is of the essence. It is an urgent matter that we get this passed. Three hundred twenty of my colleagues agree with this on both sides of the aisle, and about half the Senate. So today, we offer this amendment to reassert our article I prerogatives to ensure that, for every serviceman and woman that goes forward, that they know that, regardless of the difficulty of the fight and the difficulty of the proposition and what it may mean for the politics here in America, we will never turn our back on our servicemen and -women. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Announcement by the Chair The CHAIR. The Chair will remind Members to turn off cell phones when they enter the House Chamber. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, but I am not opposed. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, we support the amendment. We appreciate the good work that my friend from New York (Mr. Gibson) has done to advocate on behalf of all veterans, and particularly his commitment to helping those who suffered from Agent Orange exposure, as well as many other issues. So I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chair, I deeply appreciate the support of the chairman and ranking member, and I respectfully request the support of the House on this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gibson). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec.__. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used in contravention of Executive Order No. 13672 of July 21, 2014 (``Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity''). The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last night, this House adopted a provision as part of the defense bill that rolls back antidiscrimination provisions contained in executive orders issued by the President in recent years. This is one of the ugliest episodes I have experienced in my 3-plus years as a Member of this House. The inclusion of such hate-based language in a defense bill designed to support our military sends exactly the wrong message at a time when we should all be unified in supporting the efforts of our servicemembers around the world. My father was a veteran. He was nearly killed in the service of his country. I have never voted against a defense bill before. I never thought I would. Almost a quarter of the constituents I represent in the Hudson Valley of New York come from families where a member is serving in the military or has served in the military. I represent the United States Military Academy at West Point. We have helped 800 veterans, one at a time, out of my district office in my 3 years in Congress, and we have passed legislation directly aimed at making their lives better. So, it is not with an easy heart that I come to the House floor and oppose the defense bill, but this legislation snuck into the bill--and was kept in the bill--despite a bipartisan effort to remove it, sends exactly the wrong signal and it says that we are so concerned about discriminating against a group of LGBT Americans that we are willing to destroy the bipartisan cooperation we should have on the defense bill. So my amendment today gives us another chance. It gives us a chance to correct some of the damage done last night by some Members of this body. What it would say is quite simple: we shall not do anything in this bill that contravenes the antidiscrimination executive orders of the President. It is pretty simple. We should not be spending taxpayer dollars to promote hate, and we should not be justifying that by some religious exemption, when, in fact, the language in the defense bill simply rolls back the antidiscrimination provisions that the President put in an executive order to those contained in the original Civil Rights Act and the ADA. It is specifically designed to exclude LGBT Americans. And in doing that, it aligns itself with the parallel efforts we see happening in States like North Carolina. It is wrong and it doesn't have anything to do with our military; it doesn't have anything to do with fighting ISIS; it doesn't have anything to do with religious protections. It is about bigotry, plain and simple. Today, we have another chance to do the right thing and to send the right message and to stick up for our military. [[Page H2858]] Mr. DENT. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. DENT. I support the amendment, and I certainly oppose discrimination in any way, shape, or form, particularly as, in this case, it relates to Federal contracting. I do support the amendment. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Reclaiming my time, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and I want to acknowledge that it was the gentleman from Pennsylvania, together with Mr. Hanna from New York, who courageously led the effort to roll back the discrimination in a bipartisan way in the Rules Committee. And that effort was thwarted. So I am very honored by the gentleman's support, and I am honored by the position you have taken in this House over the last couple of days. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I do respect the gentleman for his right to come and offer under an open rule, in a different bill, his objections to what occurred last night. Last night, the House of Representatives passed the bill. And today, the gentleman is offering a limiting amendment that would turn back that agreement that we made. Mr. Chairman, several days ago, the House Armed Services Committee handled this issue. It was not sneaking something in. It was a straight-up vote. It was a vote that was held in the Armed Services Committee, it passed. The final vote was 60-2. Mr. Chairman, that is a bipartisan vote. That is a vote from people on the committee who viewed that they were not going to let one issue or another get in the way of supporting the men and women of our United States military. They very clearly--all of them on the committee-- understood during this long markup exactly the implications, and they lived with the decision. I am here today to say that the gentleman is fully entitled to do as he is doing, but the vote was held last night. The overwhelming viewpoint was let's support the United States military and let's get this done, not the next day come on the floor with spilled milk on your face and say: I want to go back and I want to relitigate a decision that we made last night with every Member here on the floor. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the gentleman. I admire the gentleman. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Well, I appreciate the admiration. Let me ask my colleague: Is it necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians to support our military? Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, that issue was handled--and the gentleman knows this--in committee. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. It was resolved last night. It was resolved last night in the affirmative. In other words, this House said that it would include in a defense bill a provision that would roll back basic employment questions for gays and lesbians. My question to my colleague is simply, Mr. Chairman, if that is necessary for the promotion of national defense. Is it necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians and transgender Americans to keep our country safe? Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the gentleman. I am not without an understanding that there are people who do have ideas which override other bigger ideas. I am simply saying to you, Mr. Chairman, I stand in opposition to what the gentleman is attempting to do here, the next day, in a separate bill, to limit what we did last night, when this body did understand that many people have a strong viewpoint that supports the gentleman, and more people have a viewpoint that is against that. That is not my point. My point is, we need to transcend that as a body. And we did last night. We spoke very clearly. We need to support the men and women of the United States military. And we do not believe this is a stumbling block because we don't view what the gentleman is saying is the critical and key issue. That is why I stand in opposition to what the gentleman is doing. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my time. The CHAIR. Is there an objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? Mr. SESSIONS. Objection. The CHAIR. Objection is heard. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney). Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I would like to again express my thanks for my colleague's admiration. It is nice to have admiration. It is better to have rights and it is better to be treated equally and without condescension. I would just note, Mr. Chairman, that the question remains unanswered of whether it is necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians in Federal contracting to protect our country, to support our troops? Is it necessary to remove employment protections in employers covering 28 million Americans so that we can fight the war on ISIS? Is it necessary to protect ourselves in our houses of worship by discriminating in Federal contracting in businesses that are in the business of commerce and in private contracting? It is a tired and old and false choice to suggest that we need to discriminate to keep ourselves safe, to keep ourselves free. And people in earlier times have made those arguments, and they have, one after another, been reversed. So the notion that because this House did it last night, it can't get it right today, is at odds with a lot of American history. This House got a lot of things wrong for a lot of people for a lot of years. And then finally, slowly, almost despite ourselves, we figured out that we can be safe and free and equal. And in fact, becoming more equal in some ways makes us safer because it is the promotion of our values through our actions and our ideas and our words, not just our weapons that promote our values around the world. {time} 1030 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his kindness. I want to briefly join in the gentleman's recounting of our history, and I want to remind people of the eloquent statement of the Attorney General, Attorney General Lynch, who indicated that civil rights is a very large tent, and it embraces all Americans. Whether it is religious freedom or religious rights, or whether it is civil rights issues dealing with the race and ethnicity of Americans, we have always overcome. I believe that the men and women of the United States military deserve better than to have the kind of poisonous amendments that undermine the very reason that they put on the uniform, for us to be free, to speak freely, to associate, and to stand as who we are. I am saddened because my history is a reminder that I did not stand equal in this Nation, either as a woman or an African American, or even as an immigrant, which my grandparents were. So I join in pleading with this House to not, in any way, strip us of civil rights and tear up the Constitution, the 14th Amendment, the Fifth Amendment of due process. That would be shame on us. I join the gentleman in his amendment, and I ask that we consider those who we like and who we dislike. They are Americans, and they deserve the right to be respected under the law. I would ask that the gentleman's amendment be accepted, voted on, respected; and let us be the Americans that our Constitution dictates and our flag says we are. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney).

B. Johnson, Sam Salmon Swalwell (CA) Takai {time} 1132 So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the last three lines of the bill. The Clerk read as follows: This Act may be cited as the ``Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017''. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise and report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4974) making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, directed him to report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. For what purpose does the gentleman from Maryland, the minority whip, seek recognition? Parliamentary Inquiry Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HOYER. I want to raise a parliamentary inquiry, initially, with reference to the fact that Mr. Ryan, our Speaker, has told us that, if people were in the well, the vote would be held open. I was standing in the well. No one came or no one had the courage to come into the well to change their vote. But notwithstanding that, the vote kept changing. Mr. Speaker, from a parliamentary perspective, how is that possible? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair may not yet have made a request for changes. Mr. HOYER. I saw no one come to the desk to change their vote, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman have a parliamentary inquiry? Mr. HOYER. The parliamentary inquiry is: How can the vote change when [[Page H2866]] no one comes to the well to change their vote? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair may not yet have made a request for changes. Mr. HOYER. I didn't hear the Chair request change. But I do know that, from my own personal observation, not one of those Members who apparently changed their vote--because it kept changing on the board-- came to this well and had the courage to change from green to red or red to green. How is that possible, Mr. Speaker? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has not stated a parliamentary inquiry. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The question is on the amendments. The amendments were agreed to. Parliamentary Inquiry Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I did not hear and, therefore, was not able to ask for a recorded vote on the motion to rise. The Speaker did not articulate that so the House could hear it, and I request a vote on the motion to rise. Now, the Speaker may tell me we are past that point, but the fact of the matter is, nobody on this House floor heard the Speaker articulate the issue of whether the Committee ought to rise. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The House is definitely past that point. Is the gentleman seeking a recorded vote? Mr. HOYER. On the motion to rise, yes, sir. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has put the question on the adoption of the amendments. Mr. HOYER. I ask for a recorded vote on the adoption of the amendment. Which amendment is the Speaker talking about? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has put the question on the amendments reported from the Committee of the Whole. Mr. HOYER. Yes, I do. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A recorded vote is requested. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my request for a recorded vote. It is my understanding that because the amendment was defeated, magically, without anybody coming to the well to change their vote, by giving to the majority the right to have the ability, without coming to the well and telling America that you were going to change a vote. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's request is withdrawn. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Recorded Vote Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 241, noes 183, not voting 9, as follows: [Roll No. 227] AYES--241 Abraham Aderholt Allen Amash Amodei Babin Barletta Barr Barton Benishek Bilirakis Bishop (MI) Bishop (UT) Black Blackburn Blum Bost Boustany Brady (TX) Brat Bridenstine Brooks (AL) Brooks (IN) Buck Bucshon Burgess Byrne Calvert Carter (GA) Carter (TX) Chabot Chaffetz Clawson (FL) Coffman Cole Collins (GA) Collins (NY) Comstock Conaway Cook Costello (PA) Cramer Crawford Crenshaw Culberson Curbelo (FL) Davis, Rodney Denham Dent DeSantis DesJarlais Diaz-Balart Dold Donovan Duffy Duncan (SC) Duncan (TN) Ellmers (NC) Emmer (MN) Farenthold Fincher Fitzpatrick Fleischmann Fleming Flores Forbes Fortenberry Foxx Franks (AZ) Frelinghuysen Garrett Gibbs Gibson Gohmert Goodlatte Gosar Gowdy Granger Graves (GA) Graves (LA) Graves (MO) Griffith Grothman Guinta Guthrie Hanna Hardy Harper Harris Hartzler Heck (NV) Hensarling Hice, Jody B.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the further consideration of H.R. 4974, and that I may include tabular material on the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaMalfa). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 736 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 4974. Will the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) kindly resume the chair. {time} 0914 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 4974) making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, with Mr. Collins of Georgia in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson) had been disposed of and the bill had been read through page 71, line 6. {time} 0915 Amendment Offered by Mr. Heck of Washington Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. Upon the acceptance by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of the newly constructed holes 10 through 18 at the golf course at American Lake Veterans Hospital on a portion of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, which were designed by Jack Nicklaus on a pro bono basis, the holes shall be designated as the ``Nicklaus Nine''. Mr. HECK of Washington (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered read. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved. The Clerk will continue to read. The Clerk continued to read. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Washington and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington. Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I actually plan on withdrawing my amendment, but would like to make my colleagues aware of some amazing work being done in my district on behalf of veterans and wounded warriors. Mr. Chairman, millions--millions--of people watched the U.S. Open at Chambers Bay in Washington's 10th Congressional District last June. It showcased, frankly, the irreplaceable beauty of golf in the Pacific Northwest. But just a 10-minute drive from Chambers Bay, you will also find yourself at beautiful American Lake. At American Lake, that is where veterans recover and heal from injuries at the VA facility, which is located near Joint Base Lewis- McChord. A big part of that recuperation includes a bit of TLC from another golf course in addition to Chambers Bay. Since 1955, 61 years, nine holes of golf at the American Lake Veterans Golf Course is where South Sound veterans could escape the stresses of their daily lives and engage in some healthy competition. And let's be honest, it is hard to look forward to a visit to the doctor, but looking forward to a round of golf with your buddies is something entirely different. It has become a great way for older vets to connect with younger vets for more recent conflicts. Currently, American Lake Veterans Golf Course--it is important that you hear this--is the Nation's only golf course designed specifically for the rehabilitation of wounded and disabled veterans. Almost all of the dedicated volunteers there are veterans as well. Well, except one, and his name is Jack Nicklaus--yes, that Jack Nicklaus--the ``Golden Bear,'' widely regarded, perhaps, as the greatest golfer of our time, who now spends his time actually designing golf courses. He is the one who helped design and expand the American Lake Veterans Golf Course to include a back nine. They went from nine holes to 18. The back nine is now in place, and the course is waiting for VA Secretary McDonald to sign the necessary paperwork to formally accept the course improvements. The course exists because of the determination of hardworking volunteers--really angels among us. And now it is time to honor one of those committed volunteers for his commitment to our veterans and wounded warriors, and officially designate holes 10 through 18 as the Nicklaus Nine. With the Nicklaus Nine, we will now have an 18-hole, 100 percent ADA accessible golf course to accommodate returning troops and our local combat veterans. With the Nicklaus Nine, we will have double the accessibility and green to offer our veterans who have given so much to all of us. Now, I am going to tell you a story, and I guarantee it is going to stay with you, I guarantee that you are going to remember this story. There is a program at American Lake Veterans Golf Course that teaches blind veterans how to play golf. One year, we had a local golfer--his name happens to be Ray Reed--who was sent to the National Blind Golf Tournament in Iowa. Ray Reed, blind, wounded warrior. And do you know what he did at that national golf tournament? He scored a hole in one. Yes, blind veterans can golf, and they learn how to do that at American Lake. It is incredible. They are an inspiration to all of us. Mr. Chairman, to avoid a point of order on my amendment, I would like to withdraw it at this time. But I hope that I can work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find another vehicle, or a standalone bill, to get this done. I strongly believe it to be appropriate to honor and bestow on he who has changed the name of golf, the Golden Bear, this honor for changing the lives of wounded warriors. I hope this will encourage the design and development of more golf courses around the U.S. devoted to our veterans and our wounded warriors. With that, Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleagues. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. The CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gibson Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available for this Act may be used by the Department of Veterans Affairs to preclude the territorial seas of the Republic of Vietnam from inclusion in the meaning of the Republic of Vietnam under the Agent Orange Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-4) and the amendments made by that Act. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved. Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chair, I am here this morning to bring forward an amendment that is for our sailors who fought in the Vietnam war. This is about ensuring they get the health care and the benefits that they have earned through their service in Vietnam. But in a broader sense, this is really about justice. This is about veterans who went forward and fought that war, a deeply unpopular war that divided our Nation. They were never asked [[Page H2850]] about their political leanings or what their views were on the war. They simply did what they were ordered to do. They went forward and they gave their very best effort to serve us. In the process of that war, we used Agent Orange to defoliate. In the case of these sailors, serving just offshore in Vietnam, we had ships that were involved in resupply operations at the ports and at the harbor, and they were vulnerable. They were vulnerable because there was vegetation near the ports and the harbors. As our countermeasure to that, we defoliated to give standoff for those ships to protect them. But what we have learned over time, Mr. Chairman, is that that was poisoning our sailors, and anyone that was in close proximity. Now, and in fact in 1991, this body, along with the Senate and the President of the United States of America, enacted a law, the Agent Orange Act of 1991, that ensured that our veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange had access to the health care and the benefits that they had earned. Regrettably, in 2002, executive overreach led to a rule that narrowed the interpretation of our law. Now it is so that you have to have served on the ground in Vietnam or in the Riverine Navy to get access to this law and to these benefits. Mr. Chairman, the people's representatives never spoke on that. This is an issue we have dealt with time and again in this Chamber, both sides of the aisle, fighting back, fighting for our article I prerogatives. And this is very clear here. This body spoke. We said we had to try to make right what was wrong. So now we have about 90,000 sailors that don't have access to health care. Mr. Chairman, be advised and be assured that Members of this body fight every day for these veterans in a case-by-case basis, and we do win some of these, but we don't win all of them. It is just flatly wrong. Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does is really ensure that our article I prerogatives are secured. That we go back to the original language that we passed and the President signed. I would ask all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Point of Order Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I make a point of order against this amendment. Although it is a very well-intended amendment, and I am very sympathetic to what he wants to do, I think there might be a way, if the gentleman withdraws and tries to perfect that amendment, that it might be made in order. This amendment proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI. The rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.'' The bill gives direction to that effect. I ask for a ruling from the Chair. Again, I would ask my colleague to consider withdrawing and see if he can perfect that amendment so that it would be made in order. The CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say, I have the deepest respect for the chairman, a dear colleague and friend. But I have to say that I am astounded that we would talk about a point of order here when we are talking about our language. This is what we passed. What we saw is that the executive branch, with fiat, changed what it is that we passed. So I don't know how it is that we are legislating to their executive overreach. This is merely an amendment that goes back to our language. And it is not just me standing here today; 320 of our colleagues in the United States House of Representatives, on both sides of the aisle, believe that this needs to get done. And nearly half of the Senate, an exact companion, also believe that. Now, because of our friendship and because of the way that we have worked together, I just want to enter into a colloquy and get clarification from the chairman. What I think I heard him say moments ago is that, if I withdraw, he will work with us so that we can reassert our Article I powers and ensure that we have justice for these Vietnam veterans who deserve these benefits. Can I get that clarification from the chairman? The CHAIR. The Chair will hear each Member individually on the point of order. A point of order is pending. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized to be heard on the point of order. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, on the point of order, the point I am trying to make is this: if the amendment is withdrawn, it can be reworked so that it would be in order. We believe that there is a way to do that even today. That is the offer I am making to you. If the amendment is withdrawn, there is a possibility that this amendment could be made in order, but it does have to be perfected. I am a cosponsor of the actual underlying legislation, so I support it. But at the moment, in our view, it does constitute legislation in an appropriation bill, and, therefore, it violates clause 2 of rule XXI. But I pledge to work to the best of our ability to try to make it in order, even today, if possible. The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized. Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chair, given the pledge of my dear friend from Pennsylvania to work to make sure that we have justice and that we can move forward and help these veterans, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. The CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used for the Veterans Experience Office. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a simple amendment to prevent wasteful new administrative spending within the VA General Administration Account, and to ensure that scarce resources are not diverted away from the priorities that need them most. My amendment will strengthen and support the position of this committee to ensure that none of the funds made available by this act may be used by the administration's proposed bureaucracy quagmire called the Veterans Experience Office. While the name may make this proposed new nationwide office sound like a good idea, this proposal would unleash a new cadre of Federal bureaucrats to stand between the veterans and their benefits, repeating those terrifying nine words, ``I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'' We all share the goal of improving each and every veteran's experience with the VA. However, it would be foolish to permit the creation of a new general administration program that would siphon off more than $72 million away from the programs and offices prioritized by this committee as those most in need of support. I commend the committee for identifying this wasteful proposal in their report, stating, ``While the committee supports the Secretary's efforts to improve the ways VA interacts with veterans, it has doubts about the wisdom of establishing a large new office with regional staffing at this late date in the administration.'' While the position of the committee is clear, my amendment is necessary to ensure that the administration is prohibited from transferring limited funds within the general administration account to fund this unwise and duplicitous proposal. This administration is notorious for ignoring the will [[Page H2851]] of Congress and seeking out loopholes to advance the executive branch's agenda. This track record of rogue behavior is why this amendment is so necessary in order to carry out the committee's recommendation and properly care for our veterans. The VA doesn't need more money to hire more people pushers to create an even larger bureaucracy between the veterans and their benefits. Instead, let's ensure resources are allocated where they have the most effective and efficient benefit for those who have given their country so much. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. I thank Chairman Dent and Ranking Member Bishop for their time. I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 0930 Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I understand the gentleman's concerns about starting this large, new office at the VA. As you can see from our report, we cut the request for General Administration by $81.3 million, largely because of our concerns about funding this large office; so I think we have already achieved what the gentleman is looking to accomplish. It is hard to imagine that the VA could find $81 million in another account to backfill this office. I will not oppose the gentleman's amendment. I will tell the gentleman, however, that this will inevitably become a conference issue because the Senate supports the creation of the office. I do not object to the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, the bulk of the request of the increase for the General Administration was intended for the establishment of the Veterans Experience Office. Up until now, the Veterans Experience Office's activities have been funded through the Office of Enterprise Integration. However, the FY 2017 budget proposes to make the Veterans Experience Office a standalone office within the General Administration and requests $72.6 million in funding and 204 full-time equivalents via direct budget authority. While we all support the Secretary's efforts to improve the way the VA interacts with the veterans, we had doubts about the wisdom of establishing a large, new office with regional staffing at this late date in the administration. It was decided not to include this funding. However, there is nothing in the bill that prevents the Secretary from continuing to fund the office in the way that he did in the previous fiscal year. Conversely, the amendment before us will prevent this office from being funded, period. I believe that the amendment is a bridge too far. While I don't support making the Veterans Experience Office a free- standing office, I also don't support taking the Secretary's flexibility away either. I believe that the bill is the right approach. I urge Members to oppose the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I rebut. This President and his agencies have shown time and time again that they are eager to ignore the will of Congress and to implement his agenda wherever they can. This is a necessary reminder that the VA is hardly a vestibule of good behavior. I think we need to make them concentrate on doing their procedures right that they currently cannot do right. I urge Members to accept my amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to-- (1) carry out the memorandum from the Veterans Benefit Administration known as Fast Letter 13-10, issued on May 20, 2013; or (2) create or maintain any patient record-keeping system other than those currently approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office in Washington, D.C. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I offer an amendment. I have offered similar amendments in the last 2 years, and they have passed each time. I had hoped that it would not be necessary to offer this amendment again this year. Unfortunately, an investigation from the Government Accountability Office that was released last month found that the VA schedulers are still manipulating appointment wait times and are underestimating how long veterans have to wait to get care at a VA facility. The GAO's most recent audit found that schedulers changed dates and shortened wait times for 15 to 20 percent of the cases reviewed. To make matters worse, USA Today recently claimed to have studied more than 70 investigative reports, and it found that these manipulations were being performed at the behest of the VA supervisors. Last year, a different inspector general investigation uncovered an actual memo from the VA leadership that encouraged this type of behavior. The memo I speak of is known as the Fast Letter 13-10, and it was handed down directly from the Office of the Director of the Veterans Benefits Administration to the Philadelphia VA Regional Benefit Office. I was appalled--but not totally surprised--to learn of this memo. The need for my amendment first surfaced 2 years ago as a response to explosive allegations about the Phoenix VA's keeping secondary, unofficial records of claims and appointment requests. My commonsense amendment simply prohibits the VA from keeping unofficial recordkeeping systems and manipulating wait times. I have said this before, but it is sad that we have to pass amendments to prevent this type of behavior. When government bureaucrats don't use good judgment or common sense, Congress must address these issues. We must have one consistent patient recordkeeping system within the VA in order to provide accountability, uniformity, and to prevent employee manipulation. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank Chairman Dent and Ranking Member Bishop for their time. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, this amendment is familiar to us since the gentleman offered it last year. I am not sure it is necessary to repeat the language this year since we know the VA has rescinded the Fast Letter guidance. After all, with the IG investigation into the dual scheduling systems, it doesn't seem likely that the VA is maintaining recordkeeping systems that are not approved by headquarters; but I am not going to object to the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Chair, we want to reward good behavior, and until they illustrate good behavior, the amendment is going forward. I appreciate the chairman's support. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Mica Mr. MICA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. (a) For an additional amount for ``Veterans Health Administration--Medical Services'' for grants to States under subchapter III of chapter 81 of title 38, United States Code, to expand, remodel, or alter existing buildings for furnishing nursing home [[Page H2852]] care to veterans in State homes that are former nursing home facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, as authorized by section 8133 of such subchapter, there is hereby appropriated, and the amount otherwise provided by this Act for ``Departmental Administration--General Administration'' is hereby reduced by, $10,000,000. (b) None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce the prioritization requirements in paragraphs (1)(C) or (2) through (5) of section 8135(c) of title 38, United States Code, with respect to the appropriation in subsection (a). The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. MICA. Mr. Chair, this is a simple amendment. I get to chair a subcommittee called Transportation and Public Assets. We get to oversee, in the public assets portion, all of the various properties around the United States that are public assets that are sitting idle. For example, in some States we have many VA properties that are medical--some hospitals, some nursing homes--that are sitting idle. Some of them are vacant, and some of them are closed. In order to put them into productive use for our veterans, I have tried to craft an amendment that, of course, doesn't apply to all of the facilities. I would like to do that, but this is fairly limited. It says that we have a nursing home that has been vacated or a nursing home that is not being used, and some of them, for several years, have sat vacant. This allows the Secretary discretion, and it also sets aside a small number of funds to help bring that property into a condition so that it can be transferred to the State. You have these in Pennsylvania, Mr. Chair. You have these across the Rust Belt. We have them even in Florida. What we don't have is the authority for the VA to move forward with these properties in their transferring and get the properties into condition and make the little bits of changes in the properties to transfer them to the States. This will apply to 49 States. There are 49 States that have State VAs. Many of them run nursing homes. In my State, for example, we run seven nursing homes now. We do it more cost-effectively. We can do it faster. We can take those idle assets and put them into use. In some places in the Rust Belt, you need to consolidate some of the facilities, and this will allow us to do that, too, and to run them cheaper and give better services to our veterans, not spread out the limited number of even staffers whom we have and administrators. Think of what you can save just on that. This is an amendment to try to move that process forward. We are not trying to get ahead of anybody who is in line for any kind of a VA facility. What we are trying to do is, again, tell the VA Secretary that he can move forward and put a little bit of money aside that will make a big, big difference with these facilities that are sitting vacant or half empty across the country, and it does apply to 49 States. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I understand there is a great demand throughout our Nation for State veterans' homes, and I wish we had the allocation to provide more for this program than we did. I do want to raise a concern with the language that it might--I say ``might.'' I am not saying ``definitely''--favor some States rather than increase funding for the entire State HOME Program. I was pleased to hear the gentleman state that he is not trying to jump ahead of other States that may be in line, but this is an issue that we are going to have to discuss at the conference committee. I am not going to object to the amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MICA. I appreciate that. Mr. Chair, I think if there are differences in language, we have tried to work with the parliamentarian and the committee, and I know you all are busy in trying to get a very important piece of legislation out, but this small amendment can make a big difference. Again, this is in Rust Belt States, even in growing States like Florida, and there is no more cost to the Federal taxpayer in the operation. In fact, we will save money in the operation because the States take these over. And if the States take them over, it is one less burden on the VA. We have seen how difficult it is sometimes to get services from the VA, to have these facilities come on line. To the nursing home folks, listen to this. This is to nursing homes: we have a tremendously expanding, aging veterans' population, and we can't keep up with it all, and the Federal Government sometimes does it the least efficiently. This allows us to take those empty or half empty or partially used facilities and get them to the States, to sometimes consolidate the operations and save money on administration, operation, and expedite and get that service to our veterans as soon as possible. I urge the Members' support of this small amendment. I will be glad to work with the chairman, with the ranking member, and with others and craft this in any way that they feel comfortable, but the objective is very important at this stage. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used in contravention of sections 575.106 or 575.206 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, in a 2015 report from the VA Office of the Inspector General, it was discovered and reported that two senior staff members used their positions of power to financially and personally benefit from unethical behavior. Diana Rubens and Kimberly Graves not only coerced two VA managers to leave their positions against their will, they then manufactured circumstances that allowed for them to take the positions in question. To make matters worse, these women then took advantage of the VA's relocation expense program. Relocation bonuses may be given to current employees if an open position will be difficult to fill without such an incentive. In both of these instances, this clearly was not the case. In total, these women walked away with more than $400,000 in taxpayer funds. As if these actions weren't heinous enough, when the VA did attempt to hold Rubens and Graves accountable, the VA was subsequently overturned because they failed to discipline the other employees involved in this case. I am appalled--but ultimately, again, not surprised--to hear of this story. The VA has been riddled with scandal and plagued with lawlessness for years now. Chairman Miller said it best in the days that followed the reversal of the VA's decision, stating: ``Every objective observer knows that the Federal civil service system coddles and protects misbehaving employees instead of facilitating fair and efficient discipline; and until VA and Obama administration leaders acknowledge this problem and work with Congress to solve it, it will never be fixed.'' Mr. Chair, my amendment is a commonsense approach that simply reaffirms the requirements in the Code of Federal Regulations for employment incentives and relocation expenses. {time} 0945 Had the VA followed these regulations, Diana Rubens and Kimberly Graves wouldn't have been able to force two managers to leave and then get reimbursed for moving across the country to take their spots. I have said this before, but it is sad that we have to pass amendments to [[Page H2853]] prevent this type of behavior. When government bureaucrats fail to serve the American people through the use of common sense, Congress must address these issues personally. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their help. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time to speak in opposition, but I am not opposed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, no one shares the gentleman's concerns more than I do about the inappropriate relocation incentive payments the VA initially paid to two executives at the Philadelphia regional office. The VA has since reformed its policies, and I hope we will never ever hear again about such egregious staff misconduct and inappropriate reimbursements. However, I do think that the relocation incentive can be an important tool in some circumstances. Although I have no objection to the gentleman's amendment, I think this may need to be refined a bit in conference to reflect the usefulness of the tool, when used appropriately. As I said, there was egregious misconduct in Philadelphia, as the gentleman correctly points out. There is no question. In fact, many of us went and visited the Philadelphia regional office at about that time for a hearing, both Republicans and Democrats, authorizers and appropriators, to discuss the challenges at that particular office. That said, I have no objection to the amendment. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. DENT. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I have the deepest respect for the gentleman from Pennsylvania and for the gentleman who is offering the amendment, but I think that we may be just going a little bit too far here. Mr. Chair, this amendment will restrict the ability of the VA and the departments and related agencies funded in this act to use incentives to get experienced, talented, and capable individuals to take on difficult-to-fill positions. In other departments, they call these hardship posts. These are the jobs no one wants to do but are vital to the function of government. I think we can all agree that there are times when we need to provide incentives to those individuals whom we are asking to fill difficult jobs. At times, we need to take action to make a job more appealing, and sometimes we need to provide incentives to compete with the salaries that are typically paid outside of the Federal Government for some of the positions. I am concerned that this amendment will decrease the availability and quality of candidates possessing the competencies that are required for filling the hard-to-fill posts. We would not run a Fortune 500 company this way. Why are we limiting the ability of the U.S. Government to recruit and hire the best and the brightest? I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, trust is a series of promises kept, and it is very notable that the VA has lost the trust of Congress and the American people and, more importantly, our veterans. So until we get this right, until they can actually earn the respect and do the due diligence that they are expected to do for our veterans, it is a requirement of us to make sure, like a dog on a bone, to hold them accountable. I hope that everybody will vote for this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce the exception in clause (iii) of section 1.218(a)(8) of title 38, Code of Federal Regulations. Mr. GOSAR (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered as read. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona? There was no objection. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, recently, a veteran receiving care from the VA contacted my office to express his concern about pro-union fliers being posted in VA facilities. The veteran sent me a picture of one of these fliers, shown here for your reference. Right here. As you can see, this flier is an attempt to recruit union activists. Another flier, just above it, praises the agenda at the AFL-CIO. The veteran who contacted me was appalled that he was barraged by these pro-union advertisements during his visits to the VA. I couldn't agree more. Our Nation's heros should not be subjected to blatantly partisan advertisements while trying to receive medical care at VA facilities. My staff investigated this issue and found that, while solicitations like these are prohibited by law, union lobbyists were able to carve out a special exemption that allowed solicitation of labor organization membership or dues in VA facilities. This is a blatant abuse of taxpayer-funded facilities for the purpose of pushing a pro-union agenda. Given the obvious political nature of these groups, they should not be allowed to advertise in the VA facilities. Furthermore, the fact that VA employees are engaging in union activities while on the clock is unacceptable, given the current state of the VA. Any time these employees spend time doing union activities is time they cannot spend treating our veterans. With a massive backlog of cases and the fact that veterans have literally died waiting for care, this abuse of taxpayer money and our veterans must be put to an end. For that reason, I introduced the amendment currently at the desk. My amendment will prohibit the use of funds to implement, administer, or enforce the current union loophole. Defunding this exemption that allows unions to solicit members and dues at VA facilities would place unions under the same regulatory framework as other 501(c)'s. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, this is just another attack on organized labor and working people. The conduct that the gentleman wishes to prohibit is consistent with the National Labor Relations Act, and it is consistent with the traditions of this country. It is freedom of speech, and I think it ought to be allowed. I certainly object to this. I think that the working people ought to have an opportunity to express themselves and utilize fully the First Amendment, even in our VA facilities. I couldn't imagine that people who support the Constitution would want to muzzle working people and limit their ability to seek associations with like-minded people. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, once again, my amendment is critical to ensuring that our veterans receive the care they deserve in a nonpoliticized environment. Again, this amendment idea came from a veteran who was outraged about the VA being littered with union recruitment fliers. No veteran should be forced to endure blatantly partisan union advertisements in a taxpayer-funded building in order to receive the medical care they earned defending our country. We should all agree that the VA employees should be spending their taxpayer-funded time treating veterans, not posting union fliers and negotiating for higher wages, especially given the VA claims and the backlog of appeals that exist. I encourage adoption of the amendment. [[Page H2854]] I also want to make sure that people understand that this amendment would create that the unions be treated as any other 501(c). I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, well, once again, we want to make sure that everybody is treated fairly about this. As you can see, the blatant attempt here about recruitment to the unions within our VA is outright disgusting. We want to make sure that everybody is treated fairly and has the opportunity for fair speech, but this gives a hand up to the unions. I ask all my colleagues to vote for this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, again, this is another nasty rider. This is a rider that is totally unnecessary and inappropriate on this bill. It violates the Constitution. It certainly limits the rights of people in veterans facilities to be able to have freedom of speech and freedom of association. It is a bad proposition. I urge my colleagues to oppose it. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. Amendment Offered by Mr. Perry Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill, before the short title, add the following new section: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement or enforce Executive Order 13502. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, in 2009, the President issued Executive Order 13502, which strongly encourages Federal agencies to require project labor agreements, or PLAs, on Federal construction projects exceeding $25 million in cost. This amendment simply states, as already read, that none of the funds made available by this act may be used to implement or enforce this executive order. Now, project labor agreements, Mr. Chair, discourage what is called a merit shop contractor from bidding on taxpayer-funded construction contracts. Let me be clear. That means, if you don't have a union, you can't even bid. By the way, the vast majority of all work conducted in the United States, private or government, is conducted by nonunion contractors. It is not meant to disparage unions. It is just saying that there should be open competition for everybody. Because it is a limited competition, it actually drives up the cost that each of us pay for the construction, somewhere between 12 and 18 percent, needlessly. Even if it is only 12 percent, why pay it? It results in fewer infrastructure improvements simply because there is just not as much money because we are paying more for the ones that we are doing. It is a project-specific collective bargaining agreement with multiple unions that is unique only to the construction industry. It is done nowhere else, only in the construction industry. Now, the NLRA permits construction employees to execute a PLA, a project labor agreement, voluntarily. When the PLA is mandated by a government agency, construction contracts can be awarded only to contracts and subcontractors that agree to the terms and conditions of the PLA, essentially making them a union organization. Typically, the contractors have to recognize the union as the representative of their employees. No longer is the private business the representative, but only the union is the representative, and they have to hire from the union hall. Furthermore, if you ever pay prevailing wage or the Federal minimum wage for these kinds of projects, there is a thing called the fringe benefits, which includes your medical, your dental, your retirement. Those all will be put into union-managed benefits and pension programs. So even if you are a private employer that is not unionized, all that money, all those fringe benefits go to those programs. You must obey the restrictive and sometimes inefficient rules of job classification. So, for instance, if you are an electrician, you might want to wire something up, but if you need some conduit, you can't go get it because you are not a laborer. You are an electrician, and you have to wait for the laborer to go get it. That doesn't happen in nonunion environments. It is just inefficient. Furthermore, PLAs force employees to pay union dues, whether they are in the union or not, and then accept unwanted union representation. They also forfeit the benefits earned during the life of the project unless they join the union and become vested in union benefit plans. So they lose all that. Quite honestly, it is just simply a union recruiting plan at taxpayer expense. I don't have problems with the union; I just don't think that we should be paying for them. The PLA requirements and preferences on taxpayer-funded contracts expose procurement officials to intense political pressure because they are not negotiating normally. It is negotiated under the terms of the project labor agreement, not just a regular contract where you agree to do so much work and we would agree to pay so much. You agree to do it at this time, and we agree to accept that timeframe. It disrupts local collective bargaining agreements already in place because it is contract specific for the project at the time. Obviously, because of that, it stifles competition. {time} 1000 You stifle competition, it raises the cost. Who is paying the extra cost? The American taxpayer. It creates, or potentially creates, contracting and construction delays. We don't need any more delays at the VA. I think we have been through that plenty of times. Now, we just want to get the best price. We want everybody involved. We want everybody able to bid and able to participate. Let the government, let the taxpayer get the best job for the best price. Under this amendment, PLAs for military construction would not be forbidden. They are still not forbidden; they are just not mandated. Again, this amendment simply allows none of the funds made by the executive order to be used to implement or enforce Executive Order 13502. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The DOD does a lot of construction projects--this bill is certainly a testament to that--and these are often complex projects. They build facilities that are used to repair ships or store munitions, and usually when we read about large, complex construction projects, it is often in the context of delays or cost overruns or concerns on the workforce front. Folks want to see local opportunities on local projects. Now, a project labor agreement allows Federal agencies to negotiate exclusively with the building trades to ensure both union and open shop contractors are able to participate on the project. The agreement establishes quality worksite conditions and works to ensure construction is finished on time and under budget. When executed properly, PLAs are flexible, and they encourage participation from a wide variety of prime and subcontractors. In fact, PLAs are used on big, private projects. Look at every significant hotel project, casino project, stadium project. I worked professionally in economic development before I came here. These project labor agreements were vital to seeing projects happen. Why? Because they save money and because they keep projects on schedule and because they use local workers. You have seen the first project labor agreement in Navy history in my district--just one, mind you. What is the [[Page H2855]] outcome? Well, the project is going to be completed at a cost of $250 million below what was originally projected. With a contract that was worked out ahead of time, it meant that local workers were assigned on the front end. They brought in quality workers, local workers, and that strengthens our local communities. By partnering with local trades and using apprenticeship programs, this is helping to grow the next generation of tradespeople, giving opportunities to veterans and to women and minority communities. So it means that we are not just building a wharf in my district; it means we are building the next generation of workers. We are building the middle class. When you compare this with similar large, complex projects, the project that we just had with a project labor agreement had fewer problems and will deliver more value for taxpayers. So I do not understand why we would take this valuable tool out of our toolbox. We should be encouraging these efforts. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I just want to state I have no objection to the gentleman's amendment. The Department of Defense has awarded one construction contract, that is the explosives-handling wharf in Kitsap, Washington--I believe, in the gentleman's district--where the solicitation favored PLAs. The Department of Veterans Affairs has not awarded any contracts that have used PLAs, and they currently have no solicitations that favor PLAs. That said, I am very sympathetic with the gentleman's amendment, and I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I am very disappointed that, instead of seeking to pass the most bipartisan bill possible, my colleagues would prefer to weigh down the bill that funds veterans and military construction with a divisive rider. PLAs can be an essential tool to allow large projects to be completed on time and on budget. They are a benefit to both employers and employees. A project labor agreement provides a single collective bargaining unit, which allows for easier management of a project. They provide a reliable and uninterrupted supply of workers. They provide uniform wages, uniform benefits, overtime pay. A PLA sets the terms and conditions of employment for all workers onsite, including the work conditions and the rules. In addition, a PLA prohibits strikes and work stoppages. It is insulting that some would seek to prevent the use of PLAs on this bill when it is one of the best tools available to guarantee that veterans are hired as skilled construction workers. The use of a PLA does not prevent nonunion small businesses from participating. They have to agree to the terms and to sign on to the PLA. In addition, the PLA does not make the project union only. Simply put, project labor agreements help both the government and the private sector increase the efficiency and the quality of its project by promoting a business model that employs a highly skilled workforce. Such a workforce ensures that construction projects are built correctly the first time, on time and, as a result, on budget. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. I would note that this House has repeatedly refused to adopt similar amendments on this bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 30 seconds remaining. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate that this does not take this tool out of the toolbox. It just doesn't require it. With all due respect to those who say, well, it stops strikes from happening and it makes sure it is on time and on budget, a simple contract that millions of Americans sign every single day without a project labor agreement does that already. If project labor agreements are necessary, why aren't we all doing it with the work on our homes or the work on our businesses? The fact is it is not done everywhere because it is not necessary. The fact is it discourages participation, because you can participate if you want to join the union, or at least de facto join the union because you are going to do everything by the union code, every single thing, all your employees, all your representation. I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross). Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, let's start out by talking about some of the facts, because I hear some talking points from those who are trying to disturb and remove all workers' rights. There is nothing that currently is in place that mandates project labor agreements be used. If so, we would have thousands and thousands of them. It makes them permissible when a large and complex job would benefit from a precontract agreement, because that is what we are talking about. We are not talking about building a house or renovating a bedroom. Large, complex projects, that is what we are talking about. All it talks about is, before you sign a contract, make sure that you spell out very specifically the issues that could come up germane to that job. I have negotiated in my past life over 100 of these. Why? Because employers understand that this is to their benefit. There is a better cost ratio balance when they do a project labor agreement. They are public jobs, they are private jobs where nobody is mandating everything or anything. What we are saying here is that entering into a project labor agreement does one very important thing that nobody quite remembers here: Helmets to Hardhats, taking our veterans who served our country, giving them an opportunity to come home, put their uniform away, and go to work on a construction project. That alone is worth its weight in gold, and that is what Helmets to Hardhats does under a project labor agreement. It creates and allows that next generation of construction workers, those skilled craftsmen, to be part of that. Not one dime of that apprenticeship program comes from the government. This works. Why does it work? Because it saves money. The employer likes it because there are less headaches on the job, and it is probably the most important tool that could be in that worker's toolbox, to make sure that they level the playing field for a quality job that comes in on time and under budget. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be postponed. Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in contravention of subchapter III of chapter 20 of title 38, United States Code. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentlewoman from Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer the Jackson Lee amendment that clearly recognizes the importance of those who have served and [[Page H2856]] their lives after. My amendment says none of the funds made available by this act for the Department of Veterans Affairs may be used in contravention of subchapter III of chapter 20 of title 38 of the U.S. Code, which refers to the benefits for homeless veterans in training and outreach programs. Texas and Florida and California happen to be some of the States that have the highest number of homeless veterans. These are individuals who put on the uniform unselfishly. Now they are homeless for a variety of reasons. I hope that this amendment will reinforce and reemphasize the importance of ensuring that the rate of homelessness among veterans in the United States does not increase. As well, my amendment will remind us of our obligation to provide our veterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which includes adequate funding for programs like the Veterans Administration Supportive Housing that provides case management services, adequate housing facilities, mental health support, and addresses other issues that contribute to veterans' homelessness. I have, on my staff, a wounded warrior. We work a lot with homeless veterans. We visit their centers. We provide them with a sense that their commitment to this Nation will never be forgotten. Today in our country there are approximately 107,000 veterans, male and female, who are homeless on any given night, and perhaps twice as many, 200,000, experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year. I remember dealing with one of my nonprofits that was renting a space just to help three or four or five veterans. Unfortunately, the landlord was not sensitive to the fact that he did not have all the moneys to pay his rent. He was ultimately evicted. But it wasn't just he who was evicted, who was trying to be the Good Samaritan, it was veterans who called that place home. Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because of their poverty and lack of support from their family. In my hometown of Houston, for example, we have had large numbers of homeless veterans, but we have begun to work on it. I hope that this amendment will remind people of supportive service programs, residential rehabilitation programs, and HUD VA programs. I ask support of my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I do not oppose the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman has offered the amendment in previous years, and we have accepted it. I have no objection to it being included again in the bill this year. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the distinguished ranking member and a strong supporter of veterans and leadership on the MILCON bill. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I just want to let my voice be heard to congratulate the gentlewoman on her amendment. It has been adopted previously by this House. I think it is a great amendment. We support our homeless veterans. I congratulate the gentlewoman for offering the amendment. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, let me thank Mr. Dent and Mr. Bishop for their leadership, and certainly the appropriators, the full committee chairman and ranking member, on the tasks that they have before them. We are not going to end homelessness for veterans if we do not invest in programs that will help them. My amendment is to ensure that we are reminded that these veterans can be rehabilitated and can be provided a new pathway in life. It is simply a continuing way to say thank you. Whenever I speak before veterans, whenever I speak before the United States military, I remind them--though they do not need to be reminded--that they unselfishly put on the uniform without question. They put on the uniform without question, and they followed orders. They followed the orders of the Commander in Chief. So now I hope that we, as Members of Congress, will follow orders and increase investment in the HUD-VASH program allocated to communities with the highest numbers of homeless veterans, support all council agencies to promote and give incentives to local coordination or plans and have our local communities own these plans so that they will bring down the cost of homelessness or the size of homelessness to prevent or to provide, if you will, for the homeownership that is so very important that our veterans desire. {time} 1015 But the most important point is, why don't we stand and salute and stand at attention and say to our veterans: we hear you. Homelessness must not exist among our veterans. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. It reminds us of funding for veterans who are homeless, as well as for programs for veterans who are homeless. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. It is Jackson Lee Amendment No. 350. Thank you for this opportunity to describe my amendment, which simply provides that: ``None of the funds made available by this Act for the Department of Veteran Affairs--Benefits for Homeless Veterans and Training and Outreach Programs may be used in contravention of the title 38, Part II, Chapter 20, Subchapter II and III of the U.S. Code This amendment will help ensure that the rate of homelessness among veterans in the United States does not increase. I thank Subcommittee Chairman Dent and Ranking Member Bishop for their hard work in shepherding this important legislation to the floor. I offer the Jackson Lee Amendment because I believe reducing and eliminating homelessness among veterans, those who risked their lives to protect our freedom, should also be one of the nation's highest priorities. Homelessness among the American veteran population is on the rise in the United States and we must be proactive in giving back to those who have given so much to us. My amendment will help remind us of our obligation to provide our veterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which includes adequately funding for programs Veterans Administration Supportive Housing (VASH) that provide case-management services, adequate housing facilities, mental health support, and address other areas that contribute to veteran homelessness. VASH is a jointly-administered permanent supportive housing program for disabled Veterans experiencing homelessness in which VA medical Centers provide referrals and case management while Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) administer the Section 8 housing vouchers. Mr. Chair, our veterans deserve the best services available, and I believe that we could be doing much more for them. Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male and female) who are homeless on any given night. And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year. Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because of their poverty, lack of support from family and friends, and dismal living conditions in cheap hotels or in overcrowded or substandard housing. While significant progress has been made, ending homelessness among veterans remains a big challenge. In my hometown of Houston for example, between the years 2010 and 2012, the number of homeless veterans increased from 771 to 1,162. We must remain vigilant and continue to fight for those who put on the uniform and fought for us. Providing a home for veterans to come home to every night is the very least we can do. Mr. Chair, programs like VASH have succeeded in changing lives. In 2012 alone, 35,905 veterans lived in the public housing provided by VASH. I have seen the impact of such grants in my home state of Texas, and within my congressional district in Houston, and I am sure that this funding has positively impacted many communities across this country. In Texas, there are committed groups in Houston, working to eradicate the issue of homelessness. [[Page H2857]] For example, the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center has been involved in changing veterans' lives in a mighty way by providing Veterans and their families with access to affordable housing and medical services that will help them get back on their feet. Mr. Chair, we cannot let this issue of homelessness continue. I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee Amendment and commit ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran homelessness in America. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Gibson Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to enforce VA Adjudication Procedure Manual M21-1, Part IV, Subpart ii, Chapter 1, Section H, Topic 28.h related to Developing Claims Based on Service Aboard Ships Offshore the RVN. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the Parliamentarian and the chairman and the ranking member. Earlier this morning, I offered this amendment and it needed to be perfected. I greatly appreciate the staff and the work of the team here so that we could get this in a form to where it certainly meets muster. This is a very important amendment. Half a century ago, our Nation was embroiled in a war in Vietnam. It divided the Nation. But for our young men and women who went forward and fought on our behalf, their loyalties were never divided. They did everything that they could every day to serve our Nation in a very difficult circumstance. What developed over that time were soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who became sick. They were exposed to Agent Orange. This was part of that war. Our Nation had chosen to defoliate as a means of protecting troops with Agent Orange. But what we learned over time is that there was a direct link between exposure to Agent Orange and nine maladies, including cancer, diabetes and Parkinson's. This body, in 1991, recognizing this, came together with the President of the United States and enacted the Agent Orange Act of 1991. Unfortunately, in 2002, there was an overreach on the part of the executive that narrowed that interpretation. And since that time, Members here on both sides of the aisle have been fighting to ensure that our sailors who served just offshore in Vietnam got access to the health care that they desperately need. Mr. Chairman, over half of these sailors who were exposed are already in Heaven. They are gone now. And for those that are left here, time is of the essence. It is an urgent matter that we get this passed. Three hundred twenty of my colleagues agree with this on both sides of the aisle, and about half the Senate. So today, we offer this amendment to reassert our article I prerogatives to ensure that, for every serviceman and woman that goes forward, that they know that, regardless of the difficulty of the fight and the difficulty of the proposition and what it may mean for the politics here in America, we will never turn our back on our servicemen and -women. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Announcement by the Chair The CHAIR. The Chair will remind Members to turn off cell phones when they enter the House Chamber. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, but I am not opposed. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, we support the amendment. We appreciate the good work that my friend from New York (Mr. Gibson) has done to advocate on behalf of all veterans, and particularly his commitment to helping those who suffered from Agent Orange exposure, as well as many other issues. So I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chair, I deeply appreciate the support of the chairman and ranking member, and I respectfully request the support of the House on this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gibson). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment Offered by Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec.__. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used in contravention of Executive Order No. 13672 of July 21, 2014 (``Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity''). The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last night, this House adopted a provision as part of the defense bill that rolls back antidiscrimination provisions contained in executive orders issued by the President in recent years. This is one of the ugliest episodes I have experienced in my 3-plus years as a Member of this House. The inclusion of such hate-based language in a defense bill designed to support our military sends exactly the wrong message at a time when we should all be unified in supporting the efforts of our servicemembers around the world. My father was a veteran. He was nearly killed in the service of his country. I have never voted against a defense bill before. I never thought I would. Almost a quarter of the constituents I represent in the Hudson Valley of New York come from families where a member is serving in the military or has served in the military. I represent the United States Military Academy at West Point. We have helped 800 veterans, one at a time, out of my district office in my 3 years in Congress, and we have passed legislation directly aimed at making their lives better. So, it is not with an easy heart that I come to the House floor and oppose the defense bill, but this legislation snuck into the bill--and was kept in the bill--despite a bipartisan effort to remove it, sends exactly the wrong signal and it says that we are so concerned about discriminating against a group of LGBT Americans that we are willing to destroy the bipartisan cooperation we should have on the defense bill. So my amendment today gives us another chance. It gives us a chance to correct some of the damage done last night by some Members of this body. What it would say is quite simple: we shall not do anything in this bill that contravenes the antidiscrimination executive orders of the President. It is pretty simple. We should not be spending taxpayer dollars to promote hate, and we should not be justifying that by some religious exemption, when, in fact, the language in the defense bill simply rolls back the antidiscrimination provisions that the President put in an executive order to those contained in the original Civil Rights Act and the ADA. It is specifically designed to exclude LGBT Americans. And in doing that, it aligns itself with the parallel efforts we see happening in States like North Carolina. It is wrong and it doesn't have anything to do with our military; it doesn't have anything to do with fighting ISIS; it doesn't have anything to do with religious protections. It is about bigotry, plain and simple. Today, we have another chance to do the right thing and to send the right message and to stick up for our military. [[Page H2858]] Mr. DENT. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. DENT. I support the amendment, and I certainly oppose discrimination in any way, shape, or form, particularly as, in this case, it relates to Federal contracting. I do support the amendment. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Reclaiming my time, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and I want to acknowledge that it was the gentleman from Pennsylvania, together with Mr. Hanna from New York, who courageously led the effort to roll back the discrimination in a bipartisan way in the Rules Committee. And that effort was thwarted. So I am very honored by the gentleman's support, and I am honored by the position you have taken in this House over the last couple of days. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I do respect the gentleman for his right to come and offer under an open rule, in a different bill, his objections to what occurred last night. Last night, the House of Representatives passed the bill. And today, the gentleman is offering a limiting amendment that would turn back that agreement that we made. Mr. Chairman, several days ago, the House Armed Services Committee handled this issue. It was not sneaking something in. It was a straight-up vote. It was a vote that was held in the Armed Services Committee, it passed. The final vote was 60-2. Mr. Chairman, that is a bipartisan vote. That is a vote from people on the committee who viewed that they were not going to let one issue or another get in the way of supporting the men and women of our United States military. They very clearly--all of them on the committee-- understood during this long markup exactly the implications, and they lived with the decision. I am here today to say that the gentleman is fully entitled to do as he is doing, but the vote was held last night. The overwhelming viewpoint was let's support the United States military and let's get this done, not the next day come on the floor with spilled milk on your face and say: I want to go back and I want to relitigate a decision that we made last night with every Member here on the floor. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the gentleman. I admire the gentleman. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Well, I appreciate the admiration. Let me ask my colleague: Is it necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians to support our military? Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, that issue was handled--and the gentleman knows this--in committee. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. It was resolved last night. It was resolved last night in the affirmative. In other words, this House said that it would include in a defense bill a provision that would roll back basic employment questions for gays and lesbians. My question to my colleague is simply, Mr. Chairman, if that is necessary for the promotion of national defense. Is it necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians and transgender Americans to keep our country safe? Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the gentleman. I am not without an understanding that there are people who do have ideas which override other bigger ideas. I am simply saying to you, Mr. Chairman, I stand in opposition to what the gentleman is attempting to do here, the next day, in a separate bill, to limit what we did last night, when this body did understand that many people have a strong viewpoint that supports the gentleman, and more people have a viewpoint that is against that. That is not my point. My point is, we need to transcend that as a body. And we did last night. We spoke very clearly. We need to support the men and women of the United States military. And we do not believe this is a stumbling block because we don't view what the gentleman is saying is the critical and key issue. That is why I stand in opposition to what the gentleman is doing. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my time. The CHAIR. Is there an objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? Mr. SESSIONS. Objection. The CHAIR. Objection is heard. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney). Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I would like to again express my thanks for my colleague's admiration. It is nice to have admiration. It is better to have rights and it is better to be treated equally and without condescension. I would just note, Mr. Chairman, that the question remains unanswered of whether it is necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians in Federal contracting to protect our country, to support our troops? Is it necessary to remove employment protections in employers covering 28 million Americans so that we can fight the war on ISIS? Is it necessary to protect ourselves in our houses of worship by discriminating in Federal contracting in businesses that are in the business of commerce and in private contracting? It is a tired and old and false choice to suggest that we need to discriminate to keep ourselves safe, to keep ourselves free. And people in earlier times have made those arguments, and they have, one after another, been reversed. So the notion that because this House did it last night, it can't get it right today, is at odds with a lot of American history. This House got a lot of things wrong for a lot of people for a lot of years. And then finally, slowly, almost despite ourselves, we figured out that we can be safe and free and equal. And in fact, becoming more equal in some ways makes us safer because it is the promotion of our values through our actions and our ideas and our words, not just our weapons that promote our values around the world. {time} 1030 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his kindness. I want to briefly join in the gentleman's recounting of our history, and I want to remind people of the eloquent statement of the Attorney General, Attorney General Lynch, who indicated that civil rights is a very large tent, and it embraces all Americans. Whether it is religious freedom or religious rights, or whether it is civil rights issues dealing with the race and ethnicity of Americans, we have always overcome. I believe that the men and women of the United States military deserve better than to have the kind of poisonous amendments that undermine the very reason that they put on the uniform, for us to be free, to speak freely, to associate, and to stand as who we are. I am saddened because my history is a reminder that I did not stand equal in this Nation, either as a woman or an African American, or even as an immigrant, which my grandparents were. So I join in pleading with this House to not, in any way, strip us of civil rights and tear up the Constitution, the 14th Amendment, the Fifth Amendment of due process. That would be shame on us. I join the gentleman in his amendment, and I ask that we consider those who we like and who we dislike. They are Americans, and they deserve the right to be respected under the law. I would ask that the gentleman's amendment be accepted, voted on, respected; and let us be the Americans that our Constitution dictates and our flag says we are. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney). [[Page H2859]] The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR.

B. Johnson, Sam Salmon Swalwell (CA) Takai {time} 1132 So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the last three lines of the bill. The Clerk read as follows: This Act may be cited as the ``Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017''. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise and report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4974) making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, directed him to report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. For what purpose does the gentleman from Maryland, the minority whip, seek recognition? Parliamentary Inquiry Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HOYER. I want to raise a parliamentary inquiry, initially, with reference to the fact that Mr. Ryan, our Speaker, has told us that, if people were in the well, the vote would be held open. I was standing in the well. No one came or no one had the courage to come into the well to change their vote. But notwithstanding that, the vote kept changing. Mr. Speaker, from a parliamentary perspective, how is that possible? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair may not yet have made a request for changes. Mr. HOYER. I saw no one come to the desk to change their vote, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman have a parliamentary inquiry? Mr. HOYER. The parliamentary inquiry is: How can the vote change when [[Page H2866]] no one comes to the well to change their vote? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair may not yet have made a request for changes. Mr. HOYER. I didn't hear the Chair request change. But I do know that, from my own personal observation, not one of those Members who apparently changed their vote--because it kept changing on the board-- came to this well and had the courage to change from green to red or red to green. How is that possible, Mr. Speaker? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has not stated a parliamentary inquiry. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The question is on the amendments. The amendments were agreed to. Parliamentary Inquiry Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I did not hear and, therefore, was not able to ask for a recorded vote on the motion to rise. The Speaker did not articulate that so the House could hear it, and I request a vote on the motion to rise. Now, the Speaker may tell me we are past that point, but the fact of the matter is, nobody on this House floor heard the Speaker articulate the issue of whether the Committee ought to rise. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The House is definitely past that point. Is the gentleman seeking a recorded vote? Mr. HOYER. On the motion to rise, yes, sir. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has put the question on the adoption of the amendments. Mr. HOYER. I ask for a recorded vote on the adoption of the amendment. Which amendment is the Speaker talking about? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has put the question on the amendments reported from the Committee of the Whole. Mr. HOYER. Yes, I do. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A recorded vote is requested. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my request for a recorded vote. It is my understanding that because the amendment was defeated, magically, without anybody coming to the well to change their vote, by giving to the majority the right to have the ability, without coming to the well and telling America that you were going to change a vote. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's request is withdrawn. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Recorded Vote Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 241, noes 183, not voting 9, as follows: [Roll No. 227] AYES--241 Abraham Aderholt Allen Amash Amodei Babin Barletta Barr Barton Benishek Bilirakis Bishop (MI) Bishop (UT) Black Blackburn Blum Bost Boustany Brady (TX) Brat Bridenstine Brooks (AL) Brooks (IN) Buck Bucshon Burgess Byrne Calvert Carter (GA) Carter (TX) Chabot Chaffetz Clawson (FL) Coffman Cole Collins (GA) Collins (NY) Comstock Conaway Cook Costello (PA) Cramer Crawford Crenshaw Culberson Curbelo (FL) Davis, Rodney Denham Dent DeSantis DesJarlais Diaz-Balart Dold Donovan Duffy Duncan (SC) Duncan (TN) Ellmers (NC) Emmer (MN) Farenthold Fincher Fitzpatrick Fleischmann Fleming Flores Forbes Fortenberry Foxx Franks (AZ) Frelinghuysen Garrett Gibbs Gibson Gohmert Goodlatte Gosar Gowdy Granger Graves (GA) Graves (LA) Graves (MO) Griffith Grothman Guinta Guthrie Hanna Hardy Harper Harris Hartzler Heck (NV) Hensarling Hice, Jody B.

reserved. the clerk will continue to read. the clerk continued to read. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 736, the gentleman from washington and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from washington. mr. heck of washington. mr. chairman, i actually plan on withdrawing my amendment, but would like to make my colleagues aware of some amazing work being done in my district on behalf of veterans and wounded warriors. mr. chairman, millions--millions--of people watched the u.s. open at chambers bay in washington's 10th congressional district last june. it showcased, frankly, the irreplaceable beauty of golf in the pacific northwest. but just a 10-minute drive from chambers bay, you will also find yourself at beautiful american lake. at american lake, that is where veterans recover and heal from injuries at the va facility, which is located near joint base lewis- mcchord. a big part of that recuperation includes a bit of tlc from another golf course in addition to chambers bay. since 1955, 61 years, nine holes of golf at the american lake veterans golf course is where south sound veterans could escape the stresses of their daily lives and engage in some healthy competition. and let's be honest, it is hard to look forward to a visit to the doctor, but looking forward to a round of golf with your buddies is something entirely different. it has become a great way for older vets to connect with younger vets for more recent conflicts. currently, american lake veterans golf course--it is important that you hear this--is the nation's only golf course designed specifically for the rehabilitation of wounded and disabled veterans. almost all of the dedicated volunteers there are veterans as well. well, except one, and his name is jack nicklaus--yes, that jack nicklaus--the ``golden bear,'' widely regarded, perhaps, as the greatest golfer of our time, who now spends his time actually designing golf courses. he is the one who helped design and expand the american lake veterans golf course to include a back nine. they went from nine holes to 18. the back nine is now in place, and the course is waiting for va secretary mcdonald to sign the necessary paperwork to formally accept the course improvements. the course exists because of the determination of hardworking volunteers--really angels among us. and now it is time to honor one of those committed volunteers for his commitment to our veterans and wounded warriors, and officially designate holes 10 through 18 as the nicklaus nine. with the nicklaus nine, we will now have an 18-hole, 100 percent ada accessible golf course to accommodate returning troops and our local combat veterans. with the nicklaus nine, we will have double the accessibility and green to offer our veterans who have given so much to all of us. now, i am going to tell you a story, and i guarantee it is going to stay with you, i guarantee that you are going to remember this story. there is a program at american lake veterans golf course that teaches blind veterans how to play golf. one year, we had a local golfer--his name happens to be ray reed--who was sent to the national blind golf tournament in iowa. ray reed, blind, wounded warrior. and do you know what he did at that national golf tournament? he scored a hole in one. yes, blind veterans can golf, and they learn how to do that at american lake. it is incredible. they are an inspiration to all of us. mr. chairman, to avoid a point of order on my amendment, i would like to withdraw it at this time. but i hope that i can work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find another vehicle, or a standalone bill, to get this done. i strongly believe it to be appropriate to honor and bestow on he who has changed the name of golf, the golden bear, this honor for changing the lives of wounded warriors. i hope this will encourage the design and development of more golf courses around the u.s. devoted to our veterans and our wounded warriors. with that, mr. chairman, i thank my colleagues. mr. chair, i ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. the chair. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from washington? there was no objection. the chair. the amendment is withdrawn. amendment offered by mr. gibson mr. gibson. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will report the amendment. the clerk read as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the following: sec. __. none of the funds made available for this act may be used by the department of veterans affairs to preclude the territorial seas of the republic of vietnam from inclusion in the meaning of the republic of vietnam under the agent orange act of 1991 (public law 102-4) and the amendments made by that act. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 736, the gentleman from new york and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from new york. mr. dent. mr. chairman, i reserve a point of order on the gentleman's amendment. the chair. a point of order is reserved. mr. gibson. mr. chair, i am here this morning to bring forward an amendment that is for our sailors who fought in the vietnam war. this is about ensuring they get the health care and the benefits that they have earned through their service in vietnam. but in a broader sense, this is really about justice. this is about veterans who went forward and fought that war, a deeply unpopular war that divided our nation. they were never asked [[page h2850]] about their political leanings or what their views were on the war. they simply did what they were ordered to do. they went forward and they gave their very best effort to serve us. in the process of that war, we used agent orange to defoliate. in the case of these sailors, serving just offshore in vietnam, we had ships that were involved in resupply operations at the ports and at the harbor, and they were vulnerable. they were vulnerable because there was vegetation near the ports and the harbors. as our countermeasure to that, we defoliated to give standoff for those ships to protect them. but what we have learned over time, mr. chairman, is that that was poisoning our sailors, and anyone that was in close proximity. now, and in fact in 1991, this body, along with the senate and the president of the united states of america, enacted a law, the agent orange act of 1991, that ensured that our veterans who were exposed to agent orange had access to the health care and the benefits that they had earned. regrettably, in 2002, executive overreach led to a rule that narrowed the interpretation of our law. now it is so that you have to have served on the ground in vietnam or in the riverine navy to get access to this law and to these benefits. mr. chairman, the people's representatives never spoke on that. this is an issue we have dealt with time and again in this chamber, both sides of the aisle, fighting back, fighting for our article i prerogatives. and this is very clear here. this body spoke. we said we had to try to make right what was wrong. so now we have about 90,000 sailors that don't have access to health care. mr. chairman, be advised and be assured that members of this body fight every day for these veterans in a case-by-case basis, and we do win some of these, but we don't win all of them. it is just flatly wrong. mr. chairman, what this amendment does is really ensure that our article i prerogatives are secured. that we go back to the original language that we passed and the president signed. i would ask all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. i reserve the balance of my time. point of order mr. dent. mr. chairman, i insist on my point of order. the chair. the gentleman will state his point of order. mr. dent. mr. chair, i make a point of order against this amendment. although it is a very well-intended amendment, and i am very sympathetic to what he wants to do, i think there might be a way, if the gentleman withdraws and tries to perfect that amendment, that it might be made in order. this amendment proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule xxi. the rule states in pertinent part: ``an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.'' the bill gives direction to that effect. i ask for a ruling from the chair. again, i would ask my colleague to consider withdrawing and see if he can perfect that amendment so that it would be made in order. the chair. does any other member wish to be heard on the point of order? mr. gibson. mr. chairman, i just want to say, i have the deepest respect for the chairman, a dear colleague and friend. but i have to say that i am astounded that we would talk about a point of order here when we are talking about our language. this is what we passed. what we saw is that the executive branch, with fiat, changed what it is that we passed. so i don't know how it is that we are legislating to their executive overreach. this is merely an amendment that goes back to our language. and it is not just me standing here today; 320 of our colleagues in the united states house of representatives, on both sides of the aisle, believe that this needs to get done. and nearly half of the senate, an exact companion, also believe that. now, because of our friendship and because of the way that we have worked together, i just want to enter into a colloquy and get clarification from the chairman. what i think i heard him say moments ago is that, if i withdraw, he will work with us so that we can reassert our article i powers and ensure that we have justice for these vietnam veterans who deserve these benefits. can i get that clarification from the chairman? the chair. the chair will hear each member individually on the point of order. a point of order is pending. the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized to be heard on the point of order. mr. dent. mr. chair, on the point of order, the point i am trying to make is this: if the amendment is withdrawn, it can be reworked so that it would be in order. we believe that there is a way to do that even today. that is the offer i am making to you. if the amendment is withdrawn, there is a possibility that this amendment could be made in order, but it does have to be perfected. i am a cosponsor of the actual underlying legislation, so i support it. but at the moment, in our view, it does constitute legislation in an appropriation bill, and, therefore, it violates clause 2 of rule xxi. but i pledge to work to the best of our ability to try to make it in order, even today, if possible. the chair. the gentleman from new york is recognized. mr. gibson. mr. chair, given the pledge of my dear friend from pennsylvania to work to make sure that we have justice and that we can move forward and help these veterans, i ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. the chair. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new york? there was no objection. the chair. the amendment is withdrawn. amendment offered by mr. gosar mr. gosar. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will report the amendment. the clerk read as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: sec. __. none of the funds made available by this act may be used for the veterans experience office. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 736, the gentleman from arizona and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from arizona. mr. gosar. mr. chairman, i rise to offer a simple amendment to prevent wasteful new administrative spending within the va general administration account, and to ensure that scarce resources are not diverted away from the priorities that need them most. my amendment will strengthen and support the position of this committee to ensure that none of the funds made available by this act may be used by the administration's proposed bureaucracy quagmire called the veterans experience office. while the name may make this proposed new nationwide office sound like a good idea, this proposal would unleash a new cadre of federal bureaucrats to stand between the veterans and their benefits, repeating those terrifying nine words, ``i'm from the government and i'm here to help.'' we all share the goal of improving each and every veteran's experience with the va. however, it would be foolish to permit the creation of a new general administration program that would siphon off more than $72 million away from the programs and offices prioritized by this committee as those most in need of support. i commend the committee for identifying this wasteful proposal in their report, stating, ``while the committee supports the secretary's efforts to improve the ways va interacts with veterans, it has doubts about the wisdom of establishing a large new office with regional staffing at this late date in the administration.'' while the position of the committee is clear, my amendment is necessary to ensure that the administration is prohibited from transferring limited funds within the general administration account to fund this unwise and duplicitous proposal. this administration is notorious for ignoring the will [[page h2851]] of congress and seeking out loopholes to advance the executive branch's agenda. this track record of rogue behavior is why this amendment is so necessary in order to carry out the committee's recommendation and properly care for our veterans. the va doesn't need more money to hire more people pushers to create an even larger bureaucracy between the veterans and their benefits. instead, let's ensure resources are allocated where they have the most effective and efficient benefit for those who have given their country so much. i ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. i thank chairman dent and ranking member bishop for their time. i reserve the balance of my time. {time} 0930 mr. dent. mr. chair, i claim the time in opposition, but i am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. the chair. without objection, the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. there was no objection. mr. dent. mr. chair, i understand the gentleman's concerns about starting this large, new office at the va. as you can see from our report, we cut the request for general administration by $81.3 million, largely because of our concerns about funding this large office; so i think we have already achieved what the gentleman is looking to accomplish. it is hard to imagine that the va could find $81 million in another account to backfill this office. i will not oppose the gentleman's amendment. i will tell the gentleman, however, that this will inevitably become a conference issue because the senate supports the creation of the office. i do not object to the amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chair, i move to strike the last word. the chair. the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chair, the bulk of the request of the increase for the general administration was intended for the establishment of the veterans experience office. up until now, the veterans experience office's activities have been funded through the office of enterprise integration. however, the fy 2017 budget proposes to make the veterans experience office a standalone office within the general administration and requests $72.6 million in funding and 204 full-time equivalents via direct budget authority. while we all support the secretary's efforts to improve the way the va interacts with the veterans, we had doubts about the wisdom of establishing a large, new office with regional staffing at this late date in the administration. it was decided not to include this funding. however, there is nothing in the bill that prevents the secretary from continuing to fund the office in the way that he did in the previous fiscal year. conversely, the amendment before us will prevent this office from being funded, period. i believe that the amendment is a bridge too far. while i don't support making the veterans experience office a free- standing office, i also don't support taking the secretary's flexibility away either. i believe that the bill is the right approach. i urge members to oppose the amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. gosar. mr. chair, i rebut. this president and his agencies have shown time and time again that they are eager to ignore the will of congress and to implement his agenda wherever they can. this is a necessary reminder that the va is hardly a vestibule of good behavior. i think we need to make them concentrate on doing their procedures right that they currently cannot do right. i urge members to accept my amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona (mr. gosar). the amendment was agreed to. amendment offered by mr. gosar mr. gosar. mr. chair, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will report the amendment. the clerk read as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: sec. __. none of the funds made available by this act may be used to-- (1) carry out the memorandum from the veterans benefit administration known as fast letter 13-10, issued on may 20, 2013; or (2) create or maintain any patient record-keeping system other than those currently approved by the department of veterans affairs central office in washington, d.c. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 736, the gentleman from arizona and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from arizona. mr. gosar. mr. chair, i offer an amendment. i have offered similar amendments in the last 2 years, and they have passed each time. i had hoped that it would not be necessary to offer this amendment again this year. unfortunately, an investigation from the government accountability office that was released last month found that the va schedulers are still manipulating appointment wait times and are underestimating how long veterans have to wait to get care at a va facility. the gao's most recent audit found that schedulers changed dates and shortened wait times for 15 to 20 percent of the cases reviewed. to make matters worse, usa today recently claimed to have studied more than 70 investigative reports, and it found that these manipulations were being performed at the behest of the va supervisors. last year, a different inspector general investigation uncovered an actual memo from the va leadership that encouraged this type of behavior. the memo i speak of is known as the fast letter 13-10, and it was handed down directly from the office of the director of the veterans benefits administration to the philadelphia va regional benefit office. i was appalled--but not totally surprised--to learn of this memo. the need for my amendment first surfaced 2 years ago as a response to explosive allegations about the phoenix va's keeping secondary, unofficial records of claims and appointment requests. my commonsense amendment simply prohibits the va from keeping unofficial recordkeeping systems and manipulating wait times. i have said this before, but it is sad that we have to pass amendments to prevent this type of behavior. when government bureaucrats don't use good judgment or common sense, congress must address these issues. we must have one consistent patient recordkeeping system within the va in order to provide accountability, uniformity, and to prevent employee manipulation. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. i thank chairman dent and ranking member bishop for their time. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. dent. mr. chair, i claim the time in opposition, but i am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. the chair. without objection, the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. there was no objection. mr. dent. mr. chair, this amendment is familiar to us since the gentleman offered it last year. i am not sure it is necessary to repeat the language this year since we know the va has rescinded the fast letter guidance. after all, with the ig investigation into the dual scheduling systems, it doesn't seem likely that the va is maintaining recordkeeping systems that are not approved by headquarters; but i am not going to object to the amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. gosar. i thank the gentleman. mr. chair, we want to reward good behavior, and until they illustrate good behavior, the amendment is going forward. i appreciate the chairman's support. i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona (mr. gosar). the amendment was agreed to. amendment no. 7 offered by mr. mica mr. mica. mr. chair, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: sec. __. (a) for an additional amount for ``veterans health administration--medical services'' for grants to states under subchapter iii of chapter 81 of title 38, united states code, to expand, remodel, or alter existing buildings for furnishing nursing home [[page h2852]] care to veterans in state homes that are former nursing home facilities of the department of veterans affairs, as authorized by section 8133 of such subchapter, there is hereby appropriated, and the amount otherwise provided by this act for ``departmental administration--general administration'' is hereby reduced by, $10,000,000. (b) none of the funds made available by this act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce the prioritization requirements in paragraphs (1)(c) or (2) through (5) of section 8135(c) of title 38, united states code, with respect to the appropriation in subsection (a). the chair. pursuant to house resolution 736, the gentleman from florida and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from florida. mr. mica. mr. chair, this is a simple amendment. i get to chair a subcommittee called transportation and public assets. we get to oversee, in the public assets portion, all of the various properties around the united states that are public assets that are sitting idle. for example, in some states we have many va properties that are medical--some hospitals, some nursing homes--that are sitting idle. some of them are vacant, and some of them are closed. in order to put them into productive use for our veterans, i have tried to craft an amendment that, of course, doesn't apply to all of the facilities. i would like to do that, but this is fairly limited. it says that we have a nursing home that has been vacated or a nursing home that is not being used, and some of them, for several years, have sat vacant. this allows the secretary discretion, and it also sets aside a small number of funds to help bring that property into a condition so that it can be transferred to the state. you have these in pennsylvania, mr. chair. you have these across the rust belt. we have them even in florida. what we don't have is the authority for the va to move forward with these properties in their transferring and get the properties into condition and make the little bits of changes in the properties to transfer them to the states. this will apply to 49 states. there are 49 states that have state vas. many of them run nursing homes. in my state, for example, we run seven nursing homes now. we do it more cost-effectively. we can do it faster. we can take those idle assets and put them into use. in some places in the rust belt, you need to consolidate some of the facilities, and this will allow us to do that, too, and to run them cheaper and give better services to our veterans, not spread out the limited number of even staffers whom we have and administrators. think of what you can save just on that. this is an amendment to try to move that process forward. we are not trying to get ahead of anybody who is in line for any kind of a va facility. what we are trying to do is, again, tell the va secretary that he can move forward and put a little bit of money aside that will make a big, big difference with these facilities that are sitting vacant or half empty across the country, and it does apply to 49 states. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. dent. mr. chair, i claim the time in opposition, but i am not opposed to the gentleman's amendment. the chair. without objection, the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. there was no objection. mr. dent. mr. chair, i understand there is a great demand throughout our nation for state veterans' homes, and i wish we had the allocation to provide more for this program than we did. i do want to raise a concern with the language that it might--i say ``might.'' i am not saying ``definitely''--favor some states rather than increase funding for the entire state home program. i was pleased to hear the gentleman state that he is not trying to jump ahead of other states that may be in line, but this is an issue that we are going to have to discuss at the conference committee. i am not going to object to the amendment. mr. chair, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. mica. i appreciate that. mr. chair, i think if there are differences in language, we have tried to work with the parliamentarian and the committee, and i know you all are busy in trying to get a very important piece of legislation out, but this small amendment can make a big difference. again, this is in rust belt states, even in growing states like florida, and there is no more cost to the federal taxpayer in the operation. in fact, we will save money in the operation because the states take these over. and if the states take them over, it is one less burden on the va. we have seen how difficult it is sometimes to get services from the va, to have these facilities come on line. to the nursing home folks, listen to this. this is to nursing homes: we have a tremendously expanding, aging veterans' population, and we can't keep up with it all, and the federal government sometimes does it the least efficiently. this allows us to take those empty or half empty or partially used facilities and get them to the states, to sometimes consolidate the operations and save money on administration, operation, and expedite and get that service to our veterans as soon as possible. i urge the members' support of this small amendment. i will be glad to work with the chairman, with the ranking member, and with others and craft this in any way that they feel comfortable, but the objective is very important at this stage. i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from florida (mr. mica). the amendment was agreed to. amendment offered by mr. gosar mr. gosar. mr. chair, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will report the amendment. the clerk read as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: sec. __. none of the funds made available by this act may be used in contravention of sections 575.106 or 575.206 of title 5, code of federal regulations. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 736, the gentleman from arizona and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from arizona. mr. gosar. mr. chair, in a 2015 report from the va office of the inspector general, it was discovered and reported that two senior staff members used their positions of power to financially and personally benefit from unethical behavior. diana rubens and kimberly graves not only coerced two va managers to leave their positions against their will, they then manufactured circumstances that allowed for them to take the positions in question. to make matters worse, these women then took advantage of the va's relocation expense program. relocation bonuses may be given to current employees if an open position will be difficult to fill without such an incentive. in both of these instances, this clearly was not the case. in total, these women walked away with more than $400,000 in taxpayer funds. as if these actions weren't heinous enough, when the va did attempt to hold rubens and graves accountable, the va was subsequently overturned because they failed to discipline the other employees involved in this case. i am appalled--but ultimately, again, not surprised--to hear of this story. the va has been riddled with scandal and plagued with lawlessness for years now. chairman miller said it best in the days that followed the reversal of the va's decision, stating: ``every objective observer knows that the federal civil service system coddles and protects misbehaving employees instead of facilitating fair and efficient discipline; and until va and obama administration leaders acknowledge this problem and work with congress to solve it, it will never be fixed.'' mr. chair, my amendment is a commonsense approach that simply reaffirms the requirements in the code of federal regulations for employment incentives and relocation expenses. {time} 0945 had the va followed these regulations, diana rubens and kimberly graves wouldn't have been able to force two managers to leave and then get reimbursed for moving across the country to take their spots. i have said this before, but it is sad that we have to pass amendments to [[page h2853]] prevent this type of behavior. when government bureaucrats fail to serve the american people through the use of common sense, congress must address these issues personally. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. i thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their help. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. dent. mr. chair, i claim the time to speak in opposition, but i am not opposed to the amendment. the chair. without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. there was no objection. mr. dent. mr. chair, no one shares the gentleman's concerns more than i do about the inappropriate relocation incentive payments the va initially paid to two executives at the philadelphia regional office. the va has since reformed its policies, and i hope we will never ever hear again about such egregious staff misconduct and inappropriate reimbursements. however, i do think that the relocation incentive can be an important tool in some circumstances. although i have no objection to the gentleman's amendment, i think this may need to be refined a bit in conference to reflect the usefulness of the tool, when used appropriately. as i said, there was egregious misconduct in philadelphia, as the gentleman correctly points out. there is no question. in fact, many of us went and visited the philadelphia regional office at about that time for a hearing, both republicans and democrats, authorizers and appropriators, to discuss the challenges at that particular office. that said, i have no objection to the amendment. mr. bishop of georgia. will the gentleman yield? mr. dent. i yield to the gentleman. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chair, i have the deepest respect for the gentleman from pennsylvania and for the gentleman who is offering the amendment, but i think that we may be just going a little bit too far here. mr. chair, this amendment will restrict the ability of the va and the departments and related agencies funded in this act to use incentives to get experienced, talented, and capable individuals to take on difficult-to-fill positions. in other departments, they call these hardship posts. these are the jobs no one wants to do but are vital to the function of government. i think we can all agree that there are times when we need to provide incentives to those individuals whom we are asking to fill difficult jobs. at times, we need to take action to make a job more appealing, and sometimes we need to provide incentives to compete with the salaries that are typically paid outside of the federal government for some of the positions. i am concerned that this amendment will decrease the availability and quality of candidates possessing the competencies that are required for filling the hard-to-fill posts. we would not run a fortune 500 company this way. why are we limiting the ability of the u.s. government to recruit and hire the best and the brightest? i respectfully urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' mr. dent. mr. chair, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. gosar. mr. chair, trust is a series of promises kept, and it is very notable that the va has lost the trust of congress and the american people and, more importantly, our veterans. so until we get this right, until they can actually earn the respect and do the due diligence that they are expected to do for our veterans, it is a requirement of us to make sure, like a dog on a bone, to hold them accountable. i hope that everybody will vote for this amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona (mr. gosar). the amendment was agreed to. amendment offered by mr. gosar mr. gosar. mr. chair, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will report the amendment. the clerk read as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: sec. __. none of the funds made available by this act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce the exception in clause (iii) of section 1.218(a)(8) of title 38, code of federal regulations. mr. gosar (during the reading). mr. chair, i ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered as read. the chair. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from arizona? there was no objection. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 736, the gentleman from arizona and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from arizona. mr. gosar. mr. chair, recently, a veteran receiving care from the va contacted my office to express his concern about pro-union fliers being posted in va facilities. the veteran sent me a picture of one of these fliers, shown here for your reference. right here. as you can see, this flier is an attempt to recruit union activists. another flier, just above it, praises the agenda at the afl-cio. the veteran who contacted me was appalled that he was barraged by these pro-union advertisements during his visits to the va. i couldn't agree more. our nation's heros should not be subjected to blatantly partisan advertisements while trying to receive medical care at va facilities. my staff investigated this issue and found that, while solicitations like these are prohibited by law, union lobbyists were able to carve out a special exemption that allowed solicitation of labor organization membership or dues in va facilities. this is a blatant abuse of taxpayer-funded facilities for the purpose of pushing a pro-union agenda. given the obvious political nature of these groups, they should not be allowed to advertise in the va facilities. furthermore, the fact that va employees are engaging in union activities while on the clock is unacceptable, given the current state of the va. any time these employees spend time doing union activities is time they cannot spend treating our veterans. with a massive backlog of cases and the fact that veterans have literally died waiting for care, this abuse of taxpayer money and our veterans must be put to an end. for that reason, i introduced the amendment currently at the desk. my amendment will prohibit the use of funds to implement, administer, or enforce the current union loophole. defunding this exemption that allows unions to solicit members and dues at va facilities would place unions under the same regulatory framework as other 501(c)'s. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. i thank the distinguished chair and ranking member. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chair, i claim the time in opposition. the chair. the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chair, this is just another attack on organized labor and working people. the conduct that the gentleman wishes to prohibit is consistent with the national labor relations act, and it is consistent with the traditions of this country. it is freedom of speech, and i think it ought to be allowed. i certainly object to this. i think that the working people ought to have an opportunity to express themselves and utilize fully the first amendment, even in our va facilities. i couldn't imagine that people who support the constitution would want to muzzle working people and limit their ability to seek associations with like-minded people. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. gosar. mr. chair, once again, my amendment is critical to ensuring that our veterans receive the care they deserve in a nonpoliticized environment. again, this amendment idea came from a veteran who was outraged about the va being littered with union recruitment fliers. no veteran should be forced to endure blatantly partisan union advertisements in a taxpayer-funded building in order to receive the medical care they earned defending our country. we should all agree that the va employees should be spending their taxpayer-funded time treating veterans, not posting union fliers and negotiating for higher wages, especially given the va claims and the backlog of appeals that exist. i encourage adoption of the amendment. [[page h2854]] i also want to make sure that people understand that this amendment would create that the unions be treated as any other 501(c). i reserve the balance of my time. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chair, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. gosar. mr. chair, well, once again, we want to make sure that everybody is treated fairly about this. as you can see, the blatant attempt here about recruitment to the unions within our va is outright disgusting. we want to make sure that everybody is treated fairly and has the opportunity for fair speech, but this gives a hand up to the unions. i ask all my colleagues to vote for this amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chair, again, this is another nasty rider. this is a rider that is totally unnecessary and inappropriate on this bill. it violates the constitution. it certainly limits the rights of people in veterans facilities to be able to have freedom of speech and freedom of association. it is a bad proposition. i urge my colleagues to oppose it. i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona (mr. gosar). the question was taken; and the chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chair, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona will be postponed. amendment offered by mr. perry mr. perry. mr. chair, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will report the amendment. the clerk read as follows: at the end of the bill, before the short title, add the following new section: sec. __. none of the funds made available by this act may be used to implement or enforce executive order 13502. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 736, the gentleman from pennsylvania and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from pennsylvania. mr. perry. mr. chair, in 2009, the president issued executive order 13502, which strongly encourages federal agencies to require project labor agreements, or plas, on federal construction projects exceeding $25 million in cost. this amendment simply states, as already read, that none of the funds made available by this act may be used to implement or enforce this executive order. now, project labor agreements, mr. chair, discourage what is called a merit shop contractor from bidding on taxpayer-funded construction contracts. let me be clear. that means, if you don't have a union, you can't even bid. by the way, the vast majority of all work conducted in the united states, private or government, is conducted by nonunion contractors. it is not meant to disparage unions. it is just saying that there should be open competition for everybody. because it is a limited competition, it actually drives up the cost that each of us pay for the construction, somewhere between 12 and 18 percent, needlessly. even if it is only 12 percent, why pay it? it results in fewer infrastructure improvements simply because there is just not as much money because we are paying more for the ones that we are doing. it is a project-specific collective bargaining agreement with multiple unions that is unique only to the construction industry. it is done nowhere else, only in the construction industry. now, the nlra permits construction employees to execute a pla, a project labor agreement, voluntarily. when the pla is mandated by a government agency, construction contracts can be awarded only to contracts and subcontractors that agree to the terms and conditions of the pla, essentially making them a union organization. typically, the contractors have to recognize the union as the representative of their employees. no longer is the private business the representative, but only the union is the representative, and they have to hire from the union hall. furthermore, if you ever pay prevailing wage or the federal minimum wage for these kinds of projects, there is a thing called the fringe benefits, which includes your medical, your dental, your retirement. those all will be put into union-managed benefits and pension programs. so even if you are a private employer that is not unionized, all that money, all those fringe benefits go to those programs. you must obey the restrictive and sometimes inefficient rules of job classification. so, for instance, if you are an electrician, you might want to wire something up, but if you need some conduit, you can't go get it because you are not a laborer. you are an electrician, and you have to wait for the laborer to go get it. that doesn't happen in nonunion environments. it is just inefficient. furthermore, plas force employees to pay union dues, whether they are in the union or not, and then accept unwanted union representation. they also forfeit the benefits earned during the life of the project unless they join the union and become vested in union benefit plans. so they lose all that. quite honestly, it is just simply a union recruiting plan at taxpayer expense. i don't have problems with the union; i just don't think that we should be paying for them. the pla requirements and preferences on taxpayer-funded contracts expose procurement officials to intense political pressure because they are not negotiating normally. it is negotiated under the terms of the project labor agreement, not just a regular contract where you agree to do so much work and we would agree to pay so much. you agree to do it at this time, and we agree to accept that timeframe. it disrupts local collective bargaining agreements already in place because it is contract specific for the project at the time. obviously, because of that, it stifles competition. {time} 1000 you stifle competition, it raises the cost. who is paying the extra cost? the american taxpayer. it creates, or potentially creates, contracting and construction delays. we don't need any more delays at the va. i think we have been through that plenty of times. now, we just want to get the best price. we want everybody involved. we want everybody able to bid and able to participate. let the government, let the taxpayer get the best job for the best price. under this amendment, plas for military construction would not be forbidden. they are still not forbidden; they are just not mandated. again, this amendment simply allows none of the funds made by the executive order to be used to implement or enforce executive order 13502. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. kilmer. mr. chairman, i rise to claim the time in opposition. the chair. the gentleman from washington is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. kilmer. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. the dod does a lot of construction projects--this bill is certainly a testament to that--and these are often complex projects. they build facilities that are used to repair ships or store munitions, and usually when we read about large, complex construction projects, it is often in the context of delays or cost overruns or concerns on the workforce front. folks want to see local opportunities on local projects. now, a project labor agreement allows federal agencies to negotiate exclusively with the building trades to ensure both union and open shop contractors are able to participate on the project. the agreement establishes quality worksite conditions and works to ensure construction is finished on time and under budget. when executed properly, plas are flexible, and they encourage participation from a wide variety of prime and subcontractors. in fact, plas are used on big, private projects. look at every significant hotel project, casino project, stadium project. i worked professionally in economic development before i came here. these project labor agreements were vital to seeing projects happen. why? because they save money and because they keep projects on schedule and because they use local workers. you have seen the first project labor agreement in navy history in my district--just one, mind you. what is the [[page h2855]] outcome? well, the project is going to be completed at a cost of $250 million below what was originally projected. with a contract that was worked out ahead of time, it meant that local workers were assigned on the front end. they brought in quality workers, local workers, and that strengthens our local communities. by partnering with local trades and using apprenticeship programs, this is helping to grow the next generation of tradespeople, giving opportunities to veterans and to women and minority communities. so it means that we are not just building a wharf in my district; it means we are building the next generation of workers. we are building the middle class. when you compare this with similar large, complex projects, the project that we just had with a project labor agreement had fewer problems and will deliver more value for taxpayers. so i do not understand why we would take this valuable tool out of our toolbox. we should be encouraging these efforts. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. dent. mr. chairman, i move to strike the last word. the chair. the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. dent. mr. chairman, i just want to state i have no objection to the gentleman's amendment. the department of defense has awarded one construction contract, that is the explosives-handling wharf in kitsap, washington--i believe, in the gentleman's district--where the solicitation favored plas. the department of veterans affairs has not awarded any contracts that have used plas, and they currently have no solicitations that favor plas. that said, i am very sympathetic with the gentleman's amendment, and i urge adoption of the amendment. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. bishop of georgia. i move to strike the last word. the chair. the gentleman from georgia is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chair, i am very disappointed that, instead of seeking to pass the most bipartisan bill possible, my colleagues would prefer to weigh down the bill that funds veterans and military construction with a divisive rider. plas can be an essential tool to allow large projects to be completed on time and on budget. they are a benefit to both employers and employees. a project labor agreement provides a single collective bargaining unit, which allows for easier management of a project. they provide a reliable and uninterrupted supply of workers. they provide uniform wages, uniform benefits, overtime pay. a pla sets the terms and conditions of employment for all workers onsite, including the work conditions and the rules. in addition, a pla prohibits strikes and work stoppages. it is insulting that some would seek to prevent the use of plas on this bill when it is one of the best tools available to guarantee that veterans are hired as skilled construction workers. the use of a pla does not prevent nonunion small businesses from participating. they have to agree to the terms and to sign on to the pla. in addition, the pla does not make the project union only. simply put, project labor agreements help both the government and the private sector increase the efficiency and the quality of its project by promoting a business model that employs a highly skilled workforce. such a workforce ensures that construction projects are built correctly the first time, on time and, as a result, on budget. i urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. i would note that this house has repeatedly refused to adopt similar amendments on this bill. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. perry. mr. chairman, may i inquire how much time i have remaining. the chair. the gentleman from pennsylvania has 30 seconds remaining. mr. perry. mr. chairman, i just want to reiterate that this does not take this tool out of the toolbox. it just doesn't require it. with all due respect to those who say, well, it stops strikes from happening and it makes sure it is on time and on budget, a simple contract that millions of americans sign every single day without a project labor agreement does that already. if project labor agreements are necessary, why aren't we all doing it with the work on our homes or the work on our businesses? the fact is it is not done everywhere because it is not necessary. the fact is it discourages participation, because you can participate if you want to join the union, or at least de facto join the union because you are going to do everything by the union code, every single thing, all your employees, all your representation. i urge adoption of the amendment. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. kilmer. mr. chairman, may i inquire how much time i have remaining. the chair. the gentleman from washington has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. kilmer. mr. chairman, i yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. norcross). mr. norcross. mr. chair, let's start out by talking about some of the facts, because i hear some talking points from those who are trying to disturb and remove all workers' rights. there is nothing that currently is in place that mandates project labor agreements be used. if so, we would have thousands and thousands of them. it makes them permissible when a large and complex job would benefit from a precontract agreement, because that is what we are talking about. we are not talking about building a house or renovating a bedroom. large, complex projects, that is what we are talking about. all it talks about is, before you sign a contract, make sure that you spell out very specifically the issues that could come up germane to that job. i have negotiated in my past life over 100 of these. why? because employers understand that this is to their benefit. there is a better cost ratio balance when they do a project labor agreement. they are public jobs, they are private jobs where nobody is mandating everything or anything. what we are saying here is that entering into a project labor agreement does one very important thing that nobody quite remembers here: helmets to hardhats, taking our veterans who served our country, giving them an opportunity to come home, put their uniform away, and go to work on a construction project. that alone is worth its weight in gold, and that is what helmets to hardhats does under a project labor agreement. it creates and allows that next generation of construction workers, those skilled craftsmen, to be part of that. not one dime of that apprenticeship program comes from the government. this works. why does it work? because it saves money. the employer likes it because there are less headaches on the job, and it is probably the most important tool that could be in that worker's toolbox, to make sure that they level the playing field for a quality job that comes in on time and under budget. mr. kilmer. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. perry). the question was taken; and the chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. kilmer. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania will be postponed. amendment offered by ms. jackson lee ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will report the amendment. the clerk read as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: sec. __. none of the funds made available by this act may be used by the secretary of veterans affairs in contravention of subchapter iii of chapter 20 of title 38, united states code. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 736, the gentlewoman from texas and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from texas. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i rise to offer the jackson lee amendment that clearly recognizes the importance of those who have served and [[page h2856]] their lives after. my amendment says none of the funds made available by this act for the department of veterans affairs may be used in contravention of subchapter iii of chapter 20 of title 38 of the u.s. code, which refers to the benefits for homeless veterans in training and outreach programs. texas and florida and california happen to be some of the states that have the highest number of homeless veterans. these are individuals who put on the uniform unselfishly. now they are homeless for a variety of reasons. i hope that this amendment will reinforce and reemphasize the importance of ensuring that the rate of homelessness among veterans in the united states does not increase. as well, my amendment will remind us of our obligation to provide our veterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which includes adequate funding for programs like the veterans administration supportive housing that provides case management services, adequate housing facilities, mental health support, and addresses other issues that contribute to veterans' homelessness. i have, on my staff, a wounded warrior. we work a lot with homeless veterans. we visit their centers. we provide them with a sense that their commitment to this nation will never be forgotten. today in our country there are approximately 107,000 veterans, male and female, who are homeless on any given night, and perhaps twice as many, 200,000, experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year. i remember dealing with one of my nonprofits that was renting a space just to help three or four or five veterans. unfortunately, the landlord was not sensitive to the fact that he did not have all the moneys to pay his rent. he was ultimately evicted. but it wasn't just he who was evicted, who was trying to be the good samaritan, it was veterans who called that place home. many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because of their poverty and lack of support from their family. in my hometown of houston, for example, we have had large numbers of homeless veterans, but we have begun to work on it. i hope that this amendment will remind people of supportive service programs, residential rehabilitation programs, and hud va programs. i ask support of my amendment. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. dent. mr. chairman, i claim the time in opposition, but i do not oppose the amendment. the chair. without objection, the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. there was no objection. mr. dent. mr. chairman, the gentlewoman has offered the amendment in previous years, and we have accepted it. i have no objection to it being included again in the bill this year. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, how much time do i have remaining? the chair. the gentlewoman from texas has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from georgia (mr. bishop), the distinguished ranking member and a strong supporter of veterans and leadership on the milcon bill. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chairman, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding. i just want to let my voice be heard to congratulate the gentlewoman on her amendment. it has been adopted previously by this house. i think it is a great amendment. we support our homeless veterans. i congratulate the gentlewoman for offering the amendment. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, reclaiming my time, let me thank mr. dent and mr. bishop for their leadership, and certainly the appropriators, the full committee chairman and ranking member, on the tasks that they have before them. we are not going to end homelessness for veterans if we do not invest in programs that will help them. my amendment is to ensure that we are reminded that these veterans can be rehabilitated and can be provided a new pathway in life. it is simply a continuing way to say thank you. whenever i speak before veterans, whenever i speak before the united states military, i remind them--though they do not need to be reminded--that they unselfishly put on the uniform without question. they put on the uniform without question, and they followed orders. they followed the orders of the commander in chief. so now i hope that we, as members of congress, will follow orders and increase investment in the hud-vash program allocated to communities with the highest numbers of homeless veterans, support all council agencies to promote and give incentives to local coordination or plans and have our local communities own these plans so that they will bring down the cost of homelessness or the size of homelessness to prevent or to provide, if you will, for the homeownership that is so very important that our veterans desire. {time} 1015 but the most important point is, why don't we stand and salute and stand at attention and say to our veterans: we hear you. homelessness must not exist among our veterans. i ask my colleagues to support this amendment. it reminds us of funding for veterans who are homeless, as well as for programs for veterans who are homeless. mr. chair, i have an amendment at the desk. it is jackson lee amendment no. 350. thank you for this opportunity to describe my amendment, which simply provides that: ``none of the funds made available by this act for the department of veteran affairs--benefits for homeless veterans and training and outreach programs may be used in contravention of the title 38, part ii, chapter 20, subchapter ii and iii of the u.s. code this amendment will help ensure that the rate of homelessness among veterans in the united states does not increase. i thank subcommittee chairman dent and ranking member bishop for their hard work in shepherding this important legislation to the floor. i offer the jackson lee amendment because i believe reducing and eliminating homelessness among veterans, those who risked their lives to protect our freedom, should also be one of the nation's highest priorities. homelessness among the american veteran population is on the rise in the united states and we must be proactive in giving back to those who have given so much to us. my amendment will help remind us of our obligation to provide our veterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which includes adequately funding for programs veterans administration supportive housing (vash) that provide case-management services, adequate housing facilities, mental health support, and address other areas that contribute to veteran homelessness. vash is a jointly-administered permanent supportive housing program for disabled veterans experiencing homelessness in which va medical centers provide referrals and case management while public housing agencies (phas) administer the section 8 housing vouchers. mr. chair, our veterans deserve the best services available, and i believe that we could be doing much more for them. today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male and female) who are homeless on any given night. and perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year. many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because of their poverty, lack of support from family and friends, and dismal living conditions in cheap hotels or in overcrowded or substandard housing. while significant progress has been made, ending homelessness among veterans remains a big challenge. in my hometown of houston for example, between the years 2010 and 2012, the number of homeless veterans increased from 771 to 1,162. we must remain vigilant and continue to fight for those who put on the uniform and fought for us. providing a home for veterans to come home to every night is the very least we can do. mr. chair, programs like vash have succeeded in changing lives. in 2012 alone, 35,905 veterans lived in the public housing provided by vash. i have seen the impact of such grants in my home state of texas, and within my congressional district in houston, and i am sure that this funding has positively impacted many communities across this country. in texas, there are committed groups in houston, working to eradicate the issue of homelessness. [[page h2857]] for example, the michael e. debakey va medical center has been involved in changing veterans' lives in a mighty way by providing veterans and their families with access to affordable housing and medical services that will help them get back on their feet. mr. chair, we cannot let this issue of homelessness continue. i urge my colleagues to support the jackson lee amendment and commit ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran homelessness in america. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). the amendment was agreed to. amendment offered by mr. gibson mr. gibson. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will report the amendment. the clerk read as follows: at the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the following: sec. __. none of the funds made available in this act may be used to enforce va adjudication procedure manual m21-1, part iv, subpart ii, chapter 1, section h, topic 28.h related to developing claims based on service aboard ships offshore the rvn. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 736, the gentleman from new york and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from new york. mr. gibson. mr. chairman, i want to thank the parliamentarian and the chairman and the ranking member. earlier this morning, i offered this amendment and it needed to be perfected. i greatly appreciate the staff and the work of the team here so that we could get this in a form to where it certainly meets muster. this is a very important amendment. half a century ago, our nation was embroiled in a war in vietnam. it divided the nation. but for our young men and women who went forward and fought on our behalf, their loyalties were never divided. they did everything that they could every day to serve our nation in a very difficult circumstance. what developed over that time were soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who became sick. they were exposed to agent orange. this was part of that war. our nation had chosen to defoliate as a means of protecting troops with agent orange. but what we learned over time is that there was a direct link between exposure to agent orange and nine maladies, including cancer, diabetes and parkinson's. this body, in 1991, recognizing this, came together with the president of the united states and enacted the agent orange act of 1991. unfortunately, in 2002, there was an overreach on the part of the executive that narrowed that interpretation. and since that time, members here on both sides of the aisle have been fighting to ensure that our sailors who served just offshore in vietnam got access to the health care that they desperately need. mr. chairman, over half of these sailors who were exposed are already in heaven. they are gone now. and for those that are left here, time is of the essence. it is an urgent matter that we get this passed. three hundred twenty of my colleagues agree with this on both sides of the aisle, and about half the senate. so today, we offer this amendment to reassert our article i prerogatives to ensure that, for every serviceman and woman that goes forward, that they know that, regardless of the difficulty of the fight and the difficulty of the proposition and what it may mean for the politics here in america, we will never turn our back on our servicemen and -women. mr. chair, i ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and i reserve the balance of my time. announcement by the chair the chair. the chair will remind members to turn off cell phones when they enter the house chamber. mr. dent. mr. chairman, i claim time in opposition, but i am not opposed. the chair. without objection, the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. there was no objection. mr. dent. mr. chairman, we support the amendment. we appreciate the good work that my friend from new york (mr. gibson) has done to advocate on behalf of all veterans, and particularly his commitment to helping those who suffered from agent orange exposure, as well as many other issues. so i support the amendment, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. gibson. mr. chair, i deeply appreciate the support of the chairman and ranking member, and i respectfully request the support of the house on this amendment. mr. chair, i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york (mr. gibson). the amendment was agreed to. amendment offered by mr. sean patrick maloney of new york mr. sean patrick maloney of new york. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will report the amendment. the clerk read as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: sec.__. none of the funds made available by this act may be used in contravention of executive order no. 13672 of july 21, 2014 (``further amendments to executive order 11478, equal employment opportunity in the federal government, and executive order 11246, equal employment opportunity''). the chair. pursuant to house resolution 736, the gentleman from new york and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from new york. mr. sean patrick maloney of new york. mr. speaker, last night, this house adopted a provision as part of the defense bill that rolls back antidiscrimination provisions contained in executive orders issued by the president in recent years. this is one of the ugliest episodes i have experienced in my 3-plus years as a member of this house. the inclusion of such hate-based language in a defense bill designed to support our military sends exactly the wrong message at a time when we should all be unified in supporting the efforts of our servicemembers around the world. my father was a veteran. he was nearly killed in the service of his country. i have never voted against a defense bill before. i never thought i would. almost a quarter of the constituents i represent in the hudson valley of new york come from families where a member is serving in the military or has served in the military. i represent the united states military academy at west point. we have helped 800 veterans, one at a time, out of my district office in my 3 years in congress, and we have passed legislation directly aimed at making their lives better. so, it is not with an easy heart that i come to the house floor and oppose the defense bill, but this legislation snuck into the bill--and was kept in the bill--despite a bipartisan effort to remove it, sends exactly the wrong signal and it says that we are so concerned about discriminating against a group of lgbt americans that we are willing to destroy the bipartisan cooperation we should have on the defense bill. so my amendment today gives us another chance. it gives us a chance to correct some of the damage done last night by some members of this body. what it would say is quite simple: we shall not do anything in this bill that contravenes the antidiscrimination executive orders of the president. it is pretty simple. we should not be spending taxpayer dollars to promote hate, and we should not be justifying that by some religious exemption, when, in fact, the language in the defense bill simply rolls back the antidiscrimination provisions that the president put in an executive order to those contained in the original civil rights act and the ada. it is specifically designed to exclude lgbt americans. and in doing that, it aligns itself with the parallel efforts we see happening in states like north carolina. it is wrong and it doesn't have anything to do with our military; it doesn't have anything to do with fighting isis; it doesn't have anything to do with religious protections. it is about bigotry, plain and simple. today, we have another chance to do the right thing and to send the right message and to stick up for our military. [[page h2858]] mr. dent. will the gentleman yield? mr. sean patrick maloney of new york. i yield to the gentleman from pennsylvania. mr. dent. i support the amendment, and i certainly oppose discrimination in any way, shape, or form, particularly as, in this case, it relates to federal contracting. i do support the amendment. mr. sean patrick maloney of new york. reclaiming my time, i want to thank the gentleman from pennsylvania, and i want to acknowledge that it was the gentleman from pennsylvania, together with mr. hanna from new york, who courageously led the effort to roll back the discrimination in a bipartisan way in the rules committee. and that effort was thwarted. so i am very honored by the gentleman's support, and i am honored by the position you have taken in this house over the last couple of days. mr. chair, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. sessions. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition. the chair. the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. sessions. mr. chairman, i do respect the gentleman for his right to come and offer under an open rule, in a different bill, his objections to what occurred last night. last night, the house of representatives passed the bill. and today, the gentleman is offering a limiting amendment that would turn back that agreement that we made. mr. chairman, several days ago, the house armed services committee handled this issue. it was not sneaking something in. it was a straight-up vote. it was a vote that was held in the armed services committee, it passed. the final vote was 60-2. mr. chairman, that is a bipartisan vote. that is a vote from people on the committee who viewed that they were not going to let one issue or another get in the way of supporting the men and women of our united states military. they very clearly--all of them on the committee-- understood during this long markup exactly the implications, and they lived with the decision. i am here today to say that the gentleman is fully entitled to do as he is doing, but the vote was held last night. the overwhelming viewpoint was let's support the united states military and let's get this done, not the next day come on the floor with spilled milk on your face and say: i want to go back and i want to relitigate a decision that we made last night with every member here on the floor. mr. sean patrick maloney of new york. will the gentleman yield? mr. sessions. i yield to the gentleman. i admire the gentleman. mr. sean patrick maloney of new york. well, i appreciate the admiration. let me ask my colleague: is it necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians to support our military? mr. sessions. reclaiming my time, that issue was handled--and the gentleman knows this--in committee. i yield to the gentleman. mr. sean patrick maloney of new york. it was resolved last night. it was resolved last night in the affirmative. in other words, this house said that it would include in a defense bill a provision that would roll back basic employment questions for gays and lesbians. my question to my colleague is simply, mr. chairman, if that is necessary for the promotion of national defense. is it necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians and transgender americans to keep our country safe? mr. sessions. reclaiming my time, mr. chairman. i appreciate the gentleman. i am not without an understanding that there are people who do have ideas which override other bigger ideas. i am simply saying to you, mr. chairman, i stand in opposition to what the gentleman is attempting to do here, the next day, in a separate bill, to limit what we did last night, when this body did understand that many people have a strong viewpoint that supports the gentleman, and more people have a viewpoint that is against that. that is not my point. my point is, we need to transcend that as a body. and we did last night. we spoke very clearly. we need to support the men and women of the united states military. and we do not believe this is a stumbling block because we don't view what the gentleman is saying is the critical and key issue. that is why i stand in opposition to what the gentleman is doing. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. sean patrick maloney of new york. mr. chairman, i ask unanimous consent to reclaim my time. the chair. is there an objection to the request of the gentleman from new york? mr. sessions. objection. the chair. objection is heard. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chairman, i move to strike the last word. the chair. the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chair, i yield to the gentleman from new york (mr. sean patrick maloney). mr. sean patrick maloney of new york. mr. chair, i would like to again express my thanks for my colleague's admiration. it is nice to have admiration. it is better to have rights and it is better to be treated equally and without condescension. i would just note, mr. chairman, that the question remains unanswered of whether it is necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians in federal contracting to protect our country, to support our troops? is it necessary to remove employment protections in employers covering 28 million americans so that we can fight the war on isis? is it necessary to protect ourselves in our houses of worship by discriminating in federal contracting in businesses that are in the business of commerce and in private contracting? it is a tired and old and false choice to suggest that we need to discriminate to keep ourselves safe, to keep ourselves free. and people in earlier times have made those arguments, and they have, one after another, been reversed. so the notion that because this house did it last night, it can't get it right today, is at odds with a lot of american history. this house got a lot of things wrong for a lot of people for a lot of years. and then finally, slowly, almost despite ourselves, we figured out that we can be safe and free and equal. and in fact, becoming more equal in some ways makes us safer because it is the promotion of our values through our actions and our ideas and our words, not just our weapons that promote our values around the world. {time} 1030 mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chairman, i yield to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i thank the gentleman for his kindness. i want to briefly join in the gentleman's recounting of our history, and i want to remind people of the eloquent statement of the attorney general, attorney general lynch, who indicated that civil rights is a very large tent, and it embraces all americans. whether it is religious freedom or religious rights, or whether it is civil rights issues dealing with the race and ethnicity of americans, we have always overcome. i believe that the men and women of the united states military deserve better than to have the kind of poisonous amendments that undermine the very reason that they put on the uniform, for us to be free, to speak freely, to associate, and to stand as who we are. i am saddened because my history is a reminder that i did not stand equal in this nation, either as a woman or an african american, or even as an immigrant, which my grandparents were. so i join in pleading with this house to not, in any way, strip us of civil rights and tear up the constitution, the 14th amendment, the fifth amendment of due process. that would be shame on us. i join the gentleman in his amendment, and i ask that we consider those who we like and who we dislike. they are americans, and they deserve the right to be respected under the law. i would ask that the gentleman's amendment be accepted, voted on, respected; and let us be the americans that our constitution dictates and our flag says we are. mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york (mr. sean patrick maloney). [[page h2859]] the question was taken; and the chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. mr. sean patrick maloney of new york. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to

report the last three lines of the bill. the clerk read as follows: this act may be cited as the ``military construction and veterans affairs and related agencies appropriations act, 2017''. mr. dent. mr. chairman, i move that the committee do now rise and report the bill back to the house with sundry amendments, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass. the motion was agreed to. accordingly, the committee rose; and the speaker pro tempore (mr. thompson of pennsylvania) having assumed the chair, mr. collins of georgia, chair of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union, reported that that committee, having had under consideration the bill (h.r. 4974) making appropriations for military construction, the department of veterans affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30, 2017, and for other purposes, directed him to report the bill back to the house with sundry amendments adopted in the committee of the whole, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass. the speaker pro tempore. under the rule, the previous question is ordered. for what purpose does the gentleman from maryland, the minority whip, seek recognition? parliamentary inquiry mr. hoyer. mr. speaker, i have a parliamentary inquiry. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. mr. hoyer. i want to raise a parliamentary inquiry, initially, with reference to the fact that mr. ryan, our speaker, has told us that, if people were in the well, the vote would be held open. i was standing in the well. no one came or no one had the courage to come into the well to change their vote. but notwithstanding that, the vote kept changing. mr. speaker, from a parliamentary perspective, how is that possible? the speaker pro tempore. the chair may not yet have made a request for changes. mr. hoyer. i saw no one come to the desk to change their vote, mr. speaker. the speaker pro tempore. does the gentleman have a parliamentary inquiry? mr. hoyer. the parliamentary inquiry is: how can the vote change when [[page h2866]] no one comes to the well to change their vote? the speaker pro tempore. the chair may not yet have made a request for changes. mr. hoyer. i didn't hear the chair request change. but i do know that, from my own personal observation, not one of those members who apparently changed their vote--because it kept changing on the board-- came to this well and had the courage to change from green to red or red to green. how is that possible, mr. speaker? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman has not stated a parliamentary inquiry. is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the committee of the whole? if not, the chair will put them en gros. the question is on the amendments. the amendments were agreed to. parliamentary inquiry mr. hoyer. mr. speaker, i have a parliamentary inquiry. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. mr. hoyer. mr. speaker, i did not hear and, therefore, was not able to ask for a recorded vote on the motion to rise. the speaker did not articulate that so the house could hear it, and i request a vote on the motion to rise. now, the speaker may tell me we are past that point, but the fact of the matter is, nobody on this house floor heard the speaker articulate the issue of whether the committee ought to rise. the speaker pro tempore. the house is definitely past that point. is the gentleman seeking a recorded vote? mr. hoyer. on the motion to rise, yes, sir. the speaker pro tempore. the chair has put the question on the adoption of the amendments. mr. hoyer. i ask for a recorded vote on the adoption of the amendment. which amendment is the speaker talking about? the speaker pro tempore. the chair has put the question on the amendments reported from the committee of the whole. mr. hoyer. yes, i do. the speaker pro tempore. a recorded vote is requested. mr. hoyer. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent to withdraw my request for a recorded vote. it is my understanding that because the

CREC-2016-05-19-pt1-PgH2867-2,CREC-2016-05-19,114,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2867-H2869] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the schedule for the week to come. Madam Speaker, I thought I saw the whip. I am prepared to yield to someone to tell us the schedule for the week to come. Pending someone telling me about the schedule for the week to come, let me observe, as someone who has served, Madam Speaker, in this House for a very extended period of time--some 36 years--I was here in the era not too long ago, but long ago--when, if we had done to the Republicans what was done to us, what was done to switch votes so that discrimination could prevail, there would be outrage expressed long into the night from our Republican colleagues who would accuse us of undermining democracy, undermining this House, and making the House less than it should be. 217 people stood up and said: We ought not discriminate. And then, very frankly, Mr. Speaker, the leadership on the Republican side started its activity. And I have been the majority leader, I have been the whip. I understand that process. And they reached out to people and said: No, let us be able to discriminate. Let contractors be able to discriminate. Mr. Speaker, seven people who had voted not to allow discrimination decided perhaps that principle was not as important as they thought just a minute or so before. I have a list of those names here--a lamentable list of people who did the right thing, who stood up for nondiscrimination, and then were opportuned to change their vote. And the Record reflects, Mr. Speaker, sadly, that they changed their vote. I won't characterize those votes, because that would not be in order on this floor. And they will have themselves to look at tonight in the mirror and explain to themselves whether their first vote was a principled vote, or whether they had a Damascus Road experience in the few minutes that transpired between their voting not to allow discrimination, until they later--just a few minutes later--at the opportuning of some of their leaders, voted to allow discrimination. A sad day, Mr. Speaker, in the history of the House. {time} 1215 I still see no leader, unless Mr. Dent, who I have great respect for, wants to tell us what the schedule is for next week. I would be glad to yield to him for that purpose. Mr. Speaker, I want to say that the majority leader is not here. The majority leader has a very happy day today, and I congratulate him. His son is graduating from Georgetown, and he obviously needs to be there. I was hoping someone else could tell us the schedule. At this point in time, I would be glad to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), my friend, the chairman of the Rules Committee. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to politely offer a viewpoint. I believe that we do not view that the issue was discrimination. We have the viewpoint that, earlier in the week, we [[Page H2868]] brought forth a bill that passed 40-2 in the Committee on Armed Services, and that bill was brought forth to the Rules Committee, and we held hours and hours and hours and hours of hearing that Republicans and Democrats were not only welcome to attend, but did attend. The debate that we had on the issue was very full and was brought forth not only at the Rules Committee, but also on this floor. A decision therein was made. There was an opportunity for our Members to vote, and that is exactly what they did. And I am sure the gentleman would want every single Member to vote and have time to think about that vote until the time that the vote closed, and that is exactly what happened. So a characterization that this was discrimination would not be, in my opinion, fair or correct, from our perspective. And I appreciate the gentleman allowing me a chance to amplify that every Member of this body is entitled to their vote, and every Member of this body, without questioning, in my opinion, that vote, should be afforded that opportunity. So I stand on behalf of Republicans to say that we followed processes; we are following procedures; and we are following the opportunity for a Member of Congress to vote as they choose, and try not to impugn or to test that with applying the word ``discrimination,'' which I feel is not accurate under our intent. I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments. And the gentleman will observe, I have neither mentioned the names, nor did I impugn their integrity or their motivation. What I said and what I will repeat is, initially they voted for an amendment that said there shall not be discrimination by contractors who get government money. That is what the amendment said. And they voted against discrimination, and for that amendment. But in a short period of time, they changed that vote, resulting in, not becoming law yet, but this House saying to the administration: You cannot require contractors not to discriminate. That was the effect of it. And characterizing the effect of a vote is what our debate is about, what our country's values are about, what our country's future is about, and the respect we have for every citizen in this country, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. And we ought not preclude those through discrimination. That I can characterize without impugning motives. But the effect of the vote, we had 217 people for nondiscrimination right up until the last moment. And by the way, the last moment was far beyond what Speaker Ryan has said ought to be the end of votes. Mr. SESSIONS. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. If I could just finish my sentence, I will certainly do that. I talked to the Parliamentarians. Interestingly, the presiding officer did not ask: Does any Member want to change his vote? Because once that, as I understand it, is intoned, then the ability to change one's vote, except to come forward and be seen in changing your vote, was not stated, which I suggest to the chairman of the Rules Committee, who knows the rules very well, is unusual--perhaps not against the rules--but unusual. And the vote was an extended vote. The Speaker, Speaker Ryan, has talked to us from the rostrum, saying that we want to keep votes to a limited period of time. Particularly, I would suggest, we all want to keep votes to a limited period of time when it is a so-called getaway day. But in this instance, that did not occur. In this instance, to change from 217 to a lesser number that was a losing number--215-214, I believe, was the final vote--excuse me, 212-213, 212 ``ayes.'' So five votes were switched, net. However, one person voted late. Again, seven people changed their vote. You are correct. They had a right to do that, but the consequences of that vote are subject to debate. And I raise for you, for this House, and for the American people, that the changing of those seven votes resulted in this House saying to the President of the United States: You cannot tell contractors that they cannot discriminate. That, I think, was unfortunate. I yield to my friend. Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you very much. First of all, let me state this: I am a Republican. We do not discriminate. We attempt to follow the law, and the gentleman knows that. We make laws, and those laws can be subject to interpretations of what is and what is not, but we follow the law, and the gentleman knows that. And we follow the law, and my party follows the law. Secondly, the decision had previously been made the night before. We were not trying to do that today. It was, once again, allowed under the rules because the gentleman accurately--whether it is appropriate or not, that is up to him--brought forth, under an open rule, a limiting amendment. But we had decided this the night before. And when people recognized what had happened, that this was a vote that had happened the night before, off of a committee vote out of the Committee on Armed Services that was 40-2, there were people who then recognized what they were doing. It is not unusual to have people vote and then change their vote. I have done that also. But the rules were followed despite, perhaps, different procedural ways in which a person is in the Chair. So I will tell you, I respect the gentleman, and you know me well. Mr. HOYER. I do. Mr. SESSIONS. I would not stand up here if I were for fear of one second of not being able to understand you and you understand me. I understand you. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. Mr. SESSIONS. And I thank the gentleman. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments. But let me make an observation. I wish the gentleman would stay in the well because he might want to respond. I did not accuse the Republican Party of discriminating. I will not, at this point in time, hazard an opinion on that fact. However, I want to recall to the gentleman that, in the Armed Services Committee, after due consideration, the Armed Services Committee voted not to discriminate, not to discriminate against women, not to say to women: Yes, you can serve, but you don't have to sign up for the draft. Many of us felt that if you are going to ask young men to sign up for the draft, young women ought to be treated equally. We felt not to do so was discrimination. That amendment passed in the committee and came to the Rules Committee--my understanding is--without a vote, without discussion. The rule that was issued from the Rules Committee said that, upon adoption of that rule, the adopted amendment in the Armed Services Committee, without a singular vote on this floor of the House, would be defeated. That, I say to the gentleman, was neither regular order, nor was it giving us an ability to make a decision on that issue. And I believe, I personally believe, that it results in continuing discrimination against young men and young women, one of which has to sign up, the other whom does not; but they both have to serve, or can serve voluntarily in the Armed Forces of the United States. So we may have a difference of opinion on whether or not that was, in fact, discrimination. But I will tell the gentleman that I was not happy, and I am still not happy that we did not have a vote on the floor about what we perceive to be discrimination. And I regret that the Rules Committee chose to hide in its rule the repeal of what the Armed Services Committee adopted. If the gentleman wants to respond, I will yield to him. Mr. SESSIONS. I will concur that I, in fact, did offer in the bill a self-executed portion. Not trying to take advantage of the gentleman, it had nothing to do with the draft. So I will agree that I did take a piece. And to save this body, because a number of people who did vote for it in committee--which became a voice vote--did wish to change their opinion. But it had nothing to do with the draft, sir. Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, it seems what the gentleman is saying is that people vote not to discriminate, and then some time a little later on, they have an epiphany that perhaps discrimination is okay. Perhaps that is what the gentleman said. [[Page H2869]] Mr. SESSIONS. I would ask an indulgence. It had nothing to do with discrimination. It had to do with a new policy. And it is true that I did rule and put a self-executing rule in that did answer the question about the desire of the committee to handle this issue, and I did it accordingly. I thank the gentleman. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, it appears that no one is going to be able to tell me what the schedule is for the week to come. I will tell you that that is unfortunate. I hope there is a schedule for the week to come because there is a lot to be done. We haven't finalized Zika. We passed a bill here which we think was inadequate. We haven't dealt with Flint. We need to pass Puerto Rico restructuring. I think they have made some progress on that. I congratulate the Speaker and the leader for facilitating that progress. We don't have a voting rights bill scheduled. We need to do that. There are a number of other serious pieces of legislation this House needs to consider. We are going to go out next week, and we will have no colloquy next week, Mr. Speaker. There will be no opportunity to discuss the schedule for, obviously, the break, and we will have no schedule for June or the weeks thereafter to do some of the serious business that confronts us and to help some of the people in this country who need help. Having said that, Mr. Speaker, it is clear that nobody on the other side is going to have any response. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2867-H2869] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

However, one person voted late. Again, seven people changed their vote. You are correct. They had a right to do that, but the consequences of that vote are subject to debate. And I raise for you, for this House, and for the American people, that the changing of those seven votes resulted in this House saying to the President of the United States: You cannot tell contractors that they cannot discriminate. That, I think, was unfortunate. I yield to my friend. Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you very much. First of all, let me state this: I am a Republican. We do not discriminate. We attempt to follow the law, and the gentleman knows that. We make laws, and those laws can be subject to interpretations of what is and what is not, but we follow the law, and the gentleman knows that. And we follow the law, and my party follows the law. Secondly, the decision had previously been made the night before. We were not trying to do that today. It was, once again, allowed under the rules because the gentleman accurately--whether it is appropriate or not, that is up to him--brought forth, under an open rule, a limiting amendment. But we had decided this the night before. And when people recognized what had happened, that this was a vote that had happened the night before, off of a committee vote out of the Committee on Armed Services that was 40-2, there were people who then recognized what they were doing. It is not unusual to have people vote and then change their vote. I have done that also. But the rules were followed despite, perhaps, different procedural ways in which a person is in the Chair. So I will tell you, I respect the gentleman, and you know me well. Mr. HOYER. I do. Mr. SESSIONS. I would not stand up here if I were for fear of one second of not being able to understand you and you understand me. I understand you. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. Mr. SESSIONS. And I thank the gentleman. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments. But let me make an observation. I wish the gentleman would stay in the well because he might want to respond. I did not accuse the Republican Party of discriminating. I will not, at this point in time, hazard an opinion on that fact. However, I want to recall to the gentleman that, in the Armed Services Committee, after due consideration, the Armed Services Committee voted not to discriminate, not to discriminate against women, not to say to women: Yes, you can serve, but you don't have to sign up for the draft. Many of us felt that if you are going to ask young men to sign up for the draft, young women ought to be treated equally. We felt not to do so was discrimination. That amendment passed in the committee and came to the Rules Committee--my understanding is--without a vote, without discussion. The rule that was issued from the Rules Committee said that, upon adoption of that rule, the adopted amendment in the Armed Services Committee, without a singular vote on this floor of the House, would be defeated. That, I say to the gentleman, was neither regular order, nor was it giving us an ability to make a decision on that issue. And I believe, I personally believe, that it results in continuing discrimination against young men and young women, one of which has to sign up, the other whom does not; but they both have to serve, or can serve voluntarily in the Armed Forces of the United States. So we may have a difference of opinion on whether or not that was, in fact, discrimination. But I will tell the gentleman that I was not happy, and I am still not happy that we did not have a vote on the floor about what we perceive to be discrimination. And I regret that the Rules Committee chose to hide in its rule the repeal of what the Armed Services Committee adopted. If the gentleman wants to respond, I will yield to him. Mr. SESSIONS. I will concur that I, in fact, did offer in the bill a self-executed portion. Not trying to take advantage of the gentleman, it had nothing to do with the draft. So I will agree that I did take a piece. And to save this body, because a number of people who did vote for it in committee--which became a voice vote--did wish to change their opinion. But it had nothing to do with the draft, sir. Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, it seems what the gentleman is saying is that people vote not to discriminate, and then some time a little later on, they have an epiphany that perhaps discrimination is okay. Perhaps that is what the gentleman said. [[Page H2869]] Mr. SESSIONS. I would ask an indulgence. It had nothing to do with discrimination. It had to do with a new policy. And it is true that I did rule and put a self-executing rule in that did answer the question about the desire of the committee to handle this issue, and I did it accordingly. I thank the gentleman. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, it appears that no one is going to be able to tell me what the schedule is for the week to come. I will tell you that that is unfortunate. I hope there is a schedule for the week to come because there is a lot to be done. We haven't finalized Zika. We passed a bill here which we think was inadequate. We haven't dealt with Flint. We need to pass Puerto Rico restructuring. I think they have made some progress on that. I congratulate the Speaker and the leader for facilitating that progress. We don't have a voting rights bill scheduled. We need to do that. There are a number of other serious pieces of legislation this House needs to consider. We are going to go out next week, and we will have no colloquy next week, Mr. Speaker. There will be no opportunity to discuss the schedule for, obviously, the break, and we will have no schedule for June or the weeks thereafter to do some of the serious business that confronts us and to help some of the people in this country who need help. Having said that, Mr. Speaker, it is clear that nobody on the other side is going to have any response. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2867-H2869] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the schedule for the week to come. Madam Speaker, I thought I saw the whip. I am prepared to yield to someone to tell us the schedule for the week to come. Pending someone telling me about the schedule for the week to come, let me observe, as someone who has served, Madam Speaker, in this House for a very extended period of time--some 36 years--I was here in the era not too long ago, but long ago--when, if we had done to the Republicans what was done to us, what was done to switch votes so that discrimination could prevail, there would be outrage expressed long into the night from our Republican colleagues who would accuse us of undermining democracy, undermining this House, and making the House less than it should be. 217 people stood up and said: We ought not discriminate. And then, very frankly, Mr. Speaker, the leadership on the Republican side started its activity. And I have been the majority leader, I have been the whip. I understand that process. And they reached out to people and said: No, let us be able to discriminate. Let contractors be able to discriminate. Mr. Speaker, seven people who had voted not to allow discrimination decided perhaps that principle was not as important as they thought just a minute or so before. I have a list of those names here--a lamentable list of people who did the right thing, who stood up for nondiscrimination, and then were opportuned to change their vote. And the Record reflects, Mr. Speaker, sadly, that they changed their vote. I won't characterize those votes, because that would not be in order on this floor. And they will have themselves to look at tonight in the mirror and explain to themselves whether their first vote was a principled vote, or whether they had a Damascus Road experience in the few minutes that transpired between their voting not to allow discrimination, until they later--just a few minutes later--at the opportuning of some of their leaders, voted to allow discrimination. A sad day, Mr. Speaker, in the history of the House. {time} 1215 I still see no leader, unless Mr. Dent, who I have great respect for, wants to tell us what the schedule is for next week. I would be glad to yield to him for that purpose. Mr. Speaker, I want to say that the majority leader is not here. The majority leader has a very happy day today, and I congratulate him. His son is graduating from Georgetown, and he obviously needs to be there. I was hoping someone else could tell us the schedule. At this point in time, I would be glad to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), my friend, the chairman of the Rules Committee. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to politely offer a viewpoint. I believe that we do not view that the issue was discrimination. We have the viewpoint that, earlier in the week, we [[Page H2868]] brought forth a bill that passed 40-2 in the Committee on Armed Services, and that bill was brought forth to the Rules Committee, and we held hours and hours and hours and hours of hearing that Republicans and Democrats were not only welcome to attend, but did attend. The debate that we had on the issue was very full and was brought forth not only at the Rules Committee, but also on this floor. A decision therein was made. There was an opportunity for our Members to vote, and that is exactly what they did. And I am sure the gentleman would want every single Member to vote and have time to think about that vote until the time that the vote closed, and that is exactly what happened. So a characterization that this was discrimination would not be, in my opinion, fair or correct, from our perspective. And I appreciate the gentleman allowing me a chance to amplify that every Member of this body is entitled to their vote, and every Member of this body, without questioning, in my opinion, that vote, should be afforded that opportunity. So I stand on behalf of Republicans to say that we followed processes; we are following procedures; and we are following the opportunity for a Member of Congress to vote as they choose, and try not to impugn or to test that with applying the word ``discrimination,'' which I feel is not accurate under our intent. I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments. And the gentleman will observe, I have neither mentioned the names, nor did I impugn their integrity or their motivation. What I said and what I will repeat is, initially they voted for an amendment that said there shall not be discrimination by contractors who get government money. That is what the amendment said. And they voted against discrimination, and for that amendment. But in a short period of time, they changed that vote, resulting in, not becoming law yet, but this House saying to the administration: You cannot require contractors not to discriminate. That was the effect of it. And characterizing the effect of a vote is what our debate is about, what our country's values are about, what our country's future is about, and the respect we have for every citizen in this country, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. And we ought not preclude those through discrimination. That I can characterize without impugning motives. But the effect of the vote, we had 217 people for nondiscrimination right up until the last moment. And by the way, the last moment was far beyond what Speaker Ryan has said ought to be the end of votes. Mr. SESSIONS. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. If I could just finish my sentence, I will certainly do that. I talked to the Parliamentarians. Interestingly, the presiding officer did not ask: Does any Member want to change his vote? Because once that, as I understand it, is intoned, then the ability to change one's vote, except to come forward and be seen in changing your vote, was not stated, which I suggest to the chairman of the Rules Committee, who knows the rules very well, is unusual--perhaps not against the rules--but unusual. And the vote was an extended vote. The Speaker, Speaker Ryan, has talked to us from the rostrum, saying that we want to keep votes to a limited period of time. Particularly, I would suggest, we all want to keep votes to a limited period of time when it is a so-called getaway day. But in this instance, that did not occur. In this instance, to change from 217 to a lesser number that was a losing number--215-214, I believe, was the final vote--excuse me, 212-213, 212 ``ayes.'' So five votes were switched, net.

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Greg Parker, founder and president of Parker's Market and gas stations in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Mr. Parker found his way to an immensely successful business through hard work and dedication. Mr. Parker's father ran a gas station in Midway, Georgia, allowing Mr. Parker to learn the business through pumping gas and cleaning customers' windshields. After graduation from the University of Georgia, Mr. Parker began to work relentlessly in his father's gas station. He managed a convenience store, cooked food for customers, and also pumped gas and cleaned windshields. Now Parker's has 45 stores up and down the coast of Georgia and South Carolina, with a total of 600 employees. Furthermore, Parker's Market plans to build 17 new stores in the next 13 months. The Savannah Morning News even named him the 2013 Entrepreneur of the Year. Mr. Parker's service to the First Congressional District of Georgia does not end with his successful business, as he also generously donates each year to local schools and hospitals. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [House] [Page H2869] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING GREG PARKER (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

CREC-2016-05-19-pt1-PgH2870-2,CREC-2016-05-19,114,ISSUES OF THE DAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2870-H2871] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ISSUES OF THE DAY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor, and I also rise to challenge. My honoring is to acknowledge the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and to honor those who have fallen in battle, and to acknowledge the fact that an officer is killed somewhere in the United States every 60 hours, and there are also 58,930 assaults and 15,404 injuries. So I salute those who have fallen and offer my sympathy to their families, but I recognize that it is important to honor them, and we do honor them. That is why I rise today with sadness on what we did on the floor of the House, where we actually said to the LGBT community that serve in the United States military or by contracting work serve the United States Government, that you are not equal. How sad that is. I am looking forward to this House, next week, overturning that dastardly provision that says that one American who comes under the Constitution is not equal. Finally, let me say that we are suffering from the possibility of the Zika virus, and this House must fully fund for the Zika virus epidemic that is coming. Mr. Speaker, this week the nation observes National Police Week, as we have since President John F. Kennedy first proclaimed National Peace Officers Memorial Day on May 15, 1962. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial is the nation's monument to law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty. Dedicated on October 15, 1991, the Memorial honors federal, state and local law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and protection of our nation and its people. Carved on its walls are the names of 20,789 officers who have been killed in the line of duty throughout U.S. history, dating back to the first known death in 1791. Added to the Wall this year will be the names of the 123 police officers killed in the line of duty in 2015. Mr. Speaker, enshrined on the Memorial Wall of Honor also are the names of 1,695 fallen peace officers from the state of Texas, the most of any state, including 114 members of the Houston Police Department who gave their lives to keep their city safe. I include a list of these fallen heroes from Houston, Texas. Mr. Speaker, today there are more than 900,000 law enforcement personnel serving the people of our country, the highest amount ever. About 12 percent of them are female. These brave men and women risk their lives to keep the peace and keep us safe but they are too often taken by the violence they are working to prevent. Every year, a law enforcement officer is killed somewhere in the United States every 60 hours, and there are also 58,930 assaults against our law officers each year, resulting in 15,404 injuries. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Law Enforcement Caucus I am proud to represent the people of the 18th Congressional District of Texas in paying tribute to the 123 fallen heroes who will be joining the 20,789 gallant men and women who gave the last full measure of devotion to the communities they took an oath to protect and serve. In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me pay tribute to one of the finest public servants America has produced, Lee Patrick Brown, who is perhaps best known to the law enforcement community as the ``The Father of Community Policing.'' Lee Brown was appointed in 1982 as the first African-American Chief of Police of the Houston Police Department, where he pioneered techniques in community policing to reduce crime that still used throughout the country today. Lee Brown enjoyed a long and distinguished career leading several of the nation's most important and largest police departments, including those of Atlanta, Georgia, and New York City, before becoming the first African American Mayor of Houston, Texas in 1997. Following Lee Brown as Chief of the Houston Police Department were the following good and true public servants: Elizabeth Watson (1990- 1992); Sam Nuchia (1992-1997); Clarence Bradford (1997-2004); Harold Hunt (2004-2009); and Charles McClelland (2010-2016). Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in memory of the officers whose names will be added to the National Peace Officers Memorial Wall of Honor.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor, and I also rise to challenge. My honoring is to acknowledge the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and to honor those who have fallen in battle, and to acknowledge the fact that an officer is killed somewhere in the United States every 60 hours, and there are also 58,930 assaults and 15,404 injuries. So I salute those who have fallen and offer my sympathy to their families, but I recognize that it is important to honor them, and we do honor them. That is why I rise today with sadness on what we did on the floor of the House, where we actually said to the LGBT community that serve in the United States military or by contracting work serve the United States Government, that you are not equal. How sad that is. I am looking forward to this House, next week, overturning that dastardly provision that says that one American who comes under the Constitution is not equal. Finally, let me say that we are suffering from the possibility of the Zika virus, and this House must fully fund for the Zika virus epidemic that is coming. Mr. Speaker, this week the nation observes National Police Week, as we have since President John F. Kennedy first proclaimed National Peace Officers Memorial Day on May 15, 1962. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial is the nation's monument to law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty. Dedicated on October 15, 1991, the Memorial honors federal, state and local law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and protection of our nation and its people. Carved on its walls are the names of 20,789 officers who have been killed in the line of duty throughout U.S. history, dating back to the first known death in 1791. Added to the Wall this year will be the names of the 123 police officers killed in the line of duty in 2015. Mr. Speaker, enshrined on the Memorial Wall of Honor also are the names of 1,695 fallen peace officers from the state of Texas, the most of any state, including 114 members of the Houston Police Department who gave their lives to keep their city safe. I include a list of these fallen heroes from Houston, Texas. Mr. Speaker, today there are more than 900,000 law enforcement personnel serving the people of our country, the highest amount ever. About 12 percent of them are female. These brave men and women risk their lives to keep the peace and keep us safe but they are too often taken by the violence they are working to prevent. Every year, a law enforcement officer is killed somewhere in the United States every 60 hours, and there are also 58,930 assaults against our law officers each year, resulting in 15,404 injuries. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Law Enforcement Caucus I am proud to represent the people of the 18th Congressional District of Texas in paying tribute to the 123 fallen heroes who will be joining the 20,789 gallant men and women who gave the last full measure of devotion to the communities they took an oath to protect and serve. In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me pay tribute to one of the finest public servants America has produced, Lee Patrick Brown, who is perhaps best known to the law enforcement community as the ``The Father of Community Policing.'' Lee Brown was appointed in 1982 as the first African-American Chief of Police of the Houston Police Department, where he pioneered techniques in community policing to reduce crime that still used throughout the country today. Lee Brown enjoyed a long and distinguished career leading several of the nation's most important and largest police departments, including those of Atlanta, Georgia, and New York City, before becoming the first African American Mayor of Houston, Texas in 1997. Following Lee Brown as Chief of the Houston Police Department were the following good and true public servants: Elizabeth Watson (1990- 1992); Sam Nuchia (1992-1997); Clarence Bradford (1997-2004); Harold Hunt (2004-2009); and Charles McClelland (2010-2016). Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in memory of the officers whose names will be added to the National Peace Officers Memorial Wall of Honor.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor, and I also rise to challenge. My honoring is to acknowledge the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and to honor those who have fallen in battle, and to acknowledge the fact that an officer is killed somewhere in the United States every 60 hours, and there are also 58,930 assaults and 15,404 injuries. So I salute those who have fallen and offer my sympathy to their families, but I recognize that it is important to honor them, and we do honor them. That is why I rise today with sadness on what we did on the floor of the House, where we actually said to the LGBT community that serve in the United States military or by contracting work serve the United States Government, that you are not equal. How sad that is. I am looking forward to this House, next week, overturning that dastardly provision that says that one American who comes under the Constitution is not equal. Finally, let me say that we are suffering from the possibility of the Zika virus, and this House must fully fund for the Zika virus epidemic that is coming. Mr. Speaker, this week the nation observes National Police Week, as we have since President John F. Kennedy first proclaimed National Peace Officers Memorial Day on May 15, 1962. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial is the nation's monument to law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty. Dedicated on October 15, 1991, the Memorial honors federal, state and local law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and protection of our nation and its people. Carved on its walls are the names of 20,789 officers who have been killed in the line of duty throughout U.S. history, dating back to the first known death in 1791. Added to the Wall this year will be the names of the 123 police officers killed in the line of duty in 2015. Mr. Speaker, enshrined on the Memorial Wall of Honor also are the names of 1,695 fallen peace officers from the state of Texas, the most of any state, including 114 members of the Houston Police Department who gave their lives to keep their city safe. I include a list of these fallen heroes from Houston, Texas. Mr. Speaker, today there are more than 900,000 law enforcement personnel serving the people of our country, the highest amount ever. About 12 percent of them are female. These brave men and women risk their lives to keep the peace and keep us safe but they are too often taken by the violence they are working to prevent. Every year, a law enforcement officer is killed somewhere in the United States every 60 hours, and there are also 58,930 assaults against our law officers each year, resulting in 15,404 injuries. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Law Enforcement Caucus I am proud to represent the people of the 18th Congressional District of Texas in paying tribute to the 123 fallen heroes who will be joining the 20,789 gallant men and women who gave the last full measure of devotion to the communities they took an oath to protect and serve. In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me pay tribute to one of the finest public servants America has produced, Lee Patrick Brown, who is perhaps best known to the law enforcement community as the ``The Father of Community Policing.'' Lee Brown was appointed in 1982 as the first African-American Chief of Police of the Houston Police Department, where he pioneered techniques in community policing to reduce crime that still used throughout the country today. Lee Brown enjoyed a long and distinguished career leading several of the nation's most important and largest police departments, including those of Atlanta, Georgia, and New York City, before becoming the first African American Mayor of Houston, Texas in 1997. Following Lee Brown as Chief of the Houston Police Department were the following good and true public servants: Elizabeth Watson (1990- 1992); Sam Nuchia (1992-1997); Clarence Bradford (1997-2004); Harold Hunt (2004-2009); and Charles McClelland (2010-2016). Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in memory of the officers whose names will be added to the National Peace Officers Memorial Wall of Honor.

sam nuchia (1992-1997); clarence bradford (1997-2004); harold hunt (2004-2009); and charles mcclelland (2010-2016). mr. speaker, i ask for a moment of silence in memory of the officers whose names will be added to the national peace officers memorial wall of honor. houston law enforcement officers memorialized on the wall of honor 1. timothy scott abernethy, end of watch: december 7, 2008, houston, texas, p.d. 2. charles h baker, end of watch: august 16, 1979, houston, texas, p.d. 3. johnny terrell bamsch, end of watch: january 30, 1975, houston, texas, p.d. 4. claude r beck, end of watch: december 10, 1971, houston, texas, p.d. 5. jack b beets, end of watch: march 30, 1955, houston, texas, p.d. 6. troy a blando, end of watch: may 19, 1999, houston, texas, p.d. 7. james charles boswell, end of watch: december 9, 1989, houston, texas, p.d. 8. c e branon, end of watch: march 20, 1959, houston, texas, p.d. 9. john m cain, end of watch: august 3, 1911, houston, texas, p.d. 10. richard h calhoun, end of watch: october 10, 1975, houston texas police department. 11 dionicio m camacho, end of watch: october 23, 2009, harris county, texas, s.o. 12. henry canales, end of watch: june 23, 2009, houston, texas, p.d. 13. frank manuel cantu jr, end of watch: march 25, 2004, houston, texas, p.d. 14. e c chavez, end of watch: september 17, 1925, houston, texas, p.d. 15. charles roy clark, end of watch: april 3, 2003, houston, texas, p.d. 16. charles robert coates ii, end of watch: february 23, 1983, houston, texas, p.d. 17. pete corrales, end of watch: january 25, 1925, houston, texas, p.d. 18. rufus e daniels, end of watch: august 23, 1917, houston, texas, p.d. 19. johnnie davidson, end of watch: february 19, 1921, houston, texas, p.d. 20. worth davis, end of watch: june 17, 1928, houston, texas, p.d. 21. keith alan dees, end of watch: march 7, 2002, houston, texas, p.d. 22. reuben becerra deleon, jr, end of watch: october 26, 2005, houston, texas, p.d. 23. william edwin deleon, end of watch: march 29, 1982, houston, texas, p.d. 24. floyd t deloach jr, end of watch: june 30, 1965, houston, texas, p.d. 25. george d edwards, end of watch: june 30, 1939, houston, texas, p.d. 26. dawn suzanne erickson, end of watch: december 24, 1995, houston, texas, p.d. 27. j c etheridge, end of watch: august 23, 1924, houston, texas, p.d. 28. james e fenn, end of watch: march 14, 1891, houston, texas, p.d.

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to recognize the remarkable career of Lauren Morris Schulman. After more than 13 years, Ms. Schulman is retiring as the Florida political director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC, the largest pro-Israel advocacy organization in the country. Lauren began her political career 26 years ago and served in a variety of positions with the late Congressman Bill Lehman, E. Clay Shaw, Jr., Florida State Senator Gwen Margolis, and Miami-Dade County Commissioner Sally Heyman. Lauren has adroitly mobilized and engaged Florida's pro-Israel community. She has led our citizen activists in building relationships with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, key to the success of the pro-Israel movement. Lauren has helped all Floridians understand how, against all odds, Israel has become a prospering democracy whose groundbreaking contributions in technology, medicine, and environmental innovation have benefited the world. Lauren's commitment to our community and the State of Israel is exemplary, and I am proud to call her my constituent and good friend. Our loss is her husband Cliff's and her family's gain.

CREC-2016-05-19-pt1-PgH2871-3,CREC-2016-05-19,114,ISSUES OF THE DAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2871-H2877] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is amazing sometimes the way, in the heat of dispute, argument--sometimes [[Page H2872]] any of us can have it happen to us--people don't think clearly. I have been here for nearly 11\1/2\ years in Congress. It is a tremendous honor to get to be the servant for the people of east Texas. But in that 11\1/2\ years, 4 of them the Democrats were in the majority, and my friend from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) was the majority leader during those 4 years, and the rules never changed with regard to how the electronic voting worked. For the last 11\1/2\ years, it has always been the same. And that is, we could take our voting card--and it has a little computer chip in it. It doesn't matter which we way put our card in the box. If the blue light on the box is lit, it means that box is open for voting. Most every other row has a voting box on the back. We take our card, and we put it in the slot whichever way. It recognizes the one-of-a-kind computer chip that belongs to that 1 of 435 Members, and then you can hit the green button for ``yea,'' the red button the ``nay,'' the yellow button for ``present.'' The blue light is on there. It is next in order on the box, but it can't be pushed. It just lets you know the box is open for voting. Toward the end of a vote, particularly a 15-minute vote, the Speaker will not have gaveled the vote dead, but oftentimes the box goes dead right before the gavel comes down. Even to that point, you can still change your vote, but it is just when the blue light goes out, you can't do it at the box. You have to come down to the well. What I have noticed every year for the last 11\1/2\ years that I have been here, if we are voting on a 15-minute vote--and all of us have probably done it at one time or another--if you need to change your vote, maybe you looked up and, for example, sometimes one person has multiple amendments, and you see their name and it is their amendment, and you say, ``Oh, I was not going to vote for that,'' and you vote ``no'' and you need to change your vote to ``yes,'' you can still change your vote at the box. On a 15-minute vote, once you get past 5 minutes, you normally have to come down to the well and get a green card for ``yea,'' a red card for ``nay,'' or a yellow card for ``present'' or ``abstaining'' and change your vote that way. But on a 5-minute vote or a 2-minute vote, if you need to change your vote, you didn't understand the significance, it constantly happens that people change their vote. {time} 1245 But to change their vote, if you have your voting card, you have been able to change it at the box on a 5-minute vote or a 2-minute vote. Every now and then, before the gavel comes down, the blue light will go off on the box, so you can no longer change your vote or vote at that box. That is when you hear someone yelling, ``One more, one more,'' and they come rushing down the aisle to get the vote in before the gavel comes down. Now, in 11\1/2\ years, only one time has there been a massive and gross violation of the rules the way we have followed them in bringing a vote to a conclusion. I can understand my friend from Maryland being sensitive, because this happened on his watch as majority leader. But Republicans were in the minority, and yet there was a vote. I don't even remember if it was a bill or an amendment. I think it was an amendment. But the Republicans voting against the amendment had enough Democrats voting with us that we were bringing down a Democratic amendment or bill, and it was left open for enough time that anybody that wanted to change could have changed. When the Democrat in the chair felt that enough time had passed, no other changes were being made, and the measure being voted on had failed, then the gavel came down. The rule has always been that when the gavel comes down, there can be no further changing of the vote. Perhaps, the majority leader, at that time Hoyer, had forgotten. But that was the time they violated their own rules. A subsequent investigation confirmed that. They violated the rules and allowed someone whose arm they were twisting to vote after the gavel came down to change the vote, change the outcome of the vote. That didn't happen here today. And the vote wasn't held open very long at all after the end of the time running out. Sometimes, whether it is Democrats or Republicans in the majority, it runs to zero. But if, in the opinion of the Chair or the Speaker, there is somebody wanting to change their vote or somebody that is making a good faith effort to get here to vote, they will leave the vote open. Sometimes, like when Speaker Pelosi was meeting with President Obama at the White House and wasn't getting back in time, or Majority Leader Hoyer, and they weren't getting back in time, well, that vote would be held open to give them time well beyond the zero, zero, zero, so they could cast that vote. Nobody objected because we knew they were making a good faith effort to get here. I understand sometimes we forget things that we have been doing for a number of years. And especially in the heat of debate and a verbal battle here on the floor, people can forget what they have been doing for many, many years. But that has been the way the voting and the rules on voting have worked and been interpreted for many years. So I was greatly surprised to hear the former majority leader challenging on the basis that people didn't come into the well to change their vote on either a 5-minute or a 2-minute vote. Well, they have always been able to change their vote. The voting boxes were open. Anyway, we all have those mental lapses where we forget things that we have been doing for years. I mean, it just happens, and especially here on the floor. There is nothing to be taken from former Majority Leader Hoyer forgetting how the rules were when he was majority leader and forgetting how they have been all these years since, so no hard feelings. He just had a mental lapse and forgot how the rules have been ever since he has been here the entire time. There has been a great deal of to-do and a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth about what I would term the ``Iranian crisis'' because it truly is a crisis that this administration has enabled Iran to go ahead and develop nuclear weapons to continue down that path. Even though they are supposed to be prohibited, they continued to develop missiles that eventually will be capable of delivering nuclear weapons onto the United States. They have got missiles to deliver them on to Israel right now. But as Prime Minister Netanyahu so ably has pointed out from this very rostrum right up here, those missiles they are developing now are not for Israel. They can already reach Israel. Those are for the Great Satan. So it was deeply troubling to hear the confessions and admissions of the White House adviser consultant mouthpiece, Ben Rhodes, reveal that the administration--and I am being careful not to use any specific names. I am addressing generally the administration--that the administration had to lie to the American people and had to lie to the House and Senate about how evil Iran really was and had to talk about how moderate they were when, actually, the fact is, apparently, under the so-called moderate President Rouhani, there have been more people put to death than even under the former President Ahmadinejad. This man is no moderate. Though the American people were fed lies about the negotiations, they were having to negotiate, either directly or indirectly, with the Ayatollah Khamenei. They don't make big decisions like a nuclear weapons deal, unless the religious leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, actually agreed, just like his predecessor, the Ayatollah Khomeini. So just like with the revelations about ObamaCare, now that we have had someone working behind the scenes with the administration who revealed, yes, the reason ObamaCare passed was because people are such fools, they were able to fool them into voting for a bill that was really not anything like what was being represented. And yet along comes Ben Rhodes, and he admits they did the same thing on ObamaCare that they did on the Iranian treaty. Now, I understand the administration has never called it a treaty, and there are people in the Senate who have not had the courage to call it a treaty, but it is a treaty. You can't change a nuclear proliferation treaty [[Page H2873]] with an executive agreement or an executive order. It can't be done. It has to be done with another treaty. So, clearly, there are a number of things that made clear that the Iranian deal was a treaty. It should have been brought to the floor of the Senate. It still should be. It is time. You can do it any time this year. You could do it with 51 votes of the Senate setting aside cloture and saying, the Iranian treaty is a treaty, it is going to allow Iran to have nuclear weapons that will allow them to devastate both the Little Satan, in their opinion Israel, and the Great Satan, the United States, and it needs to be stopped. So, hopefully, the courage will abound eventually in the Senate and we will get that vote. And therefore, people with standing could go to court and stop the flood of millions of dollars to Iran, which has already said that with the billions of dollars, $100 billion to $150 billion in the first year this administration is going to make available, they are going to commit so much more to terrorism than they ever had. Then we get this story just a few days ago from the Washington Free Beacon entitled, Iran Shows Off Third Underground Missile Site. It says: ``Iran's military recently publicized a third underground missile facility and showed the launch of a new ballistic missile through the top of a mountain. ``It was the third time since October that Tehran showed off an extensive network of underground missile facilities. The new video, however, for the first time, shows a missile launch from one of the country's underground launch facilities. ``Disclosure of the new video comes as Iran this week conducted the third launch of a ballistic missile since January, when the nuclear deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear weapons development went into effect.'' And I would submit, that part of the story is inaccurate. It is being considered to have gone into effect, but it is a treaty that was never ratified by the U.S. Senate, and it is an ineffective treaty. But the Obama administration is choosing to act as if the Iranian agreement really is an effective treaty. Iran has shown they have no intention of following that agreement. They have violated it a number of times. And the only reason Iran would have the gall to go forward and say, Hey, look, we have got a third underground missile site, we are going to let you see a launch, we don't care that the world knows that we are violating this last agreement with Obama and Kerry and Wendy Sherman that helped give North Korea nuclear weapons in the Clinton administration, we don't care that they know because we have now seen that this administration will not stand up to us, they will let us push them around, they will even let us take their soldiers or their naval officers, their naval seamen captive, violate virtually every treaty on the treatment of prisoners, humiliate the American sailors, force them to lie on camera, and after all that is said and done, we will get the Secretary of State to come back and thank us. I mean, it is like from ``Animal House,'' Kevin Bacon being beaten saying, Thank you, sir, may I have another? Iran has figured out they are the senior pledges, and this administration will take a beating and keep asking, Thank you, sir, may I have another? And Iran is all that willing to give them another and another. The trouble is this isn't a comedy movie, this is real life. Christians and Jews are being targeted, persecuted, and killed in greater numbers than at any time in the history of the world. The Middle East is on fire, except Israel is a place of stability. But if this administration has its will, it will become a powder keg before long as well. Libya had become more stable. And after the United States went into Iraq, because Saddam Hussein continued to refuse to abide by the orders of the U.N. that were passed by huge majorities, requiring them to disclose what they had, he wouldn't comply, most everybody was-- including those who now say, I voted for it, I really wasn't for it-- but, at the time, people thought, look, this guy must have something to hide because he is certainly not letting us get in to see what weapons he has. Other reports indicate that they had been taken from Iraq and were no longer present. But either way, it scared Qadhafi enough that, as some of the Israeli leaders have told me, we were shocked when you provided the firepower, the planes, and the bombs that made it possible to eliminate Qadhafi because, yeah, he had blood on his hands before 2003, but after 2003, he helped you more in fighting terrorism than anybody but us, and you took him out, and look what happened as a result. {time} 1300 It turned Egypt upside down. There are problems in Albania, problems all over North Africa, problems for the Middle East and North Africa both, problems coming down now of radical Islamists in Nigeria and other, more central African countries. They have paid a heavy price for the improper leadership of this administration here in the United States. It is just tragic how many have lost their lives already. Then we hear reports that in Nigeria--and I heard it when I was in Nigeria and was trying to help the Nigerian families whose daughters had been abducted--that this administration, behind the scenes, was saying: Look, we will help you with Boko Haram, with the terrorism-- although they don't like to use that word--with the radical extremism that is occurring in Nigeria. If you will change your laws, violate your religious beliefs, allow same-sex marriage, and pay for abortion, then we will help you. As one Nigerian Catholic bishop said: Our religious beliefs are not for sale, not to the U.S. President, not to anybody. I have an article that goes on about the situation with Iran. This is also from May 12: ``Kerry's Peculiar Message About Iran for European Banks.'' It reads: ``U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Thursday in London with a group of European financial institutions for a discussion about `Iranian banking matters.' The meeting, which followed repeated complaints by Iranian officials that they aren't getting the benefit of the bargain under the nuclear deal, was an effort by the State Department to persuade major non-U.S. banks that doing Iran-related business is not only permitted following the relaxation of Iran sanctions, but is actually encouraged. ``The irony will not be lost on these financial institutions. Most of them were similarly gathered almost 10 years ago by U.S. Treasury Henry Paulson to discuss Iranian banking matters, but that discussion focused on protecting the integrity of the global financial system against the risk posed by Iran. ``In the decade that followed, the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, as well as the U.K. and other governments, the European Union, and the United Nations, all imposed extensive sanctions targeting Iran's illicit and deceptive conduct. Banks were briefed extensively and repeatedly by the U.S. Treasury Department on the details of Iran's conduct. The Financial Action Task Force, the global standard-setting body for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, warned about the financial crime risks posed by Iran as a jurisdiction. The result: Iran became a financial pariah. ``No one has claimed that Iran has ceased to engage in much of the same conduct for which it was sanctioned, including actively supporting terrorism and building and testing ballistic missiles; but now Washington is pushing non-U.S. banks to do what is still illegal for American banks to do. ``This is a very odd position for the U.S. Government to be taking.'' It is shocking that this administration continues to be complicit with the largest supporter of terrorism in the world. How many lives will be lost because of this complicity? There was a time when America would not tolerate the kind of treatment of Americans that occurred to our seamen when they were taken captive. Not only did we not come to their defense, we praised Iran and thanked them for being so gracious for the manner in which they abused our sailors. This article goes on. It reads: ``On the one hand, Washington is continuing to prohibit American banks and companies from doing Iran-related business. In February, the FATF''--that is the Financial Action Task [[Page H2874]] Force--``reaffirmed its prior concerns about the 'serious threat' Iran poses to the international financial system, urging countries to apply effective countermeasures. The U.S. Treasury Department's designation of Iran, including its central bank and financial institutions, as a primary money laundering concern also still stands. As part of that designation, Treasury determined that `the international financial system is increasingly vulnerable to the risk that otherwise responsible financial institutions will, unwittingly, participate in Iran's illicit activities.' ``On the other hand, Mr. Kerry wants non-U.S. banks to do business with Iran without a U.S. repudiation of its prior statements about the associated financial crime risks. There are no assurances as to how such activity would subsequently be viewed by U.S. regulatory and law enforcement authorities, which might seek to take enforcement action against banks that enter the Iranian market and run afoul of complicated U.S. restrictions. The State Department neither controls nor plays any meaningful role in the enforcement decisions of these authorities. ``Washington has warned repeatedly that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps controls broad swaths of the Iranian economy. The IRGC remains sanctioned by both the United States and the European Union because of the central role it plays in Iran's illicit conduct. When the U.S., EU, and U.N. removed sanctions from several hundred Iranian banks and companies, there were no assurances that the conduct of those banks and companies had changed. ``This will present a challenge for European banks. HSBC is endeavoring to implement consistent and high standards across its global operations, designed to combat financial crime and prevent abuse by illicit actors. We have more work to do, but achieving that objective is one of our highest priorities. This approach is rightly expected by our regulators, including in the U.K. and the U.S. ``Our decisions will be driven by the financial crime risks and the underlying conduct. For these reasons, HSBC has no intention of doing any new business involving Iran. Governments can lift sanctions, but the private sector is still responsible for managing its own risk and, no doubt, will be held accountable if it falls short.'' That was from May 12, and it appears to be somebody who certainly knows the banking business. I would like to comment a bit about, again, our illegal immigration problems and our porous borders because the administration continues to act as if all is well--all is well--when it is not well. An article from May 19: ``Previously Deported Illegal Alien Allegedly Killed Prom Teen.'' ``The man that Houston police say was driving drunk and evading arrest when he crashed into a car, killing a young woman on her way home from the prom, is listed by Federal officials as a previously deported illegal alien.'' ``Edin Palacios-Rodas, a 27-year-old previously deported illegal alien from Guatemala, has now had an immigration detainer placed on him after being processed into the Harris County Jail on one count of felony murder and one count of felony evading resulting in death and serious bodily injury.'' It is still going on. With that going on, this administration continues to push for and has allies in Congress pushing for what they are calling sentencing reform when, actually, it won't be reform as much as it will be rather devastating. The pendulum on criminal justice swings back and forth. Most history shows that it has always been and probably will always be, whether a totalitarian government or a democratic republic such as ours. My friend in the Senate, Senator Jeff Sessions, has an article, again, from May 19 that reads: ``Senator Jeff Sessions warns that Congress must be careful to ensure the sentencing reductions bills pending before Congress did not boost already rising crime rates and `sign death warrants' for innocent victims.'' ``The Sentencing Reform and Correction Act, which the Alabama Republican opposes, hews to Obama's anti-law enforcement agenda and could cost an enormous human toll, Senator Sessions said. `Frankly, this is Obama's policy and the Attorney General who he's appointed, Loretta Lynch's policy, and Eric Holder's before her, to basically cut people's sentences that have been lawfully imposed throughout this country, and it's impacting public safety and will continue to do so in the future.' ``The Senator also highlighted many high-profile cop killings as the Obama administration makes police work more difficult. ``He said, `In the last year, we've lost 123 police officers, 35 in the first 4 months of 2016. Violent crimes and murders have increased across the country at alarming rates. Let me just share with my colleagues some of the things we're seeing in violent crime. Recently, the Major Cities Chiefs of Police Association, a long-established group, called an emergency meeting to deal with the numbers I'm going to share with you today.' ``The numbers I will quote represent the percentage increase in total murders in the first quarter of this year, 2016, over the first quarter . . . of 2015. Las Vegas: 82 percent increase.'' This is the murder increase. ``Dallas, Texas: 73 percent increase. Chicago: 70 percent. Jacksonville, Florida: 67 percent. Newark, New Jersey: 60 percent increase. Miami-Dade: 38 percent. Los Angeles: 33 percent.'' And on and on. ``These are substantial increases in crime. According to FBI statistics released just this year, the number of violent crimes committed across the country was up in the first half of 2015 compared with the same period of 2014.'' So, actually, we are going up and up, and the percentage increase in these cities of 82 percent, 73 percent, and a 70 percent increase is even more dramatic than that when you go back 2 years. Sessions also quoted FBI Director James Comey's concerns about the rising tide of crime. `` `I was very worried about it last fall, and I am, in many ways, more worried because the numbers are not only going up, they're continuing to go up in most of those cities faster than they were going up last year. Something is happening. I don't know what the answer is, but, holy cow, do we have a problem.''' Yes, we do have a problem. One of the answers is mentioned in this article, again, from May 19, entitled: ``Obama doesn't think rapists, armed robbers, drug dealers are criminals.'' I think I found the euphemism of the year. ``According to Team Obama, criminals should now be declared `justice- involved individuals.' ``The neo-Orwellianism comes to us from the bizarre flurry of last- minute dictates, regulations, and bone-chilling threats, collectively known to fanboys as Obama's Gorgeous Good-bye. ``In another of those smiley faced but deeply sinister `dear colleague' letters sent to universities and colleges this week, Obama's Education Secretary, John King, discouraged colleges from asking applicants whether they were convicted criminals.'' {time} 1315 It used to be a matter of common sense. Most Americans wanted to know. Especially in dormitories that have now become co-ed, where you have men and women living in and with and around each other, it was considered valuable information to know if your daughter was going to be living in, around, or with a convicted rapist. That was thought to be good information, but apparently that is no longer considered by this administration as good information. People all across America have shown an interest in knowing whether there are child molesters in their neighborhood where their children are growing up and children are playing around the area. They want to know if their child is at risk because they know there is a significant recidivism rate, particularly among child molesters. Yet, this administration says it is time to stop calling criminals criminals. Again, that is in keeping with the unwillingness to call radical Islamist, as the Muslim leader of Egypt, our friend, President el-Sisi, calls it--I mean, it is radical Islamists. He has had the courage to tell imams themselves that we have to get control again of Islam and wrestle it back away from the radical Islamists. [[Page H2875]] As my friend, Carolyn Glick, pointed out in The Jerusalem Post, by this administration's refusal to call radical Islam radical Islam, it betrays our allies who are Muslim--like President el-Sisi in Egypt--who are wanting Muslims to stand up and say that these Islamists should not be allowed to represent our religion because they know that they do. When you have a man with multiple degrees in Islamic studies saying that, yes, radical Islam is the ultimate Islam and, on the other hand, you have a President who did go to school in Indonesia in Muslim schools and elementary school but does not have any degrees in Islamic studies, like the world expert in Islamic studies, al-Qaradawi, well, one is President of the United States with no degrees in Islamic studies, and he says it is not Islam. But a man who has studied Islam his whole life and has multiple degrees, including a Ph.D., says not only is it Islam, as the head of ISIS as he is, this is Islam the way it should be. We should be giving assistance to our allies, giving them cover by not going on with this facade where this administration refuses to call radical Islam radical Islam. They call radical Islamic terrorism exactly what it is. They are not helping our friends around the world that are trying to stand up and do the right thing. You could go back to Libya, the attack of Benghazi. We now know from what has been gathered from emails and information that Secretary Clinton basically told the President of Libya: We know that this Benghazi attack was not on a video, in essence, and that it was a planned attack. She told her daughter. Yet, she went out, as did Susan Rice, representing this administration and told us all, oh, it was all about the video; telling victims families that we are going to get the guy who did the video. Victims families from Benghazi have told me personally, when Secretary Clinton said we are going to get the guys that did the videos, which she now says she didn't say--how tragic is that? So basically calling these victims' families liars. But the families say, when she said we will get the guy that did the video, they were infuriated. They said: We didn't care about the guy that did some video. We wanted our government to get the guys that killed our loved one, and that was not the message. You have to understand that there were a lot of things to do, there were promises to keep, and miles to go before they slept. But we don't know if they just went to bed and slept. When they found out the personal ambassador of the Secretary of State was missing, Clinton and President Obama, did they just go to bed? They won't tell us. We know President Obama had a very important engagement the next day. He had to fly out early to Las Vegas for a big campaign speech. We know. We understand. Hey, that was more pressing. We got that. We understand. To him, that was more pressing. What do you do? Do you go to sleep when you get word that your personal ambassador is missing? For the first time since 1979, an ambassador ends up being killed. He wasn't given adequate protection. Now, we are hearing more and more reports from people that the assets were there to go help. They could have saved at least two, maybe more of the four, but they were not allowed go and save the American heroes. Well, there is an article from Conservative Review entitled ``Busted: The 10 Most Dangerous Myths About Criminal Justice Reform'' that is being pushed especially by this administration. And we do have some colleagues here in the House and Senate that are as well. ``Myth number one: The prison population keeps growing, even though crime is declining.'' ``Fact: The D.C. intelligentsia argues our criminal justice system is in dire need of reform. But ask anyone outside the beltway, and they'll give you a different definition of `broken.' Many Americans would agree that current laws are too lenient on criminals and disregard the victim all too often. It was the tough reforms put into place during the Reagan years and in the '90s that produced the sharpest decline in violent crime on record. Those reforms, coupled with more aggressive policing, led to the only positive social trend in public policy in recent memory. That trend is now being reversed precisely as incarceration rates decline and Obama and his allies ratchet up the war against law enforcement. While correlation doesn't necessarily prove causation, the correlation is indeed striking and in conjunction with the defanging of local police departments, the release of tens of thousands of Federal prisoners can only result in exacerbating this negative trajectory.'' From the information that the FBI provided to Senator Sessions, we know about maybe less than 1 percent of Federal inmates in Federal prison are there for possession of a controlled substance; that most are there for more. Ninety-nine percent or so are there for more than that. But those that have been involved in the criminal justice system, both in the State side, as I was, and on the Federal side--I mean, we work with each other. And we know the Federal Government never had interest, that I ever saw, in simple possession cases. Where the Federal Government had interest is if a real bad guy--maybe he had been involved in a shooting, a killing, a robbing, a possession--but they wanted him to turn on his boss so they could get the bigger fish. They had to offer something to get him to turn, and they would offer--I have seen it many times--okay, we can't have a plea agreement where we set a certain sentence, as they do in State court, but what we can do is agree to drop all the charges, except this one possession. So the sentence is not that great. Whatever the judge does won't be that great. It won't have the weapons charge in there, even though he used a weapon and engaged in violent activity, if he will help us get Mr. Big. That happens. I have seen it happened. Back in the early '80s, when I was court appointed in Federal court, I had approaches like that with regard to my clients: What can you help us with, and here are the charges we are willing to drop, even though we know we can prove them. Yet, this administration acts like that never happens and that, obviously, all these people in prison because of drug charges are really nonviolent. That is garbage. That is why the crime rate keeps going up as this administration forces the release of more and more people. This article points out another myth: ``There are millions of people incarcerated in American prisons for no good reason.'' ``Fact: While there are approximately 1.5 million people incarcerated in American jails, prisons, and other institutions, only 195,900 are Federal inmates (a 10-year low). And only 159,000 in the Federal system are housed in actual prisons. The rest are in privately managed facilities, home confinement, short-term detention, long-term boarders, residential reentry centers, pretrial/presentence holding, et cetera. At least 25 percent of the Federal prison population is comprised of illegal aliens and possibly more who are noncitizens. We should save money by releasing those criminals and deporting them.'' What good does it do to deport somebody now when the border is so wide open? ``Myth number 3: Incarceration costs so much money and criminal justice reform will save billions.'' Well, without reading through the whole article, I can tell you that is garbage as well. Myth number 4: ``This bill will only release low level, nonviolent drug offenders.'' As I pointed out, that is simply not the case. It is a good article. Myth number 5: ``We have a big government culture of overcriminalization that threatens liberty.'' Well, the biggest problem of overcriminalization is when Congress has passed a law that says you can go to prison for violating any of the regulations regarding this subject, and then bureaucrats in some cubicle somewhere put some regulations in place under this administration--sometimes 80,000 pages of new regulations a year--and people, as the Heritage Foundation has said before in one of their books, are probably all violating three or four Federal laws a day. One other thing I wanted to touch on because it has been debated and a lot of [[Page H2876]] allegations made, people are trying to assert that Republicans somehow are supportive of the old ways of slavery. Mr. Speaker, I just want to read from the Democratic Party Platform of 1856. This is a part of the platform. This is the belief of the Democratic Party, the national party: ``That Congress has no power under the Constitution, to interfere with or control the domestic institutions of the several States, and that such States are the sole and proper judges of everything appertaining to their own affairs, not prohibited by the Constitution; that all efforts of the abolitionists''--that is those who wanted to end slavery--``or others, made to induce Congress to interfere with questions of slavery . . . are calculated to lead to the most alarming and dangerous consequences; and that all such efforts''--talking about the end of slavery--``have an inevitable tendency to diminish the happiness of the people and endanger the stability and permanency of the Union, and ought not to be countenanced by any friend of our political institutions.'' The Democratic Party Platform of 1856 also declares that ``new States'' to the Union should be admitted ``with or without domestic slavery, as the State may elect.'' The Platform that year also says that ``we recognize the right of the people of all the Territories . . . to form a Constitution, with or without domestic slavery.'' {time} 1330 The platform of 1860 of the national Democratic Party, in seeking to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act, states: ``The enactments of the State legislatures to defeat the faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Act are hostile in character, subversive of the Constitution, and revolutionary in their effect.'' The 14th Amendment, giving full citizenship to freed slaves, passed in 1868 with 94 percent Republican support and zero percent Democratic support in Congress. The 15th Amendment, giving freed slaves the right to vote, passed in 1870 with 100 percent Republican support and zero percent Democratic support in Congress. The Constitution of 1902 in the State of Virginia disenfranchised about 90 percent of the Black men who still voted at the beginning of the 20th century and nearly half of the White men. The number of eligible African American voters fell from about 147,000 in 1901 to about 10,000 by 1905. The measure was supported almost entirely by Virginia State Democrats. In 1924, the Democratic National Convention convened in New York at Madison Square Garden. The convention is commonly known as the Klanbake due to the overwhelming influence of the Ku Klux Klan in the party. In 1964, the Democratic Party led a 75-day filibuster against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Leading the Democrats in their opposition to civil rights for African Americans was a member of the Democratic Party, Senator Robert Byrd from West Virginia, who was known to be a recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan. Senator Byrd spoke directly about the Civil Rights Act in a 14-hour filibuster, proclaiming: ``Men are not equal today, and they were not created equal in 1776, when the Declaration of Independence was written. Men and races of men differ in appearance, ways, physical power, mental capacity, creativity, and vision.'' The Democratic Party identified itself as the ``White man's party'' and demonized the Republican Party as being dominated by African Americans. So it is interesting to hear these rewritten parts of our history. When you know the hearts and minds of the people on the Republican side of the aisle, you find out there is nobody who wants slavery. We wish that slavery that held this Nation back--because as Daniel Webster used to preach and John Quincy Adams used to preach, how was a good God going to keep blessing America when we were treating brothers and sisters in Christ this way, putting them in chains and bondage? America was harmed. It was devastating to African American lives to be placed in slavery--the degradation, the humiliation. I am grateful to be part of the party that stood up and made the change. But more than the Republican Party, the Judeo-Christian beliefs, especially in the 1700s after the Great Awakening, the First Great Awakening in America, revival in America where people turned to God, became Christians, they understood travesties better by understanding the Bible. They stood up, and they demanded equal rights for people, and it led to a revolution. In the 1800s, there was a lot of debauchery, but during the Second Great Awakening, churches were really the core behind the abolitionist movement. We should never be putting brothers and sisters in chains. That is an abomination. It held America back. It helped greatly prevent America from reaching the heights that it would once slavery was gone. But then even after slavery was gone, as a result of the great Republican father of our party, Abraham Lincoln, as he is sometimes referred to, people were not treated equally. As I just read, even in Virginia, this great State of Virginia, Democrats were determined to prevent African Americans from voting, and they were successful in large degree. Mr. Speaker, I think a good way to finish today is to go back to the final argument. We have the entire final argument from John Quincy Adams. He was elected President in 1824. He was defeated by Andrew Jackson in 1828. But in 1830 he did an incredible thing that no one has ever done since. After being President, he ran for Congress, for the House of Representatives. He didn't even run for Senate. He ran for the House of Representatives. He believed God was calling him. As William Wilberforce believed God had called him to bring an end to slavery in Great Britain, Adams believed God was calling him back into government after being defeated as President, that he would lower himself to run for the House of Representatives. He got elected in 1830. Speech after speech was against slavery. How can we expect God to bless America when we are treating brothers and sisters with chains and bondage? Sermons were so powerful that those sermons given against slavery, as he filed bills to end slavery, to free specific slaves over and over, those sermons he preached on the floor of the House right down the hall had a powerful impact on a homely-looking guy with an unpleasant sounding voice named Abraham Lincoln. He overlapped briefly before the massive stroke that took John Quincy Adams out. Adams knew when he died back in the Speaker's suite that he had not done what he thought God had called him to do--end slavery. It was 1848. But we now know, and Lincoln knew and said as much, as Steve Mansfield was telling me. He wrote a great book on Lincoln's struggle with God. He knew that those speeches on the House floor down the hall, they didn't end slavery, but they materially changed the attitude and affected that man named Abraham Lincoln that, 13 years after Adams would die, he would see to slavery's end. At the end of his argument, he was afraid he had not prevailed on behalf of Africans who were taken as captives by another African tribe, sold into slavery, and taken to the African coast. They were put on a ship and taken to the Caribbean, where they were put on a smaller ship called the Amistad. ``Amistad'' is a great movie. Longview, Texas, native Matthew McConaughey plays the trial lawyer representing the Africans. Their position was: We are not anybody's property. When the Africans took over the ship, landed accidentally in America, the Spanish said: These people are our property, and this ship is ours. Let us go. The Africans' version: Hey, we are not anybody's property. We want to go home. That case was argued downstairs in the old Supreme Court Chamber. Adams knew if he didn't do an adequate job, those Africans would leave in chains, their children would wear chains; and he was scared to death that he would not have been up to the job, and, as a result, there would be more suffering. We have his exact argument. He finished like this. This is after he had been President. He said: ``Little did I imagine that I should ever again be required to claim the right of appearing in the capacity of an officer of this Court; yet such has been the dictate of my destiny--and I [[Page H2877]] appear again to plead the cause of justice, and now of liberty and life, in behalf of many of my fellow men, before that same Court, which in a former age I had addressed in support of rights of property I stand again, I trust for the last time, before the same Court.'' He goes on to say: ``I stand before the same Court, but not before the same judges--nor aided by the same associates--nor resisted by the same opponents. As I cast my eyes--`` he stood looking at the judges-- ``along those seats of honor and of public trust, now occupied by you, they seek in vain for one of those honored and honorable persons whose indulgence listened then to my voice. Marshall--Cushing--Chase-- Washington--Johnson--Livingston--Todd--where are they? Where is that eloquent statesman and learned lawyer who was my associate counsel in the management of that cause, Robert Goodloe Harper? Where is that brilliant luminary, so long the pride of Maryland and of the American bar, then my opposing counsel, Luther Martin? Where is the excellent clerk of that day, whose name has been inscribed on the shores of Africa, as a monument of his abhorrence of the African slave-trade, Elias B. Caldwell? Where is the marshal--where are the criers of the Court? Alas. Where is one of the very judges of the Court, arbiters of life and death, before whom I commenced this anxious argument, even now prematurely closed? Where are they all? Gone. Gone. All gone--gone from the services which, in their day and generation, they faithfully rendered to their country. From the excellent characters which they sustained in life, so far as I have had the means of knowing, I humbly hope, and fondly trust, that they have gone to receive the rewards of blessedness on high. In taking, then, my final leave of this Bar, and of this honorable Court, I can only . . . ``a fervent petition to Heaven, that every member of it may go to his final account with as little of earthly frailty to answer for as those illustrious dead, and that you may, every one''--talking to the judges--``after the close of a long and virtuous career in this world, be received at the portals of the next with the approving sentence--`Well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' '' We should all hope as such. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2871-H2877] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is amazing sometimes the way, in the heat of dispute, argument--sometimes [[Page H2872]] any of us can have it happen to us--people don't think clearly. I have been here for nearly 11\1/2\ years in Congress. It is a tremendous honor to get to be the servant for the people of east Texas. But in that 11\1/2\ years, 4 of them the Democrats were in the majority, and my friend from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) was the majority leader during those 4 years, and the rules never changed with regard to how the electronic voting worked. For the last 11\1/2\ years, it has always been the same. And that is, we could take our voting card--and it has a little computer chip in it. It doesn't matter which we way put our card in the box. If the blue light on the box is lit, it means that box is open for voting. Most every other row has a voting box on the back. We take our card, and we put it in the slot whichever way. It recognizes the one-of-a-kind computer chip that belongs to that 1 of 435 Members, and then you can hit the green button for ``yea,'' the red button the ``nay,'' the yellow button for ``present.'' The blue light is on there. It is next in order on the box, but it can't be pushed. It just lets you know the box is open for voting. Toward the end of a vote, particularly a 15-minute vote, the Speaker will not have gaveled the vote dead, but oftentimes the box goes dead right before the gavel comes down. Even to that point, you can still change your vote, but it is just when the blue light goes out, you can't do it at the box. You have to come down to the well. What I have noticed every year for the last 11\1/2\ years that I have been here, if we are voting on a 15-minute vote--and all of us have probably done it at one time or another--if you need to change your vote, maybe you looked up and, for example, sometimes one person has multiple amendments, and you see their name and it is their amendment, and you say, ``Oh, I was not going to vote for that,'' and you vote ``no'' and you need to change your vote to ``yes,'' you can still change your vote at the box. On a 15-minute vote, once you get past 5 minutes, you normally have to come down to the well and get a green card for ``yea,'' a red card for ``nay,'' or a yellow card for ``present'' or ``abstaining'' and change your vote that way. But on a 5-minute vote or a 2-minute vote, if you need to change your vote, you didn't understand the significance, it constantly happens that people change their vote. {time} 1245 But to change their vote, if you have your voting card, you have been able to change it at the box on a 5-minute vote or a 2-minute vote. Every now and then, before the gavel comes down, the blue light will go off on the box, so you can no longer change your vote or vote at that box. That is when you hear someone yelling, ``One more, one more,'' and they come rushing down the aisle to get the vote in before the gavel comes down. Now, in 11\1/2\ years, only one time has there been a massive and gross violation of the rules the way we have followed them in bringing a vote to a conclusion. I can understand my friend from Maryland being sensitive, because this happened on his watch as majority leader. But Republicans were in the minority, and yet there was a vote. I don't even remember if it was a bill or an amendment. I think it was an amendment. But the Republicans voting against the amendment had enough Democrats voting with us that we were bringing down a Democratic amendment or bill, and it was left open for enough time that anybody that wanted to change could have changed. When the Democrat in the chair felt that enough time had passed, no other changes were being made, and the measure being voted on had failed, then the gavel came down. The rule has always been that when the gavel comes down, there can be no further changing of the vote. Perhaps, the majority leader, at that time Hoyer, had forgotten. But that was the time they violated their own rules. A subsequent investigation confirmed that. They violated the rules and allowed someone whose arm they were twisting to vote after the gavel came down to change the vote, change the outcome of the vote. That didn't happen here today. And the vote wasn't held open very long at all after the end of the time running out. Sometimes, whether it is Democrats or Republicans in the majority, it runs to zero. But if, in the opinion of the Chair or the Speaker, there is somebody wanting to change their vote or somebody that is making a good faith effort to get here to vote, they will leave the vote open. Sometimes, like when Speaker Pelosi was meeting with President Obama at the White House and wasn't getting back in time, or Majority Leader Hoyer, and they weren't getting back in time, well, that vote would be held open to give them time well beyond the zero, zero, zero, so they could cast that vote. Nobody objected because we knew they were making a good faith effort to get here. I understand sometimes we forget things that we have been doing for a number of years. And especially in the heat of debate and a verbal battle here on the floor, people can forget what they have been doing for many, many years. But that has been the way the voting and the rules on voting have worked and been interpreted for many years. So I was greatly surprised to hear the former majority leader challenging on the basis that people didn't come into the well to change their vote on either a 5-minute or a 2-minute vote. Well, they have always been able to change their vote. The voting boxes were open. Anyway, we all have those mental lapses where we forget things that we have been doing for years. I mean, it just happens, and especially here on the floor. There is nothing to be taken from former Majority Leader Hoyer forgetting how the rules were when he was majority leader and forgetting how they have been all these years since, so no hard feelings. He just had a mental lapse and forgot how the rules have been ever since he has been here the entire time. There has been a great deal of to-do and a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth about what I would term the ``Iranian crisis'' because it truly is a crisis that this administration has enabled Iran to go ahead and develop nuclear weapons to continue down that path. Even though they are supposed to be prohibited, they continued to develop missiles that eventually will be capable of delivering nuclear weapons onto the United States. They have got missiles to deliver them on to Israel right now. But as Prime Minister Netanyahu so ably has pointed out from this very rostrum right up here, those missiles they are developing now are not for Israel. They can already reach Israel. Those are for the Great Satan. So it was deeply troubling to hear the confessions and admissions of the White House adviser consultant mouthpiece, Ben Rhodes, reveal that the administration--and I am being careful not to use any specific names. I am addressing generally the administration--that the administration had to lie to the American people and had to lie to the House and Senate about how evil Iran really was and had to talk about how moderate they were when, actually, the fact is, apparently, under the so-called moderate President Rouhani, there have been more people put to death than even under the former President Ahmadinejad. This man is no moderate. Though the American people were fed lies about the negotiations, they were having to negotiate, either directly or indirectly, with the Ayatollah Khamenei. They don't make big decisions like a nuclear weapons deal, unless the religious leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, actually agreed, just like his predecessor, the Ayatollah Khomeini. So just like with the revelations about ObamaCare, now that we have had someone working behind the scenes with the administration who revealed, yes, the reason ObamaCare passed was because people are such fools, they were able to fool them into voting for a bill that was really not anything like what was being represented. And yet along comes Ben Rhodes, and he admits they did the same thing on ObamaCare that they did on the Iranian treaty. Now, I understand the administration has never called it a treaty, and there are people in the Senate who have not had the courage to call it a treaty, but it is a treaty. You can't change a nuclear proliferation treaty [[Page H2873]] with an executive agreement or an executive order. It can't be done. It has to be done with another treaty. So, clearly, there are a number of things that made clear that the Iranian deal was a treaty. It should have been brought to the floor of the Senate. It still should be. It is time. You can do it any time this year. You could do it with 51 votes of the Senate setting aside cloture and saying, the Iranian treaty is a treaty, it is going to allow Iran to have nuclear weapons that will allow them to devastate both the Little Satan, in their opinion Israel, and the Great Satan, the United States, and it needs to be stopped. So, hopefully, the courage will abound eventually in the Senate and we will get that vote. And therefore, people with standing could go to court and stop the flood of millions of dollars to Iran, which has already said that with the billions of dollars, $100 billion to $150 billion in the first year this administration is going to make available, they are going to commit so much more to terrorism than they ever had. Then we get this story just a few days ago from the Washington Free Beacon entitled, Iran Shows Off Third Underground Missile Site. It says: ``Iran's military recently publicized a third underground missile facility and showed the launch of a new ballistic missile through the top of a mountain. ``It was the third time since October that Tehran showed off an extensive network of underground missile facilities. The new video, however, for the first time, shows a missile launch from one of the country's underground launch facilities. ``Disclosure of the new video comes as Iran this week conducted the third launch of a ballistic missile since January, when the nuclear deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear weapons development went into effect.'' And I would submit, that part of the story is inaccurate. It is being considered to have gone into effect, but it is a treaty that was never ratified by the U.S. Senate, and it is an ineffective treaty. But the Obama administration is choosing to act as if the Iranian agreement really is an effective treaty. Iran has shown they have no intention of following that agreement. They have violated it a number of times. And the only reason Iran would have the gall to go forward and say, Hey, look, we have got a third underground missile site, we are going to let you see a launch, we don't care that the world knows that we are violating this last agreement with Obama and Kerry and Wendy Sherman that helped give North Korea nuclear weapons in the Clinton administration, we don't care that they know because we have now seen that this administration will not stand up to us, they will let us push them around, they will even let us take their soldiers or their naval officers, their naval seamen captive, violate virtually every treaty on the treatment of prisoners, humiliate the American sailors, force them to lie on camera, and after all that is said and done, we will get the Secretary of State to come back and thank us. I mean, it is like from ``Animal House,'' Kevin Bacon being beaten saying, Thank you, sir, may I have another? Iran has figured out they are the senior pledges, and this administration will take a beating and keep asking, Thank you, sir, may I have another? And Iran is all that willing to give them another and another. The trouble is this isn't a comedy movie, this is real life. Christians and Jews are being targeted, persecuted, and killed in greater numbers than at any time in the history of the world. The Middle East is on fire, except Israel is a place of stability. But if this administration has its will, it will become a powder keg before long as well. Libya had become more stable. And after the United States went into Iraq, because Saddam Hussein continued to refuse to abide by the orders of the U.N. that were passed by huge majorities, requiring them to disclose what they had, he wouldn't comply, most everybody was-- including those who now say, I voted for it, I really wasn't for it-- but, at the time, people thought, look, this guy must have something to hide because he is certainly not letting us get in to see what weapons he has. Other reports indicate that they had been taken from Iraq and were no longer present. But either way, it scared Qadhafi enough that, as some of the Israeli leaders have told me, we were shocked when you provided the firepower, the planes, and the bombs that made it possible to eliminate Qadhafi because, yeah, he had blood on his hands before 2003, but after 2003, he helped you more in fighting terrorism than anybody but us, and you took him out, and look what happened as a result. {time} 1300 It turned Egypt upside down. There are problems in Albania, problems all over North Africa, problems for the Middle East and North Africa both, problems coming down now of radical Islamists in Nigeria and other, more central African countries. They have paid a heavy price for the improper leadership of this administration here in the United States. It is just tragic how many have lost their lives already. Then we hear reports that in Nigeria--and I heard it when I was in Nigeria and was trying to help the Nigerian families whose daughters had been abducted--that this administration, behind the scenes, was saying: Look, we will help you with Boko Haram, with the terrorism-- although they don't like to use that word--with the radical extremism that is occurring in Nigeria. If you will change your laws, violate your religious beliefs, allow same-sex marriage, and pay for abortion, then we will help you. As one Nigerian Catholic bishop said: Our religious beliefs are not for sale, not to the U.S. President, not to anybody. I have an article that goes on about the situation with Iran. This is also from May 12: ``Kerry's Peculiar Message About Iran for European Banks.'' It reads: ``U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Thursday in London with a group of European financial institutions for a discussion about `Iranian banking matters.' The meeting, which followed repeated complaints by Iranian officials that they aren't getting the benefit of the bargain under the nuclear deal, was an effort by the State Department to persuade major non-U.S. banks that doing Iran-related business is not only permitted following the relaxation of Iran sanctions, but is actually encouraged. ``The irony will not be lost on these financial institutions. Most of them were similarly gathered almost 10 years ago by U.S. Treasury Henry Paulson to discuss Iranian banking matters, but that discussion focused on protecting the integrity of the global financial system against the risk posed by Iran. ``In the decade that followed, the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, as well as the U.K. and other governments, the European Union, and the United Nations, all imposed extensive sanctions targeting Iran's illicit and deceptive conduct. Banks were briefed extensively and repeatedly by the U.S. Treasury Department on the details of Iran's conduct. The Financial Action Task Force, the global standard-setting body for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, warned about the financial crime risks posed by Iran as a jurisdiction. The result: Iran became a financial pariah. ``No one has claimed that Iran has ceased to engage in much of the same conduct for which it was sanctioned, including actively supporting terrorism and building and testing ballistic missiles; but now Washington is pushing non-U.S. banks to do what is still illegal for American banks to do. ``This is a very odd position for the U.S. Government to be taking.'' It is shocking that this administration continues to be complicit with the largest supporter of terrorism in the world. How many lives will be lost because of this complicity? There was a time when America would not tolerate the kind of treatment of Americans that occurred to our seamen when they were taken captive. Not only did we not come to their defense, we praised Iran and thanked them for being so gracious for the manner in which they abused our sailors. This article goes on. It reads: ``On the one hand, Washington is continuing to prohibit American banks and companies from doing Iran-related business. In February, the FATF''--that is the Financial Action Task [[Page H2874]] Force--``reaffirmed its prior concerns about the 'serious threat' Iran poses to the international financial system, urging countries to apply effective countermeasures. The U.S. Treasury Department's designation of Iran, including its central bank and financial institutions, as a primary money laundering concern also still stands. As part of that designation, Treasury determined that `the international financial system is increasingly vulnerable to the risk that otherwise responsible financial institutions will, unwittingly, participate in Iran's illicit activities.' ``On the other hand, Mr. Kerry wants non-U.S. banks to do business with Iran without a U.S. repudiation of its prior statements about the associated financial crime risks. There are no assurances as to how such activity would subsequently be viewed by U.S. regulatory and law enforcement authorities, which might seek to take enforcement action against banks that enter the Iranian market and run afoul of complicated U.S. restrictions. The State Department neither controls nor plays any meaningful role in the enforcement decisions of these authorities. ``Washington has warned repeatedly that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps controls broad swaths of the Iranian economy. The IRGC remains sanctioned by both the United States and the European Union because of the central role it plays in Iran's illicit conduct. When the U.S., EU, and U.N. removed sanctions from several hundred Iranian banks and companies, there were no assurances that the conduct of those banks and companies had changed. ``This will present a challenge for European banks. HSBC is endeavoring to implement consistent and high standards across its global operations, designed to combat financial crime and prevent abuse by illicit actors. We have more work to do, but achieving that objective is one of our highest priorities. This approach is rightly expected by our regulators, including in the U.K. and the U.S. ``Our decisions will be driven by the financial crime risks and the underlying conduct. For these reasons, HSBC has no intention of doing any new business involving Iran. Governments can lift sanctions, but the private sector is still responsible for managing its own risk and, no doubt, will be held accountable if it falls short.'' That was from May 12, and it appears to be somebody who certainly knows the banking business. I would like to comment a bit about, again, our illegal immigration problems and our porous borders because the administration continues to act as if all is well--all is well--when it is not well. An article from May 19: ``Previously Deported Illegal Alien Allegedly Killed Prom Teen.'' ``The man that Houston police say was driving drunk and evading arrest when he crashed into a car, killing a young woman on her way home from the prom, is listed by Federal officials as a previously deported illegal alien.'' ``Edin Palacios-Rodas, a 27-year-old previously deported illegal alien from Guatemala, has now had an immigration detainer placed on him after being processed into the Harris County Jail on one count of felony murder and one count of felony evading resulting in death and serious bodily injury.'' It is still going on. With that going on, this administration continues to push for and has allies in Congress pushing for what they are calling sentencing reform when, actually, it won't be reform as much as it will be rather devastating. The pendulum on criminal justice swings back and forth. Most history shows that it has always been and probably will always be, whether a totalitarian government or a democratic republic such as ours. My friend in the Senate, Senator Jeff Sessions, has an article, again, from May 19 that reads: ``Senator Jeff Sessions warns that Congress must be careful to ensure the sentencing reductions bills pending before Congress did not boost already rising crime rates and `sign death warrants' for innocent victims.'' ``The Sentencing Reform and Correction Act, which the Alabama Republican opposes, hews to Obama's anti-law enforcement agenda and could cost an enormous human toll, Senator Sessions said. `Frankly, this is Obama's policy and the Attorney General who he's appointed, Loretta Lynch's policy, and Eric Holder's before her, to basically cut people's sentences that have been lawfully imposed throughout this country, and it's impacting public safety and will continue to do so in the future.' ``The Senator also highlighted many high-profile cop killings as the Obama administration makes police work more difficult. ``He said, `In the last year, we've lost 123 police officers, 35 in the first 4 months of 2016. Violent crimes and murders have increased across the country at alarming rates. Let me just share with my colleagues some of the things we're seeing in violent crime. Recently, the Major Cities Chiefs of Police Association, a long-established group, called an emergency meeting to deal with the numbers I'm going to share with you today.' ``The numbers I will quote represent the percentage increase in total murders in the first quarter of this year, 2016, over the first quarter . . . of 2015. Las Vegas: 82 percent increase.'' This is the murder increase. ``Dallas, Texas: 73 percent increase. Chicago: 70 percent. Jacksonville, Florida: 67 percent. Newark, New Jersey: 60 percent increase. Miami-Dade: 38 percent. Los Angeles: 33 percent.'' And on and on. ``These are substantial increases in crime. According to FBI statistics released just this year, the number of violent crimes committed across the country was up in the first half of 2015 compared with the same period of 2014.'' So, actually, we are going up and up, and the percentage increase in these cities of 82 percent, 73 percent, and a 70 percent increase is even more dramatic than that when you go back 2 years. Sessions also quoted FBI Director James Comey's concerns about the rising tide of crime. `` `I was very worried about it last fall, and I am, in many ways, more worried because the numbers are not only going up, they're continuing to go up in most of those cities faster than they were going up last year. Something is happening. I don't know what the answer is, but, holy cow, do we have a problem.''' Yes, we do have a problem. One of the answers is mentioned in this article, again, from May 19, entitled: ``Obama doesn't think rapists, armed robbers, drug dealers are criminals.'' I think I found the euphemism of the year. ``According to Team Obama, criminals should now be declared `justice- involved individuals.' ``The neo-Orwellianism comes to us from the bizarre flurry of last- minute dictates, regulations, and bone-chilling threats, collectively known to fanboys as Obama's Gorgeous Good-bye. ``In another of those smiley faced but deeply sinister `dear colleague' letters sent to universities and colleges this week, Obama's Education Secretary, John King, discouraged colleges from asking applicants whether they were convicted criminals.'' {time} 1315 It used to be a matter of common sense. Most Americans wanted to know. Especially in dormitories that have now become co-ed, where you have men and women living in and with and around each other, it was considered valuable information to know if your daughter was going to be living in, around, or with a convicted rapist. That was thought to be good information, but apparently that is no longer considered by this administration as good information. People all across America have shown an interest in knowing whether there are child molesters in their neighborhood where their children are growing up and children are playing around the area. They want to know if their child is at risk because they know there is a significant recidivism rate, particularly among child molesters. Yet, this administration says it is time to stop calling criminals criminals. Again, that is in keeping with the unwillingness to call radical Islamist, as the Muslim leader of Egypt, our friend, President el-Sisi, calls it--I mean, it is radical Islamists. He has had the courage to tell imams themselves that we have to get control again of Islam and wrestle it back away from the radical Islamists. [[Page H2875]] As my friend, Carolyn Glick, pointed out in The Jerusalem Post, by this administration's refusal to call radical Islam radical Islam, it betrays our allies who are Muslim--like President el-Sisi in Egypt--who are wanting Muslims to stand up and say that these Islamists should not be allowed to represent our religion because they know that they do. When you have a man with multiple degrees in Islamic studies saying that, yes, radical Islam is the ultimate Islam and, on the other hand, you have a President who did go to school in Indonesia in Muslim schools and elementary school but does not have any degrees in Islamic studies, like the world expert in Islamic studies, al-Qaradawi, well, one is President of the United States with no degrees in Islamic studies, and he says it is not Islam. But a man who has studied Islam his whole life and has multiple degrees, including a Ph.D., says not only is it Islam, as the head of ISIS as he is, this is Islam the way it should be. We should be giving assistance to our allies, giving them cover by not going on with this facade where this administration refuses to call radical Islam radical Islam. They call radical Islamic terrorism exactly what it is. They are not helping our friends around the world that are trying to stand up and do the right thing. You could go back to Libya, the attack of Benghazi. We now know from what has been gathered from emails and information that Secretary Clinton basically told the President of Libya: We know that this Benghazi attack was not on a video, in essence, and that it was a planned attack. She told her daughter. Yet, she went out, as did Susan Rice, representing this administration and told us all, oh, it was all about the video; telling victims families that we are going to get the guy who did the video. Victims families from Benghazi have told me personally, when Secretary Clinton said we are going to get the guys that did the videos, which she now says she didn't say--how tragic is that? So basically calling these victims' families liars. But the families say, when she said we will get the guy that did the video, they were infuriated. They said: We didn't care about the guy that did some video. We wanted our government to get the guys that killed our loved one, and that was not the message. You have to understand that there were a lot of things to do, there were promises to keep, and miles to go before they slept. But we don't know if they just went to bed and slept. When they found out the personal ambassador of the Secretary of State was missing, Clinton and President Obama, did they just go to bed? They won't tell us. We know President Obama had a very important engagement the next day. He had to fly out early to Las Vegas for a big campaign speech. We know. We understand. Hey, that was more pressing. We got that. We understand. To him, that was more pressing. What do you do? Do you go to sleep when you get word that your personal ambassador is missing? For the first time since 1979, an ambassador ends up being killed. He wasn't given adequate protection. Now, we are hearing more and more reports from people that the assets were there to go help. They could have saved at least two, maybe more of the four, but they were not allowed go and save the American heroes. Well, there is an article from Conservative Review entitled ``Busted: The 10 Most Dangerous Myths About Criminal Justice Reform'' that is being pushed especially by this administration. And we do have some colleagues here in the House and Senate that are as well. ``Myth number one: The prison population keeps growing, even though crime is declining.'' ``Fact: The D.C. intelligentsia argues our criminal justice system is in dire need of reform. But ask anyone outside the beltway, and they'll give you a different definition of `broken.' Many Americans would agree that current laws are too lenient on criminals and disregard the victim all too often. It was the tough reforms put into place during the Reagan years and in the '90s that produced the sharpest decline in violent crime on record. Those reforms, coupled with more aggressive policing, led to the only positive social trend in public policy in recent memory. That trend is now being reversed precisely as incarceration rates decline and Obama and his allies ratchet up the war against law enforcement. While correlation doesn't necessarily prove causation, the correlation is indeed striking and in conjunction with the defanging of local police departments, the release of tens of thousands of Federal prisoners can only result in exacerbating this negative trajectory.'' From the information that the FBI provided to Senator Sessions, we know about maybe less than 1 percent of Federal inmates in Federal prison are there for possession of a controlled substance; that most are there for more. Ninety-nine percent or so are there for more than that. But those that have been involved in the criminal justice system, both in the State side, as I was, and on the Federal side--I mean, we work with each other. And we know the Federal Government never had interest, that I ever saw, in simple possession cases. Where the Federal Government had interest is if a real bad guy--maybe he had been involved in a shooting, a killing, a robbing, a possession--but they wanted him to turn on his boss so they could get the bigger fish. They had to offer something to get him to turn, and they would offer--I have seen it many times--okay, we can't have a plea agreement where we set a certain sentence, as they do in State court, but what we can do is agree to drop all the charges, except this one possession. So the sentence is not that great. Whatever the judge does won't be that great. It won't have the weapons charge in there, even though he used a weapon and engaged in violent activity, if he will help us get Mr. Big. That happens. I have seen it happened. Back in the early '80s, when I was court appointed in Federal court, I had approaches like that with regard to my clients: What can you help us with, and here are the charges we are willing to drop, even though we know we can prove them. Yet, this administration acts like that never happens and that, obviously, all these people in prison because of drug charges are really nonviolent. That is garbage. That is why the crime rate keeps going up as this administration forces the release of more and more people. This article points out another myth: ``There are millions of people incarcerated in American prisons for no good reason.'' ``Fact: While there are approximately 1.5 million people incarcerated in American jails, prisons, and other institutions, only 195,900 are Federal inmates (a 10-year low). And only 159,000 in the Federal system are housed in actual prisons. The rest are in privately managed facilities, home confinement, short-term detention, long-term boarders, residential reentry centers, pretrial/presentence holding, et cetera. At least 25 percent of the Federal prison population is comprised of illegal aliens and possibly more who are noncitizens. We should save money by releasing those criminals and deporting them.'' What good does it do to deport somebody now when the border is so wide open? ``Myth number 3: Incarceration costs so much money and criminal justice reform will save billions.'' Well, without reading through the whole article, I can tell you that is garbage as well. Myth number 4: ``This bill will only release low level, nonviolent drug offenders.'' As I pointed out, that is simply not the case. It is a good article. Myth number 5: ``We have a big government culture of overcriminalization that threatens liberty.'' Well, the biggest problem of overcriminalization is when Congress has passed a law that says you can go to prison for violating any of the regulations regarding this subject, and then bureaucrats in some cubicle somewhere put some regulations in place under this administration--sometimes 80,000 pages of new regulations a year--and people, as the Heritage Foundation has said before in one of their books, are probably all violating three or four Federal laws a day. One other thing I wanted to touch on because it has been debated and a lot of [[Page H2876]] allegations made, people are trying to assert that Republicans somehow are supportive of the old ways of slavery. Mr. Speaker, I just want to read from the Democratic Party Platform of 1856. This is a part of the platform. This is the belief of the Democratic Party, the national party: ``That Congress has no power under the Constitution, to interfere with or control the domestic institutions of the several States, and that such States are the sole and proper judges of everything appertaining to their own affairs, not prohibited by the Constitution; that all efforts of the abolitionists''--that is those who wanted to end slavery--``or others, made to induce Congress to interfere with questions of slavery . . . are calculated to lead to the most alarming and dangerous consequences; and that all such efforts''--talking about the end of slavery--``have an inevitable tendency to diminish the happiness of the people and endanger the stability and permanency of the Union, and ought not to be countenanced by any friend of our political institutions.'' The Democratic Party Platform of 1856 also declares that ``new States'' to the Union should be admitted ``with or without domestic slavery, as the State may elect.'' The Platform that year also says that ``we recognize the right of the people of all the Territories . . . to form a Constitution, with or without domestic slavery.'' {time} 1330 The platform of 1860 of the national Democratic Party, in seeking to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act, states: ``The enactments of the State legislatures to defeat the faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Act are hostile in character, subversive of the Constitution, and revolutionary in their effect.'' The 14th Amendment, giving full citizenship to freed slaves, passed in 1868 with 94 percent Republican support and zero percent Democratic support in Congress. The 15th Amendment, giving freed slaves the right to vote, passed in 1870 with 100 percent Republican support and zero percent Democratic support in Congress. The Constitution of 1902 in the State of Virginia disenfranchised about 90 percent of the Black men who still voted at the beginning of the 20th century and nearly half of the White men. The number of eligible African American voters fell from about 147,000 in 1901 to about 10,000 by 1905. The measure was supported almost entirely by Virginia State Democrats. In 1924, the Democratic National Convention convened in New York at Madison Square Garden. The convention is commonly known as the Klanbake due to the overwhelming influence of the Ku Klux Klan in the party. In 1964, the Democratic Party led a 75-day filibuster against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Leading the Democrats in their opposition to civil rights for African Americans was a member of the Democratic Party, Senator Robert Byrd from West Virginia, who was known to be a recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan. Senator Byrd spoke directly about the Civil Rights Act in a 14-hour filibuster, proclaiming: ``Men are not equal today, and they were not created equal in 1776, when the Declaration of Independence was written. Men and races of men differ in appearance, ways, physical power, mental capacity, creativity, and vision.'' The Democratic Party identified itself as the ``White man's party'' and demonized the Republican Party as being dominated by African Americans. So it is interesting to hear these rewritten parts of our history. When you know the hearts and minds of the people on the Republican side of the aisle, you find out there is nobody who wants slavery. We wish that slavery that held this Nation back--because as Daniel Webster used to preach and John Quincy Adams used to preach, how was a good God going to keep blessing America when we were treating brothers and sisters in Christ this way, putting them in chains and bondage? America was harmed. It was devastating to African American lives to be placed in slavery--the degradation, the humiliation. I am grateful to be part of the party that stood up and made the change. But more than the Republican Party, the Judeo-Christian beliefs, especially in the 1700s after the Great Awakening, the First Great Awakening in America, revival in America where people turned to God, became Christians, they understood travesties better by understanding the Bible. They stood up, and they demanded equal rights for people, and it led to a revolution. In the 1800s, there was a lot of debauchery, but during the Second Great Awakening, churches were really the core behind the abolitionist movement. We should never be putting brothers and sisters in chains. That is an abomination. It held America back. It helped greatly prevent America from reaching the heights that it would once slavery was gone. But then even after slavery was gone, as a result of the great Republican father of our party, Abraham Lincoln, as he is sometimes referred to, people were not treated equally. As I just read, even in Virginia, this great State of Virginia, Democrats were determined to prevent African Americans from voting, and they were successful in large degree. Mr. Speaker, I think a good way to finish today is to go back to the final argument. We have the entire final argument from John Quincy Adams. He was elected President in 1824. He was defeated by Andrew Jackson in 1828. But in 1830 he did an incredible thing that no one has ever done since. After being President, he ran for Congress, for the House of Representatives. He didn't even run for Senate. He ran for the House of Representatives. He believed God was calling him. As William Wilberforce believed God had called him to bring an end to slavery in Great Britain, Adams believed God was calling him back into government after being defeated as President, that he would lower himself to run for the House of Representatives. He got elected in 1830. Speech after speech was against slavery. How can we expect God to bless America when we are treating brothers and sisters with chains and bondage? Sermons were so powerful that those sermons given against slavery, as he filed bills to end slavery, to free specific slaves over and over, those sermons he preached on the floor of the House right down the hall had a powerful impact on a homely-looking guy with an unpleasant sounding voice named Abraham Lincoln. He overlapped briefly before the massive stroke that took John Quincy Adams out. Adams knew when he died back in the Speaker's suite that he had not done what he thought God had called him to do--end slavery. It was 1848. But we now know, and Lincoln knew and said as much, as Steve Mansfield was telling me. He wrote a great book on Lincoln's struggle with God. He knew that those speeches on the House floor down the hall, they didn't end slavery, but they materially changed the attitude and affected that man named Abraham Lincoln that, 13 years after Adams would die, he would see to slavery's end. At the end of his argument, he was afraid he had not prevailed on behalf of Africans who were taken as captives by another African tribe, sold into slavery, and taken to the African coast. They were put on a ship and taken to the Caribbean, where they were put on a smaller ship called the Amistad. ``Amistad'' is a great movie. Longview, Texas, native Matthew McConaughey plays the trial lawyer representing the Africans. Their position was: We are not anybody's property. When the Africans took over the ship, landed accidentally in America, the Spanish said: These people are our property, and this ship is ours. Let us go. The Africans' version: Hey, we are not anybody's property. We want to go home. That case was argued downstairs in the old Supreme Court Chamber. Adams knew if he didn't do an adequate job, those Africans would leave in chains, their children would wear chains; and he was scared to death that he would not have been up to the job, and, as a result, there would be more suffering. We have his exact argument. He finished like this. This is after he had been President. He said: ``Little did I imagine that I should ever again be required to claim the right of appearing in the capacity of an officer of this Court; yet such has been the dictate of my destiny--and I [[Page H2877]] appear again to plead the cause of justice, and now of liberty and life, in behalf of many of my fellow men, before that same Court, which in a former age I had addressed in support of rights of property I stand again, I trust for the last time, before the same Court.'' He goes on to say: ``I stand before the same Court, but not before the same judges--nor aided by the same associates--nor resisted by the same opponents. As I cast my eyes--`` he stood looking at the judges-- ``along those seats of honor and of public trust, now occupied by you, they seek in vain for one of those honored and honorable persons whose indulgence listened then to my voice. Marshall--Cushing--Chase-- Washington--Johnson--Livingston--Todd--where are they? Where is that eloquent statesman and learned lawyer who was my associate counsel in the management of that cause, Robert Goodloe Harper? Where is that brilliant luminary, so long the pride of Maryland and of the American bar, then my opposing counsel, Luther Martin? Where is the excellent clerk of that day, whose name has been inscribed on the shores of Africa, as a monument of his abhorrence of the African slave-trade, Elias B. Caldwell? Where is the marshal--where are the criers of the Court? Alas. Where is one of the very judges of the Court, arbiters of life and death, before whom I commenced this anxious argument, even now prematurely closed? Where are they all? Gone. Gone. All gone--gone from the services which, in their day and generation, they faithfully rendered to their country. From the excellent characters which they sustained in life, so far as I have had the means of knowing, I humbly hope, and fondly trust, that they have gone to receive the rewards of blessedness on high. In taking, then, my final leave of this Bar, and of this honorable Court, I can only . . . ``a fervent petition to Heaven, that every member of it may go to his final account with as little of earthly frailty to answer for as those illustrious dead, and that you may, every one''--talking to the judges--``after the close of a long and virtuous career in this world, be received at the portals of the next with the approving sentence--`Well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' '' We should all hope as such. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [House] [Pages H2871-H2877] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is amazing sometimes the way, in the heat of dispute, argument--sometimes [[Page H2872]] any of us can have it happen to us--people don't think clearly. I have been here for nearly 11\1/2\ years in Congress. It is a tremendous honor to get to be the servant for the people of east Texas. But in that 11\1/2\ years, 4 of them the Democrats were in the majority, and my friend from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) was the majority leader during those 4 years, and the rules never changed with regard to how the electronic voting worked. For the last 11\1/2\ years, it has always been the same. And that is, we could take our voting card--and it has a little computer chip in it. It doesn't matter which we way put our card in the box. If the blue light on the box is lit, it means that box is open for voting. Most every other row has a voting box on the back. We take our card, and we put it in the slot whichever way. It recognizes the one-of-a-kind computer chip that belongs to that 1 of 435 Members, and then you can hit the green button for ``yea,'' the red button the ``nay,'' the yellow button for ``present.'' The blue light is on there. It is next in order on the box, but it can't be pushed. It just lets you know the box is open for voting. Toward the end of a vote, particularly a 15-minute vote, the Speaker will not have gaveled the vote dead, but oftentimes the box goes dead right before the gavel comes down. Even to that point, you can still change your vote, but it is just when the blue light goes out, you can't do it at the box. You have to come down to the well. What I have noticed every year for the last 11\1/2\ years that I have been here, if we are voting on a 15-minute vote--and all of us have probably done it at one time or another--if you need to change your vote, maybe you looked up and, for example, sometimes one person has multiple amendments, and you see their name and it is their amendment, and you say, ``Oh, I was not going to vote for that,'' and you vote ``no'' and you need to change your vote to ``yes,'' you can still change your vote at the box. On a 15-minute vote, once you get past 5 minutes, you normally have to come down to the well and get a green card for ``yea,'' a red card for ``nay,'' or a yellow card for ``present'' or ``abstaining'' and change your vote that way. But on a 5-minute vote or a 2-minute vote, if you need to change your vote, you didn't understand the significance, it constantly happens that people change their vote. {time} 1245 But to change their vote, if you have your voting card, you have been able to change it at the box on a 5-minute vote or a 2-minute vote. Every now and then, before the gavel comes down, the blue light will go off on the box, so you can no longer change your vote or vote at that box. That is when you hear someone yelling, ``One more, one more,'' and they come rushing down the aisle to get the vote in before the gavel comes down. Now, in 11\1/2\ years, only one time has there been a massive and gross violation of the rules the way we have followed them in bringing a vote to a conclusion. I can understand my friend from Maryland being sensitive, because this happened on his watch as majority leader. But Republicans were in the minority, and yet there was a vote. I don't even remember if it was a bill or an amendment. I think it was an amendment. But the Republicans voting against the amendment had enough Democrats voting with us that we were bringing down a Democratic amendment or bill, and it was left open for enough time that anybody that wanted to change could have changed. When the Democrat in the chair felt that enough time had passed, no other changes were being made, and the measure being voted on had failed, then the gavel came down. The rule has always been that when the gavel comes down, there can be no further changing of the vote. Perhaps, the majority leader, at that time Hoyer, had forgotten. But that was the time they violated their own rules. A subsequent investigation confirmed that. They violated the rules and allowed someone whose arm they were twisting to vote after the gavel came down to change the vote, change the outcome of the vote. That didn't happen here today. And the vote wasn't held open very long at all after the end of the time running out. Sometimes, whether it is Democrats or Republicans in the majority, it runs to zero. But if, in the opinion of the Chair or the Speaker, there is somebody wanting to change their vote or somebody that is making a good faith effort to get here to vote, they will leave the vote open. Sometimes, like when Speaker Pelosi was meeting with President Obama at the White House and wasn't getting back in time, or Majority Leader Hoyer, and they weren't getting back in time, well, that vote would be held open to give them time well beyond the zero, zero, zero, so they could cast that vote. Nobody objected because we knew they were making a good faith effort to get here. I understand sometimes we forget things that we have been doing for a number of years. And especially in the heat of debate and a verbal battle here on the floor, people can forget what they have been doing for many, many years. But that has been the way the voting and the rules on voting have worked and been interpreted for many years. So I was greatly surprised to hear the former majority leader challenging on the basis that people didn't come into the well to change their vote on either a 5-minute or a 2-minute vote. Well, they have always been able to change their vote. The voting boxes were open. Anyway, we all have those mental lapses where we forget things that we have been doing for years. I mean, it just happens, and especially here on the floor. There is nothing to be taken from former Majority Leader Hoyer forgetting how the rules were when he was majority leader and forgetting how they have been all these years since, so no hard feelings. He just had a mental lapse and forgot how the rules have been ever since he has been here the entire time. There has been a great deal of to-do and a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth about what I would term the ``Iranian crisis'' because it truly is a crisis that this administration has enabled Iran to go ahead and develop nuclear weapons to continue down that path. Even though they are supposed to be prohibited, they continued to develop missiles that eventually will be capable of delivering nuclear weapons onto the United States. They have got missiles to deliver them on to Israel right now. But as Prime Minister Netanyahu so ably has pointed out from this very rostrum right up here, those missiles they are developing now are not for Israel. They can already reach Israel. Those are for the Great Satan. So it was deeply troubling to hear the confessions and admissions of the White House adviser consultant mouthpiece, Ben Rhodes, reveal that the administration--and I am being careful not to use any specific names. I am addressing generally the administration--that the administration had to lie to the American people and had to lie to the House and Senate about how evil Iran really was and had to talk about how moderate they were when, actually, the fact is, apparently, under the so-called moderate President Rouhani, there have been more people put to death than even under the former President Ahmadinejad. This man is no moderate. Though the American people were fed lies about the negotiations, they were having to negotiate, either directly or indirectly, with the Ayatollah Khamenei. They don't make big decisions like a nuclear weapons deal, unless the religious leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, actually agreed, just like his predecessor, the Ayatollah Khomeini. So just like with the revelations about ObamaCare, now that we have had someone working behind the scenes with the administration who revealed, yes, the reason ObamaCare passed was because people are such fools, they were able to fool them into voting for a bill that was really not anything like what was being represented. And yet along comes Ben Rhodes, and he admits they did the same thing on ObamaCare that they did on the Iranian treaty. Now, I understand the administration has never called it a treaty, and there are people in the Senate who have not had the courage to call it a treaty, but it is a treaty. You can't change a nuclear proliferation treaty [[Page H2873]] with an executive agreement or an executive order. It can't be done. It has to be done with another treaty. So, clearly, there are a number of things that made clear that the Iranian deal was a treaty. It should have been brought to the floor of the Senate. It still should be. It is time. You can do it any time this year. You could do it with 51 votes of the Senate setting aside cloture and saying, the Iranian treaty is a treaty, it is going to allow Iran to have nuclear weapons that will allow them to devastate both the Little Satan, in their opinion Israel, and the Great Satan, the United States, and it needs to be stopped. So, hopefully, the courage will abound eventually in the Senate and we will get that vote. And therefore, people with standing could go to court and stop the flood of millions of dollars to Iran, which has already said that with the billions of dollars, $100 billion to $150 billion in the first year this administration is going to make available, they are going to commit so much more to terrorism than they ever had. Then we get this story just a few days ago from the Washington Free Beacon entitled, Iran Shows Off Third Underground Missile Site. It says: ``Iran's military recently publicized a third underground missile facility and showed the launch of a new ballistic missile through the top of a mountain. ``It was the third time since October that Tehran showed off an extensive network of underground missile facilities. The new video, however, for the first time, shows a missile launch from one of the country's underground launch facilities. ``Disclosure of the new video comes as Iran this week conducted the third launch of a ballistic missile since January, when the nuclear deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear weapons development went into effect.'' And I would submit, that part of the story is inaccurate. It is being considered to have gone into effect, but it is a treaty that was never ratified by the U.S. Senate, and it is an ineffective treaty. But the Obama administration is choosing to act as if the Iranian agreement really is an effective treaty. Iran has shown they have no intention of following that agreement. They have violated it a number of times. And the only reason Iran would have the gall to go forward and say, Hey, look, we have got a third underground missile site, we are going to let you see a launch, we don't care that the world knows that we are violating this last agreement with Obama and Kerry and Wendy Sherman that helped give North Korea nuclear weapons in the Clinton administration, we don't care that they know because we have now seen that this administration will not stand up to us, they will let us push them around, they will even let us take their soldiers or their naval officers, their naval seamen captive, violate virtually every treaty on the treatment of prisoners, humiliate the American sailors, force them to lie on camera, and after all that is said and done, we will get the Secretary of State to come back and thank us. I mean, it is like from ``Animal House,'' Kevin Bacon being beaten saying, Thank you, sir, may I have another? Iran has figured out they are the senior pledges, and this administration will take a beating and keep asking, Thank you, sir, may I have another? And Iran is all that willing to give them another and another. The trouble is this isn't a comedy movie, this is real life. Christians and Jews are being targeted, persecuted, and killed in greater numbers than at any time in the history of the world. The Middle East is on fire, except Israel is a place of stability. But if this administration has its will, it will become a powder keg before long as well. Libya had become more stable. And after the United States went into Iraq, because Saddam Hussein continued to refuse to abide by the orders of the U.N. that were passed by huge majorities, requiring them to disclose what they had, he wouldn't comply, most everybody was-- including those who now say, I voted for it, I really wasn't for it-- but, at the time, people thought, look, this guy must have something to hide because he is certainly not letting us get in to see what weapons he has. Other reports indicate that they had been taken from Iraq and were no longer present. But either way, it scared Qadhafi enough that, as some of the Israeli leaders have told me, we were shocked when you provided the firepower, the planes, and the bombs that made it possible to eliminate Qadhafi because, yeah, he had blood on his hands before 2003, but after 2003, he helped you more in fighting terrorism than anybody but us, and you took him out, and look what happened as a result. {time} 1300 It turned Egypt upside down. There are problems in Albania, problems all over North Africa, problems for the Middle East and North Africa both, problems coming down now of radical Islamists in Nigeria and other, more central African countries. They have paid a heavy price for the improper leadership of this administration here in the United States. It is just tragic how many have lost their lives already. Then we hear reports that in Nigeria--and I heard it when I was in Nigeria and was trying to help the Nigerian families whose daughters had been abducted--that this administration, behind the scenes, was saying: Look, we will help you with Boko Haram, with the terrorism-- although they don't like to use that word--with the radical extremism that is occurring in Nigeria. If you will change your laws, violate your religious beliefs, allow same-sex marriage, and pay for abortion, then we will help you. As one Nigerian Catholic bishop said: Our religious beliefs are not for sale, not to the U.S. President, not to anybody. I have an article that goes on about the situation with Iran. This is also from May 12: ``Kerry's Peculiar Message About Iran for European Banks.'' It reads: ``U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Thursday in London with a group of European financial institutions for a discussion about `Iranian banking matters.' The meeting, which followed repeated complaints by Iranian officials that they aren't getting the benefit of the bargain under the nuclear deal, was an effort by the State Department to persuade major non-U.S. banks that doing Iran-related business is not only permitted following the relaxation of Iran sanctions, but is actually encouraged. ``The irony will not be lost on these financial institutions. Most of them were similarly gathered almost 10 years ago by U.S. Treasury Henry Paulson to discuss Iranian banking matters, but that discussion focused on protecting the integrity of the global financial system against the risk posed by Iran. ``In the decade that followed, the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, as well as the U.K. and other governments, the European Union, and the United Nations, all imposed extensive sanctions targeting Iran's illicit and deceptive conduct. Banks were briefed extensively and repeatedly by the U.S. Treasury Department on the details of Iran's conduct. The Financial Action Task Force, the global standard-setting body for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, warned about the financial crime risks posed by Iran as a jurisdiction. The result: Iran became a financial pariah. ``No one has claimed that Iran has ceased to engage in much of the same conduct for which it was sanctioned, including actively supporting terrorism and building and testing ballistic missiles; but now Washington is pushing non-U.S. banks to do what is still illegal for American banks to do. ``This is a very odd position for the U.S. Government to be taking.'' It is shocking that this administration continues to be complicit with the largest supporter of terrorism in the world. How many lives will be lost because of this complicity? There was a time when America would not tolerate the kind of treatment of Americans that occurred to our seamen when they were taken captive. Not only did we not come to their defense, we praised Iran and thanked them for being so gracious for the manner in which they abused our sailors. This article goes on. It reads: ``On the one hand, Washington is continuing to prohibit American banks and companies from doing Iran-related business. In February, the FATF''--that is the Financial Action Task [[Page H2874]] Force--``reaffirmed its prior concerns about the 'serious threat' Iran poses to the international financial system, urging countries to apply effective countermeasures. The U.S. Treasury Department's designation of Iran, including its central bank and financial institutions, as a primary money laundering concern also still stands. As part of that designation, Treasury determined that `the international financial system is increasingly vulnerable to the risk that otherwise responsible financial institutions will, unwittingly, participate in Iran's illicit activities.' ``On the other hand, Mr. Kerry wants non-U.S. banks to do business with Iran without a U.S. repudiation of its prior statements about the associated financial crime risks. There are no assurances as to how such activity would subsequently be viewed by U.S. regulatory and law enforcement authorities, which might seek to take enforcement action against banks that enter the Iranian market and run afoul of complicated U.S. restrictions. The State Department neither controls nor plays any meaningful role in the enforcement decisions of these authorities. ``Washington has warned repeatedly that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps controls broad swaths of the Iranian economy. The IRGC remains sanctioned by both the United States and the European Union because of the central role it plays in Iran's illicit conduct. When the U.S., EU, and U.N. removed sanctions from several hundred Iranian banks and companies, there were no assurances that the conduct of those banks and companies had changed. ``This will present a challenge for European banks. HSBC is endeavoring to implement consistent and high standards across its global operations, designed to combat financial crime and prevent abuse by illicit actors. We have more work to do, but achieving that objective is one of our highest priorities. This approach is rightly expected by our regulators, including in the U.K. and the U.S. ``Our decisions will be driven by the financial crime risks and the underlying conduct. For these reasons, HSBC has no intention of doing any new business involving Iran. Governments can lift sanctions, but the private sector is still responsible for managing its own risk and, no doubt, will be held accountable if it falls short.'' That was from May 12, and it appears to be somebody who certainly knows the banking business. I would like to comment a bit about, again, our illegal immigration problems and our porous borders because the administration continues to act as if all is well--all is well--when it is not well. An article from May 19: ``Previously Deported Illegal Alien Allegedly Killed Prom Teen.'' ``The man that Houston police say was driving drunk and evading arrest when he crashed into a car, killing a young woman on her way home from the prom, is listed by Federal officials as a previously deported illegal alien.'' ``Edin Palacios-Rodas, a 27-year-old previously deported illegal alien from Guatemala, has now had an immigration detainer placed on him after being processed into the Harris County Jail on one count of felony murder and one count of felony evading resulting in death and serious bodily injury.'' It is still going on. With that going on, this administration continues to push for and has allies in Congress pushing for what they are calling sentencing reform when, actually, it won't be reform as much as it will be rather devastating. The pendulum on criminal justice swings back and forth. Most history shows that it has always been and probably will always be, whether a totalitarian government or a democratic republic such as ours. My friend in the Senate, Senator Jeff Sessions, has an article, again, from May 19 that reads: ``Senator Jeff Sessions warns that Congress must be careful to ensure the sentencing reductions bills pending before Congress did not boost already rising crime rates and `sign death warrants' for innocent victims.'' ``The Sentencing Reform and Correction Act, which the Alabama Republican opposes, hews to Obama's anti-law enforcement agenda and could cost an enormous human toll, Senator Sessions said. `Frankly, this is Obama's policy and the Attorney General who he's appointed, Loretta Lynch's policy, and Eric Holder's before her, to basically cut people's sentences that have been lawfully imposed throughout this country, and it's impacting public safety and will continue to do so in the future.' ``The Senator also highlighted many high-profile cop killings as the Obama administration makes police work more difficult. ``He said, `In the last year, we've lost 123 police officers, 35 in the first 4 months of 2016. Violent crimes and murders have increased across the country at alarming rates. Let me just share with my colleagues some of the things we're seeing in violent crime. Recently, the Major Cities Chiefs of Police Association, a long-established group, called an emergency meeting to deal with the numbers I'm going to share with you today.' ``The numbers I will quote represent the percentage increase in total murders in the first quarter of this year, 2016, over the first quarter . . . of 2015. Las Vegas: 82 percent increase.'' This is the murder increase. ``Dallas, Texas: 73 percent increase. Chicago: 70 percent. Jacksonville, Florida: 67 percent. Newark, New Jersey: 60 percent increase. Miami-Dade: 38 percent. Los Angeles: 33 percent.'' And on and on. ``These are substantial increases in crime. According to FBI statistics released just this year, the number of violent crimes committed across the country was up in the first half of 2015 compared with the same period of 2014.'' So, actually, we are going up and up, and the percentage increase in these cities of 82 percent, 73 percent, and a 70 percent increase is even more dramatic than that when you go back 2 years. Sessions also quoted FBI Director James Comey's concerns about the rising tide of crime. `` `I was very worried about it last fall, and I am, in many ways, more worried because the numbers are not only going up, they're continuing to go up in most of those cities faster than they were going up last year. Something is happening. I don't know what the answer is, but, holy cow, do we have a problem.''' Yes, we do have a problem. One of the answers is mentioned in this article, again, from May 19, entitled: ``Obama doesn't think rapists, armed robbers, drug dealers are criminals.'' I think I found the euphemism of the year. ``According to Team Obama, criminals should now be declared `justice- involved individuals.' ``The neo-Orwellianism comes to us from the bizarre flurry of last- minute dictates, regulations, and bone-chilling threats, collectively known to fanboys as Obama's Gorgeous Good-bye. ``In another of those smiley faced but deeply sinister `dear colleague' letters sent to universities and colleges this week, Obama's Education Secretary, John King, discouraged colleges from asking applicants whether they were convicted criminals.'' {time} 1315 It used to be a matter of common sense. Most Americans wanted to know. Especially in dormitories that have now become co-ed, where you have men and women living in and with and around each other, it was considered valuable information to know if your daughter was going to be living in, around, or with a convicted rapist. That was thought to be good information, but apparently that is no longer considered by this administration as good information. People all across America have shown an interest in knowing whether there are child molesters in their neighborhood where their children are growing up and children are playing around the area. They want to know if their child is at risk because they know there is a significant recidivism rate, particularly among child molesters. Yet, this administration says it is time to stop calling criminals criminals. Again, that is in keeping with the unwillingness to call radical Islamist, as the Muslim leader of Egypt, our friend, President el-Sisi, calls it--I mean, it is radical Islamists. He has had the courage to tell imams themselves that we have to get control again of Islam and wrestle it back away from the radical Islamists. [[Page H2875]] As my friend, Carolyn Glick, pointed out in The Jerusalem Post, by this administration's refusal to call radical Islam radical Islam, it betrays our allies who are Muslim--like President el-Sisi in Egypt--who are wanting Muslims to stand up and say that these Islamists should not be allowed to represent our religion because they know that they do. When you have a man with multiple degrees in Islamic studies saying that, yes, radical Islam is the ultimate Islam and, on the other hand, you have a President who did go to school in Indonesia in Muslim schools and elementary school but does not have any degrees in Islamic studies, like the world expert in Islamic studies, al-Qaradawi, well, one is President of the United States with no degrees in Islamic studies, and he says it is not Islam. But a man who has studied Islam his whole life and has multiple degrees, including a Ph.D., says not only is it Islam, as the head of ISIS as he is, this is Islam the way it should be. We should be giving assistance to our allies, giving them cover by not going on with this facade where this administration refuses to call radical Islam radical Islam. They call radical Islamic terrorism exactly what it is. They are not helping our friends around the world that are trying to stand up and do the right thing. You could go back to Libya, the attack of Benghazi. We now know from what has been gathered from emails and information that Secretary Clinton basically told the President of Libya: We know that this Benghazi attack was not on a video, in essence, and that it was a planned attack. She told her daughter. Yet, she went out, as did Susan Rice, representing this administration and told us all, oh, it was all about the video; telling victims families that we are going to get the guy who did the video. Victims families from Benghazi have told me personally, when Secretary Clinton said we are going to get the guys that did the videos, which she now says she didn't say--how tragic is that? So basically calling these victims' families liars. But the families say, when she said we will get the guy that did the video, they were infuriated. They said: We didn't care about the guy that did some video. We wanted our government to get the guys that killed our loved one, and that was not the message. You have to understand that there were a lot of things to do, there were promises to keep, and miles to go before they slept. But we don't know if they just went to bed and slept. When they found out the personal ambassador of the Secretary of State was missing, Clinton and President Obama, did they just go to bed? They won't tell us. We know President Obama had a very important engagement the next day. He had to fly out early to Las Vegas for a big campaign speech. We know. We understand. Hey, that was more pressing. We got that. We understand. To him, that was more pressing. What do you do? Do you go to sleep when you get word that your personal ambassador is missing? For the first time since 1979, an ambassador ends up being killed. He wasn't given adequate protection. Now, we are hearing more and more reports from people that the assets were there to go help. They could have saved at least two, maybe more of the four, but they were not allowed go and save the American heroes. Well, there is an article from Conservative Review entitled ``Busted: The 10 Most Dangerous Myths About Criminal Justice Reform'' that is being pushed especially by this administration. And we do have some colleagues here in the House and Senate that are as well. ``Myth number one: The prison population keeps growing, even though crime is declining.'' ``Fact: The D.C. intelligentsia argues our criminal justice system is in dire need of reform. But ask anyone outside the beltway, and they'll give you a different definition of `broken.' Many Americans would agree that current laws are too lenient on criminals and disregard the victim all too often. It was the tough reforms put into place during the Reagan years and in the '90s that produced the sharpest decline in violent crime on record. Those reforms, coupled with more aggressive policing, led to the only positive social trend in public policy in recent memory. That trend is now being reversed precisely as incarceration rates decline and Obama and his allies ratchet up the war against law enforcement. While correlation doesn't necessarily prove causation, the correlation is indeed striking and in conjunction with the defanging of local police departments, the release of tens of thousands of Federal prisoners can only result in exacerbating this negative trajectory.'' From the information that the FBI provided to Senator Sessions, we know about maybe less than 1 percent of Federal inmates in Federal prison are there for possession of a controlled substance; that most are there for more. Ninety-nine percent or so are there for more than that. But those that have been involved in the criminal justice system, both in the State side, as I was, and on the Federal side--I mean, we work with each other. And we know the Federal Government never had interest, that I ever saw, in simple possession cases. Where the Federal Government had interest is if a real bad guy--maybe he had been involved in a shooting, a killing, a robbing, a possession--but they wanted him to turn on his boss so they could get the bigger fish. They had to offer something to get him to turn, and they would offer--I have seen it many times--okay, we can't have a plea agreement where we set a certain sentence, as they do in State court, but what we can do is agree to drop all the charges, except this one possession. So the sentence is not that great. Whatever the judge does won't be that great. It won't have the weapons charge in there, even though he used a weapon and engaged in violent activity, if he will help us get Mr. Big. That happens. I have seen it happened. Back in the early '80s, when I was court appointed in Federal court, I had approaches like that with regard to my clients: What can you help us with, and here are the charges we are willing to drop, even though we know we can prove them. Yet, this administration acts like that never happens and that, obviously, all these people in prison because of drug charges are really nonviolent. That is garbage. That is why the crime rate keeps going up as this administration forces the release of more and more people. This article points out another myth: ``There are millions of people incarcerated in American prisons for no good reason.'' ``Fact: While there are approximately 1.5 million people incarcerated in American jails, prisons, and other institutions, only 195,900 are Federal inmates (a 10-year low). And only 159,000 in the Federal system are housed in actual prisons. The rest are in privately managed facilities, home confinement, short-term detention, long-term boarders, residential reentry centers, pretrial/presentence holding, et cetera. At least 25 percent of the Federal prison population is comprised of illegal aliens and possibly more who are noncitizens. We should save money by releasing those criminals and deporting them.'' What good does it do to deport somebody now when the border is so wide open? ``Myth number 3: Incarceration costs so much money and criminal justice reform will save billions.'' Well, without reading through the whole article, I can tell you that is garbage as well. Myth number 4: ``This bill will only release low level, nonviolent drug offenders.'' As I pointed out, that is simply not the case. It is a good article. Myth number 5: ``We have a big government culture of overcriminalization that threatens liberty.'' Well, the biggest problem of overcriminalization is when Congress has passed a law that says you can go to prison for violating any of the regulations regarding this subject, and then bureaucrats in some cubicle somewhere put some regulations in place under this administration--sometimes 80,000 pages of new regulations a year--and people, as the Heritage Foundation has said before in one of their books, are probably all violating three or four Federal laws a day. One other thing I wanted to touch on because it has been debated and a lot of [[Page H2876]] allegations made, people are trying to assert that Republicans somehow are supportive of the old ways of slavery. Mr. Speaker, I just want to read from the Democratic Party Platform of 1856. This is a part of the platform. This is the belief of the Democratic Party, the national party: ``That Congress has no power under the Constitution, to interfere with or control the domestic institutions of the several States, and that such States are the sole and proper judges of everything appertaining to their own affairs, not prohibited by the Constitution; that all efforts of the abolitionists''--that is those who wanted to end slavery--``or others, made to induce Congress to interfere with questions of slavery . . . are calculated to lead to the most alarming and dangerous consequences; and that all such efforts''--talking about the end of slavery--``have an inevitable tendency to diminish the happiness of the people and endanger the stability and permanency of the Union, and ought not to be countenanced by any friend of our political institutions.'' The Democratic Party Platform of 1856 also declares that ``new States'' to the Union should be admitted ``with or without domestic slavery, as the State may elect.'' The Platform that year also says that ``we recognize the right of the people of all the Territories . . . to form a Constitution, with or without domestic slavery.'' {time} 1330 The platform of 1860 of the national Democratic Party, in seeking to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act, states: ``The enactments of the State legislatures to defeat the faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Act are hostile in character, subversive of the Constitution, and revolutionary in their effect.'' The 14th Amendment, giving full citizenship to freed slaves, passed in 1868 with 94 percent Republican support and zero percent Democratic support in Congress. The 15th Amendment, giving freed slaves the right to vote, passed in 1870 with 100 percent Republican support and zero percent Democratic support in Congress. The Constitution of 1902 in the State of Virginia disenfranchised about 90 percent of the Black men who still voted at the beginning of the 20th century and nearly half of the White men. The number of eligible African American voters fell from about 147,000 in 1901 to about 10,000 by 1905. The measure was supported almost entirely by Virginia State Democrats. In 1924, the Democratic National Convention convened in New York at Madison Square Garden. The convention is commonly known as the Klanbake due to the overwhelming influence of the Ku Klux Klan in the party. In 1964, the Democratic Party led a 75-day filibuster against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Leading the Democrats in their opposition to civil rights for African Americans was a member of the Democratic Party, Senator Robert Byrd from West Virginia, who was known to be a recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan. Senator Byrd spoke directly about the Civil Rights Act in a 14-hour filibuster, proclaiming: ``Men are not equal today, and they were not created equal in 1776, when the Declaration of Independence was written. Men and races of men differ in appearance, ways, physical power, mental capacity, creativity, and vision.'' The Democratic Party identified itself as the ``White man's party'' and demonized the Republican Party as being dominated by African Americans. So it is interesting to hear these rewritten parts of our history. When you know the hearts and minds of the people on the Republican side of the aisle, you find out there is nobody who wants slavery. We wish that slavery that held this Nation back--because as Daniel Webster used to preach and John Quincy Adams used to preach, how was a good God going to keep blessing America when we were treating brothers and sisters in Christ this way, putting them in chains and bondage? America was harmed. It was devastating to African American lives to be placed in slavery--the degradation, the humiliation. I am grateful to be part of the party that stood up and made the change. But more than the Republican Party, the Judeo-Christian beliefs, especially in the 1700s after the Great Awakening, the First Great Awakening in America, revival in America where people turned to God, became Christians, they understood travesties better by understanding the Bible. They stood up, and they demanded equal rights for people, and it led to a revolution. In the 1800s, there was a lot of debauchery, but during the Second Great Awakening, churches were really the core behind the abolitionist movement. We should never be putting brothers and sisters in chains. That is an abomination. It held America back. It helped greatly prevent America from reaching the heights that it would once slavery was gone. But then even after slavery was gone, as a result of the great Republican father of our party, Abraham Lincoln, as he is sometimes referred to, people were not treated equally. As I just read, even in Virginia, this great State of Virginia, Democrats were determined to prevent African Americans from voting, and they were successful in large degree. Mr. Speaker, I think a good way to finish today is to go back to the final argument. We have the entire final argument from John Quincy Adams. He was elected President in 1824. He was defeated by Andrew Jackson in 1828. But in 1830 he did an incredible thing that no one has ever done since. After being President, he ran for Congress, for the House of Representatives. He didn't even run for Senate. He ran for the House of Representatives. He believed God was calling him. As William Wilberforce believed God had called him to bring an end to slavery in Great Britain, Adams believed God was calling him back into government after being defeated as President, that he would lower himself to run for the House of Representatives. He got elected in 1830. Speech after speech was against slavery. How can we expect God to bless America when we are treating brothers and sisters with chains and bondage? Sermons were so powerful that those sermons given against slavery, as he filed bills to end slavery, to free specific slaves over and over, those sermons he preached on the floor of the House right down the hall had a powerful impact on a homely-looking guy with an unpleasant sounding voice named Abraham Lincoln. He overlapped briefly before the massive stroke that took John Quincy Adams out. Adams knew when he died back in the Speaker's suite that he had not done what he thought God had called him to do--end slavery. It was 1848. But we now know, and Lincoln knew and said as much, as Steve Mansfield was telling me. He wrote a great book on Lincoln's struggle with God. He knew that those speeches on the House floor down the hall, they didn't end slavery, but they materially changed the attitude and affected that man named Abraham Lincoln that, 13 years after Adams would die, he would see to slavery's end. At the end of his argument, he was afraid he had not prevailed on behalf of Africans who were taken as captives by another African tribe, sold into slavery, and taken to the African coast. They were put on a ship and taken to the Caribbean, where they were put on a smaller ship called the Amistad. ``Amistad'' is a great movie. Longview, Texas, native Matthew McConaughey plays the trial lawyer representing the Africans. Their position was: We are not anybody's property. When the Africans took over the ship, landed accidentally in America, the Spanish said: These people are our property, and this ship is ours. Let us go. The Africans' version: Hey, we are not anybody's property. We want to go home. That case was argued downstairs in the old Supreme Court Chamber. Adams knew if he didn't do an adequate job, those Africans would leave in chains, their children would wear chains; and he was scared to death that he would not have been up to the job, and, as a result, there would be more suffering. We have his exact argument. He finished like this. This is after he had been President. He said: ``Little did I imagine that I should ever again be required to claim the right of appearing in the capacity of an officer of this Court; yet such has been the dictate of my destiny--and I [[Page H2877]] appear again to plead the cause of justice, and now of liberty and life, in behalf of many of my fellow men, before that same Court, which in a former age I had addressed in support of rights of property I stand again, I trust for the last time, before the same Court.'' He goes on to say: ``I stand before the same Court, but not before the same judges--nor aided by the same associates--nor resisted by the same opponents. As I cast my eyes--`` he stood looking at the judges-- ``along those seats of honor and of public trust, now occupied by you, they seek in vain for one of those honored and honorable persons whose indulgence listened then to my voice. Marshall--Cushing--Chase-- Washington--Johnson--Livingston--Todd--where are they? Where is that eloquent statesman and learned lawyer who was my associate counsel in the management of that cause, Robert Goodloe Harper? Where is that brilliant luminary, so long the pride of Maryland and of the American bar, then my opposing counsel, Luther Martin? Where is the excellent clerk of that day, whose name has been inscribed on the shores of Africa, as a monument of his abhorrence of the African slave-trade, Elias B. Caldwell? Where is the marshal--where are the criers of the Court? Alas. Where is one of the very judges of the Court, arbiters of life and death, before whom I commenced this anxious argument, even now prematurely closed? Where are they all? Gone. Gone. All gone--gone from the services which, in their day and generation, they faithfully rendered to their country. From the excellent characters which they sustained in life, so far as I have had the means of knowing, I humbly hope, and fondly trust, that they have gone to receive the rewards of blessedness on high. In taking, then, my final leave of this Bar, and of this honorable Court, I can only . . . ``a fervent petition to Heaven, that every member of it may go to his final account with as little of earthly frailty to answer for as those illustrious dead, and that you may, every one''--talking to the judges--``after the close of a long and virtuous career in this world, be received at the portals of the next with the approving sentence--`Well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' '' We should all hope as such. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_17.csv,44227,44227,44294,"[congressional record volume 162, number 80 (thursday, may 19, 2016)] [house] [pages h2871-h2877] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] issues of the day the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, it is amazing sometimes the way, in the heat of dispute, argument--sometimes [[page h2872]] any of us can have it happen to us--people don't think clearly. i have been here for nearly 11\1/2\ years in congress. it is a tremendous honor to get to be the servant for the people of east texas. but in that 11\1/2\ years, 4 of them the democrats were in the majority, and my friend from maryland (mr. hoyer) was the majority leader during those 4 years, and the rules never changed with regard to how the electronic voting worked. for the last 11\1/2\ years, it has always been the same. and that is, we could take our voting card--and it has a little computer chip in it. it doesn't matter which we way put our card in the box. if the blue light on the box is lit, it means that box is open for voting. most every other row has a voting box on the back. we take our card, and we put it in the slot whichever way. it recognizes the one-of-a-kind computer chip that belongs to that 1 of 435 members, and then you can hit the green button for ``yea,'' the red button the ``nay,'' the yellow button for ``present.'' the blue light is on there. it is next in order on the box, but it can't be pushed. it just lets you know the box is open for voting. toward the end of a vote, particularly a 15-minute vote, the speaker will not have gaveled the vote dead, but oftentimes the box goes dead right before the gavel comes down. even to that point, you can still change your vote, but it is just when the blue light goes out, you can't do it at the box. you have to come down to the well. what i have noticed every year for the last 11\1/2\ years that i have been here, if we are voting on a 15-minute vote--and all of us have probably done it at one time or another--if you need to change your vote, maybe you looked up and, for example, sometimes one person has multiple amendments, and you see their name and it is their amendment, and you say, ``oh, i was not going to vote for that,'' and you vote ``no'' and you need to change your vote to ``yes,'' you can still change your vote at the box. on a 15-minute vote, once you get past 5 minutes, you normally have to come down to the well and get a green card for ``yea,'' a red card for ``nay,'' or a yellow card for ``present'' or ``abstaining'' and change your vote that way. but on a 5-minute vote or a 2-minute vote, if you need to change your vote, you didn't understand the significance, it constantly happens that people change their vote. {time} 1245 but to change their vote, if you have your voting card, you have been able to change it at the box on a 5-minute vote or a 2-minute vote. every now and then, before the gavel comes down, the blue light will go off on the box, so you can no longer change your vote or vote at that box. that is when you hear someone yelling, ``one more, one more,'' and they come rushing down the aisle to get the vote in before the gavel comes down. now, in 11\1/2\ years, only one time has there been a massive and gross violation of the rules the way we have followed them in bringing a vote to a conclusion. i can understand my friend from maryland being sensitive, because this happened on his watch as majority leader. but republicans were in the minority, and yet there was a vote. i don't even remember if it was a bill or an amendment. i think it was an amendment. but the republicans voting against the amendment had enough democrats voting with us that we were bringing down a democratic amendment or bill, and it was left open for enough time that anybody that wanted to change could have changed. when the democrat in the chair felt that enough time had passed, no other changes were being made, and the measure being voted on had failed, then the gavel came down. the rule has always been that when the gavel comes down, there can be no further changing of the vote. perhaps, the majority leader, at that time hoyer, had forgotten. but that was the time they violated their own rules. a subsequent investigation confirmed that. they violated the rules and allowed someone whose arm they were twisting to vote after the gavel came down to change the vote, change the outcome of the vote. that didn't happen here today. and the vote wasn't held open very long at all after the end of the time running out. sometimes, whether it is democrats or republicans in the majority, it runs to zero. but if, in the opinion of the chair or the speaker, there is somebody wanting to change their vote or somebody that is making a good faith effort to get here to vote, they will leave the vote open. sometimes, like when speaker pelosi was meeting with president obama at the white house and wasn't getting back in time, or majority leader hoyer, and they weren't getting back in time, well, that vote would be held open to give them time well beyond the zero, zero, zero, so they could cast that vote. nobody objected because we knew they were making a good faith effort to get here. i understand sometimes we forget things that we have been doing for a number of years. and especially in the heat of debate and a verbal battle here on the floor, people can forget what they have been doing for many, many years. but that has been the way the voting and the rules on voting have worked and been interpreted for many years. so i was greatly surprised to hear the former majority leader challenging on the basis that people didn't come into the well to change their vote on either a 5-minute or a 2-minute vote. well, they have always been able to change their vote. the voting boxes were open. anyway, we all have those mental lapses where we forget things that we have been doing for years. i mean, it just happens, and especially here on the floor. there is nothing to be taken from former majority leader hoyer forgetting how the rules were when he was majority leader and forgetting how they have been all these years since, so no hard feelings. he just had a mental lapse and forgot how the rules have been ever since he has been here the entire time. there has been a great deal of to-do and a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth about what i would term the ``iranian crisis'' because it truly is a crisis that this administration has enabled iran to go ahead and develop nuclear weapons to continue down that path. even though they are supposed to be prohibited, they continued to develop missiles that eventually will be capable of delivering nuclear weapons onto the united states. they have got missiles to deliver them on to israel right now. but as prime minister netanyahu so ably has pointed out from this very rostrum right up here, those missiles they are developing now are not for israel. they can already reach israel. those are for the great satan. so it was deeply troubling to hear the confessions and admissions of the white house adviser consultant mouthpiece, ben rhodes, reveal that the administration--and i am being careful not to use any specific names. i am addressing generally the administration--that the administration had to lie to the american people and had to lie to the house and senate about how evil iran really was and had to talk about how moderate they were when, actually, the fact is, apparently, under the so-called moderate president rouhani, there have been more people put to death than even under the former president ahmadinejad. this man is no moderate. though the american people were fed lies about the negotiations, they were having to negotiate, either directly or indirectly, with the ayatollah khamenei. they don't make big decisions like a nuclear weapons deal, unless the religious leader, the ayatollah khamenei, actually agreed, just like his predecessor, the ayatollah khomeini. so just like with the revelations about obamacare, now that we have had someone working behind the scenes with the administration who revealed, yes, the reason obamacare passed was because people are such fools, they were able to fool them into voting for a bill that was really not anything like what was being represented. and yet along comes ben rhodes, and he admits they did the same thing on obamacare that they did on the iranian treaty. now, i understand the administration has never called it a treaty, and there are people in the senate who have not had the courage to call it a treaty, but it is a treaty. you can't change a nuclear proliferation treaty [[page h2873]] with an executive agreement or an executive order. it can't be done. it has to be done with another treaty. so, clearly, there are a number of things that made clear that the iranian deal was a treaty. it should have been brought to the floor of the senate. it still should be. it is time. you can do it any time this year. you could do it with 51 votes of the senate setting aside cloture and saying, the iranian treaty is a treaty, it is going to allow iran to have nuclear weapons that will allow them to devastate both the little satan, in their opinion israel, and the great satan, the united states, and it needs to be stopped. so, hopefully, the courage will abound eventually in the senate and we will get that vote. and therefore, people with standing could go to court and stop the flood of millions of dollars to iran, which has already said that with the billions of dollars, $100 billion to $150 billion in the first year this administration is going to make available, they are going to commit so much more to terrorism than they ever had. then we get this story just a few days ago from the washington free beacon entitled, iran shows off third underground missile site. it says: ``iran's military recently publicized a third underground missile facility and showed the launch of a new ballistic missile through the top of a mountain. ``it was the third time since october that tehran showed off an extensive network of underground missile facilities. the new video, however, for the first time, shows a missile launch from one of the country's underground launch facilities. ``disclosure of the new video comes as iran this week conducted the third launch of a ballistic missile since january, when the nuclear deal aimed at curbing iran's nuclear weapons development went into effect.'' and i would submit, that part of the story is inaccurate. it is being considered to have gone into effect, but it is a treaty that was never ratified by the u.s. senate, and it is an ineffective treaty. but the obama administration is choosing to act as if the iranian agreement really is an effective treaty. iran has shown they have no intention of following that agreement. they have violated it a number of times. and the only reason iran would have the gall to go forward and say, hey, look, we have got a third underground missile site, we are going to let you see a launch, we don't care that the world knows that we are violating this last agreement with obama and kerry and wendy sherman that helped give north korea nuclear weapons in the clinton administration, we don't care that they know because we have now seen that this administration will not stand up to us, they will let us push them around, they will even let us take their soldiers or their naval officers, their naval seamen captive, violate virtually every treaty on the treatment of prisoners, humiliate the american sailors, force them to lie on camera, and after all that is said and done, we will get the secretary of state to come back and thank us. i mean, it is like from ``animal house,'' kevin bacon being beaten saying, thank you, sir, may i have another? iran has figured out they are the senior pledges, and this administration will take a beating and keep asking, thank you, sir, may i have another? and iran is all that willing to give them another and another. the trouble is this isn't a comedy movie, this is real life. christians and jews are being targeted, persecuted, and killed in greater numbers than at any time in the history of the world. the middle east is on fire, except israel is a place of stability. but if this administration has its will, it will become a powder keg before long as well. libya had become more stable. and after the united states went into iraq, because saddam hussein continued to refuse to abide by the orders of the u.n. that were passed by huge majorities, requiring them to disclose what they had, he wouldn't comply, most everybody was-- including those who now say, i voted for it, i really wasn't for it-- but, at the time, people thought, look, this guy must have something to hide because he is certainly not letting us get in to see what weapons he has. other reports indicate that they had been taken from iraq and were no longer present. but either way, it scared qadhafi enough that, as some of the israeli leaders have told me, we were shocked when you provided the firepower, the planes, and the bombs that made it possible to eliminate qadhafi because, yeah, he had blood on his hands before 2003, but after 2003, he helped you more in fighting terrorism than anybody but us, and you took him out, and look what happened as a result. {time} 1300 it turned egypt upside down. there are problems in albania, problems all over north africa, problems for the middle east and north africa both, problems coming down now of radical islamists in nigeria and other, more central african countries. they have paid a heavy price for the improper leadership of this administration here in the united states. it is just tragic how many have lost their lives already. then we hear reports that in nigeria--and i heard it when i was in nigeria and was trying to help the nigerian families whose daughters had been abducted--that this administration, behind the scenes, was saying: look, we will help you with boko haram, with the terrorism-- although they don't like to use that word--with the radical extremism that is occurring in nigeria. if you will change your laws, violate your religious beliefs, allow same-sex marriage, and pay for abortion, then we will help you. as one nigerian catholic bishop said: our religious beliefs are not for sale, not to the u.s. president, not to anybody. i have an article that goes on about the situation with iran. this is also from may 12: ``kerry's peculiar message about iran for european banks.'' it reads: ``u.s. secretary of state john kerry met thursday in london with a group of european financial institutions for a discussion about `iranian banking matters.' the meeting, which followed repeated complaints by iranian officials that they aren't getting the benefit of the bargain under the nuclear deal, was an effort by the state department to persuade major non-u.s. banks that doing iran-related business is not only permitted following the relaxation of iran sanctions, but is actually encouraged. ``the irony will not be lost on these financial institutions. most of them were similarly gathered almost 10 years ago by u.s. treasury henry paulson to discuss iranian banking matters, but that discussion focused on protecting the integrity of the global financial system against the risk posed by iran. ``in the decade that followed, the george w. bush and obama administrations, as well as the u.k. and other governments, the european union, and the united nations, all imposed extensive sanctions targeting iran's illicit and deceptive conduct. banks were briefed extensively and repeatedly by the u.s. treasury department on the details of iran's conduct. the financial action task force, the global standard-setting body for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, warned about the financial crime risks posed by iran as a jurisdiction. the result: iran became a financial pariah. ``no one has claimed that iran has ceased to engage in much of the same conduct for which it was sanctioned, including actively supporting terrorism and building and testing ballistic missiles; but now washington is pushing non-u.s. banks to do what is still illegal for american banks to do. ``this is a very odd position for the u.s. government to be taking.'' it is shocking that this administration continues to be complicit with the largest supporter of terrorism in the world. how many lives will be lost because of this complicity? there was a time when america would not tolerate the kind of treatment of americans that occurred to our seamen when they were taken captive. not only did we not come to their defense, we praised iran and thanked them for being so gracious for the manner in which they abused our sailors. this article goes on. it reads: ``on the one hand, washington is continuing to prohibit american banks and companies from doing iran-related business. in february, the fatf''--that is the financial action task [[page h2874]] force--``reaffirmed its prior concerns about the 'serious threat' iran poses to the international financial system, urging countries to apply effective countermeasures. the u.s. treasury department's designation of iran, including its central bank and financial institutions, as a primary money laundering concern also still stands. as part of that designation, treasury determined that `the international financial system is increasingly vulnerable to the risk that otherwise responsible financial institutions will, unwittingly, participate in iran's illicit activities.' ``on the other hand, mr. kerry wants non-u.s. banks to do business with iran without a u.s. repudiation of its prior statements about the associated financial crime risks. there are no assurances as to how such activity would subsequently be viewed by u.s. regulatory and law enforcement authorities, which might seek to take enforcement action against banks that enter the iranian market and run afoul of complicated u.s. restrictions. the state department neither controls nor plays any meaningful role in the enforcement decisions of these authorities. ``washington has warned repeatedly that the islamic revolutionary guard corps controls broad swaths of the iranian economy. the irgc remains sanctioned by both the united states and the european union because of the central role it plays in iran's illicit conduct. when the u.s., eu, and u.n. removed sanctions from several hundred iranian banks and companies, there were no assurances that the conduct of those banks and companies had changed. ``this will present a challenge for european banks. hsbc is endeavoring to implement consistent and high standards across its global operations, designed to combat financial crime and prevent abuse by illicit actors. we have more work to do, but achieving that objective is one of our highest priorities. this approach is rightly expected by our regulators, including in the u.k. and the u.s. ``our decisions will be driven by the financial crime risks and the underlying conduct. for these reasons, hsbc has no intention of doing any new business involving iran. governments can lift sanctions, but the private sector is still responsible for managing its own risk and, no doubt, will be held accountable if it falls short.'' that was from may 12, and it appears to be somebody who certainly knows the banking business. i would like to comment a bit about, again, our illegal immigration problems and our porous borders because the administration continues to act as if all is well--all is well--when it is not well. an article from may 19: ``previously deported illegal alien allegedly killed prom teen.'' ``the man that houston police say was driving drunk and evading arrest when he crashed into a car, killing a young woman on her way home from the prom, is listed by federal officials as a previously deported illegal alien.'' ``edin palacios-rodas, a 27-year-old previously deported illegal alien from guatemala, has now had an immigration detainer placed on him after being processed into the harris county jail on one count of felony murder and one count of felony evading resulting in death and serious bodily injury.'' it is still going on. with that going on, this administration continues to push for and has allies in congress pushing for what they are calling sentencing reform when, actually, it won't be reform as much as it will be rather devastating. the pendulum on criminal justice swings back and forth. most history shows that it has always been and probably will always be, whether a totalitarian government or a democratic republic such as ours. my friend in the senate, senator jeff sessions, has an article, again, from may 19 that reads: ``senator jeff sessions warns that congress must be careful to ensure the sentencing reductions bills pending before congress did not boost already rising crime rates and `sign death warrants' for innocent victims.'' ``the sentencing reform and correction act, which the alabama republican opposes, hews to obama's anti-law enforcement agenda and could cost an enormous human toll, senator sessions said. `frankly, this is obama's policy and the attorney general who he's appointed, loretta lynch's policy, and eric holder's before her, to basically cut people's sentences that have been lawfully imposed throughout this country, and it's impacting public safety and will continue to do so in the future.' ``the senator also highlighted many high-profile cop killings as the obama administration makes police work more difficult. ``he said, `in the last year, we've lost 123 police officers, 35 in the first 4 months of 2016. violent crimes and murders have increased across the country at alarming rates. let me just share with my colleagues some of the things we're seeing in violent crime. recently, the major cities chiefs of police association, a long-established group, called an emergency meeting to deal with the numbers i'm going to share with you today.' ``the numbers i will quote represent the percentage increase in total murders in the first quarter of this year, 2016, over the first quarter . . . of 2015. las vegas: 82 percent increase.'' this is the murder increase. ``dallas, texas: 73 percent increase. chicago: 70 percent. jacksonville, florida: 67 percent. newark, new jersey: 60 percent increase. miami-dade: 38 percent. los angeles: 33 percent.'' and on and on. ``these are substantial increases in crime. according to fbi statistics released just this year, the number of violent crimes committed across the country was up in the first half of 2015 compared with the same period of 2014.'' so, actually, we are going up and up, and the percentage increase in these cities of 82 percent, 73 percent, and a 70 percent increase is even more dramatic than that when you go back 2 years. sessions also quoted fbi director james comey's concerns about the rising tide of crime. `` `i was very worried about it last fall, and i am, in many ways, more worried because the numbers are not only going up, they're continuing to go up in most of those cities faster than they were going up last year. something is happening. i don't know what the answer is, but, holy cow, do we have a problem.''' yes, we do have a problem. one of the answers is mentioned in this article, again, from may 19, entitled: ``obama doesn't think rapists, armed robbers, drug dealers are criminals.'' i think i found the euphemism of the year. ``according to team obama, criminals should now be declared `justice- involved individuals.' ``the neo-orwellianism comes to us from the bizarre flurry of last- minute dictates, regulations, and bone-chilling threats, collectively known to fanboys as obama's gorgeous good-bye. ``in another of those smiley faced but deeply sinister `dear colleague' letters sent to universities and colleges this week, obama's education secretary, john king, discouraged colleges from asking applicants whether they were convicted criminals.'' {time} 1315 it used to be a matter of common sense. most americans wanted to know. especially in dormitories that have now become co-ed, where you have men and women living in and with and around each other, it was considered valuable information to know if your daughter was going to be living in, around, or with a convicted rapist. that was thought to be good information, but apparently that is no longer considered by this administration as good information. people all across america have shown an interest in knowing whether there are child molesters in their neighborhood where their children are growing up and children are playing around the area. they want to know if their child is at risk because they know there is a significant recidivism rate, particularly among child molesters. yet, this administration says it is time to stop calling criminals criminals. again, that is in keeping with the unwillingness to call radical islamist, as the muslim leader of egypt, our friend, president el-sisi, calls it--i mean, it is radical islamists. he has had the courage to tell imams themselves that we have to get control again of islam and wrestle it back away from the radical islamists. [[page h2875]] as my friend, carolyn glick, pointed out in the jerusalem post, by this administration's refusal to call radical islam radical islam, it betrays our allies who are muslim--like president el-sisi in egypt--who are wanting muslims to stand up and say that these islamists should not be allowed to represent our religion because they know that they do. when you have a man with multiple degrees in islamic studies saying that, yes, radical islam is the ultimate islam and, on the other hand, you have a president who did go to school in indonesia in muslim schools and elementary school but does not have any degrees in islamic studies, like the world expert in islamic studies, al-qaradawi, well, one is president of the united states with no degrees in islamic studies, and he says it is not islam. but a man who has studied islam his whole life and has multiple degrees, including a ph.d., says not only is it islam, as the head of isis as he is, this is islam the way it should be. we should be giving assistance to our allies, giving them cover by not going on with this facade where this administration refuses to call radical islam radical islam. they call radical islamic terrorism exactly what it is. they are not helping our friends around the world that are trying to stand up and do the right thing. you could go back to libya, the attack of benghazi. we now know from what has been gathered from emails and information that secretary clinton basically told the president of libya: we know that this benghazi attack was not on a video, in essence, and that it was a planned attack. she told her daughter. yet, she went out, as did susan rice, representing this administration and told us all, oh, it was all about the video; telling victims families that we are going to get the guy who did the video. victims families from benghazi have told me personally, when secretary clinton said we are going to get the guys that did the videos, which she now says she didn't say--how tragic is that? so basically calling these victims' families liars. but the families say, when she said we will get the guy that did the video, they were infuriated. they said: we didn't care about the guy that did some video. we wanted our government to get the guys that killed our loved one, and that was not the message. you have to understand that there were a lot of things to do, there were promises to keep, and miles to go before they slept. but we don't know if they just went to bed and slept. when they found out the personal ambassador of the secretary of state was missing, clinton and president obama, did they just go to bed? they won't tell us. we know president obama had a very important engagement the next day. he had to fly out early to las vegas for a big campaign speech. we know. we understand. hey, that was more pressing. we got that. we understand. to him, that was more pressing. what do you do? do you go to sleep when you get word that your personal ambassador is missing? for the first time since 1979, an ambassador ends up being killed. he wasn't given adequate protection. now, we are hearing more and more reports from people that the assets were there to go help. they could have saved at least two, maybe more of the four, but they were not allowed go and save the american heroes. well, there is an article from conservative review entitled ``busted: the 10 most dangerous myths about criminal justice reform'' that is being pushed especially by this administration. and we do have some colleagues here in the house and senate that are as well. ``myth number one: the prison population keeps growing, even though crime is declining.'' ``fact: the d.c. intelligentsia argues our criminal justice system is in dire need of reform. but ask anyone outside the beltway, and they'll give you a different definition of `broken.' many americans would agree that current laws are too lenient on criminals and disregard the victim all too often. it was the tough reforms put into place during the reagan years and in the '90s that produced the sharpest decline in violent crime on record. those reforms, coupled with more aggressive policing, led to the only positive social trend in public policy in recent memory. that trend is now being reversed precisely as incarceration rates decline and obama and his allies ratchet up the war against law enforcement. while correlation doesn't necessarily prove causation, the correlation is indeed striking and in conjunction with the defanging of local police departments, the release of tens of thousands of federal prisoners can only result in exacerbating this negative trajectory.'' from the information that the fbi provided to senator sessions, we know about maybe less than 1 percent of federal inmates in federal prison are there for possession of a controlled substance; that most are there for more. ninety-nine percent or so are there for more than that. but those that have been involved in the criminal justice system, both in the state side, as i was, and on the federal side--i mean, we work with each other. and we know the federal government never had interest, that i ever saw, in simple possession cases. where the federal government had interest is if a real bad guy--maybe he had been involved in a shooting, a killing, a robbing, a possession--but they wanted him to turn on his boss so they could get the bigger fish. they had to offer something to get him to turn, and they would offer--i have seen it many times--okay, we can't have a plea agreement where we set a certain sentence, as they do in state court, but what we can do is agree to drop all the charges, except this one possession. so the sentence is not that great. whatever the judge does won't be that great. it won't have the weapons charge in there, even though he used a weapon and engaged in violent activity, if he will help us get mr. big. that happens. i have seen it happened. back in the early '80s, when i was court appointed in federal court, i had approaches like that with regard to my clients: what can you help us with, and here are the charges we are willing to drop, even though we know we can prove them. yet, this administration acts like that never happens and that, obviously, all these people in prison because of drug charges are really nonviolent. that is garbage. that is why the crime rate keeps going up as this administration forces the release of more and more people. this article points out another myth: ``there are millions of people incarcerated in american prisons for no good reason.'' ``fact: while there are approximately 1.5 million people incarcerated in american jails, prisons, and other institutions, only 195,900 are federal inmates (a 10-year low). and only 159,000 in the federal system are housed in actual prisons. the rest are in privately managed facilities, home confinement, short-term detention, long-term boarders, residential reentry centers, pretrial/presentence holding, et cetera. at least 25 percent of the federal prison population is comprised of illegal aliens and possibly more who are noncitizens. we should save money by releasing those criminals and deporting them.'' what good does it do to deport somebody now when the border is so wide open? ``myth number 3: incarceration costs so much money and criminal justice reform will save billions.'' well, without reading through the whole article, i can tell you that is garbage as well. myth number 4: ``this bill will only release low level, nonviolent drug offenders.'' as i pointed out, that is simply not the case. it is a good article. myth number 5: ``we have a big government culture of overcriminalization that threatens liberty.'' well, the biggest problem of overcriminalization is when congress has passed a law that says you can go to prison for violating any of the regulations regarding this subject, and then bureaucrats in some cubicle somewhere put some regulations in place under this administration--sometimes 80,000 pages of new regulations a year--and people, as the heritage foundation has said before in one of their books, are probably all violating three or four federal laws a day. one other thing i wanted to touch on because it has been debated and a lot of [[page h2876]] allegations made, people are trying to assert that republicans somehow are supportive of the old ways of slavery. mr. speaker, i just want to read from the democratic party platform of 1856. this is a part of the platform. this is the belief of the democratic party, the national party: ``that congress has no power under the constitution, to interfere with or control the domestic institutions of the several states, and that such states are the sole and proper judges of everything appertaining to their own affairs, not prohibited by the constitution; that all efforts of the abolitionists''--that is those who wanted to end slavery--``or others, made to induce congress to interfere with questions of slavery . . . are calculated to lead to the most alarming and dangerous consequences; and that all such efforts''--talking about the end of slavery--``have an inevitable tendency to diminish the happiness of the people and endanger the stability and permanency of the union, and ought not to be countenanced by any friend of our political institutions.'' the democratic party platform of 1856 also declares that ``new states'' to the union should be admitted ``with or without domestic slavery, as the state may elect.'' the platform that year also says that ``we recognize the right of the people of all the territories . . . to form a constitution, with or without domestic slavery.'' {time} 1330 the platform of 1860 of the national democratic party, in seeking to uphold the fugitive slave act, states: ``the enactments of the state legislatures to defeat the faithful execution of the fugitive slave act are hostile in character, subversive of the constitution, and revolutionary in their effect.'' the 14th amendment, giving full citizenship to freed slaves, passed in 1868 with 94 percent republican support and zero percent democratic support in congress. the 15th amendment, giving freed slaves the right to vote, passed in 1870 with 100 percent republican support and zero percent democratic support in congress. the constitution of 1902 in the state of virginia disenfranchised about 90 percent of the black men who still voted at the beginning of the 20th century and nearly half of the white men. the number of eligible african american voters fell from about 147,000 in 1901 to about 10,000 by 1905. the measure was supported almost entirely by virginia state democrats. in 1924, the democratic national convention convened in new york at madison square garden. the convention is commonly known as the klanbake due to the overwhelming influence of the ku klux klan in the party. in 1964, the democratic party led a 75-day filibuster against the 1964 civil rights act. leading the democrats in their opposition to civil rights for african americans was a member of the democratic party, senator robert byrd from west virginia, who was known to be a recruiter for the ku klux klan. senator byrd spoke directly about the civil rights act in a 14-hour filibuster, proclaiming: ``men are not equal today, and they were not created equal in 1776, when the declaration of independence was written. men and races of men differ in appearance, ways, physical power, mental capacity, creativity, and vision.'' the democratic party identified itself as the ``white man's party'' and demonized the republican party as being dominated by african americans. so it is interesting to hear these rewritten parts of our history. when you know the hearts and minds of the people on the republican side of the aisle, you find out there is nobody who wants slavery. we wish that slavery that held this nation back--because as daniel webster used to preach and john quincy adams used to preach, how was a good god going to keep blessing america when we were treating brothers and sisters in christ this way, putting them in chains and bondage? america was harmed. it was devastating to african american lives to be placed in slavery--the degradation, the humiliation. i am grateful to be part of the party that stood up and made the change. but more than the republican party, the judeo-christian beliefs, especially in the 1700s after the great awakening, the first great awakening in america, revival in america where people turned to god, became christians, they understood travesties better by understanding the bible. they stood up, and they demanded equal rights for people, and it led to a revolution. in the 1800s, there was a lot of debauchery, but during the second great awakening, churches were really the core behind the abolitionist movement. we should never be putting brothers and sisters in chains. that is an abomination. it held america back. it helped greatly prevent america from reaching the heights that it would once slavery was gone. but then even after slavery was gone, as a result of the great republican father of our party, abraham lincoln, as he is sometimes referred to, people were not treated equally. as i just read, even in virginia, this great state of virginia, democrats were determined to prevent african americans from voting, and they were successful in large degree. mr. speaker, i think a good way to finish today is to go back to the final argument. we have the entire final argument from john quincy adams. he was elected president in 1824. he was defeated by andrew jackson in 1828. but in 1830 he did an incredible thing that no one has ever done since. after being president, he ran for congress, for the house of representatives. he didn't even run for senate. he ran for the house of representatives. he believed god was calling him. as william wilberforce believed god had called him to bring an end to slavery in great britain, adams believed god was calling him back into government after being defeated as president, that he would lower himself to run for the house of representatives. he got elected in 1830. speech after speech was against slavery. how can we expect god to bless america when we are treating brothers and sisters with chains and bondage? sermons were so powerful that those sermons given against slavery, as he filed bills to end slavery, to free specific slaves over and over, those sermons he preached on the floor of the house right down the hall had a powerful impact on a homely-looking guy with an unpleasant sounding voice named abraham lincoln. he overlapped briefly before the massive stroke that took john quincy adams out. adams knew when he died back in the speaker's suite that he had not done what he thought god had called him to do--end slavery. it was 1848. but we now know, and lincoln knew and said as much, as steve mansfield was telling me. he wrote a great book on lincoln's struggle with god. he knew that those speeches on the house floor down the hall, they didn't end slavery, but they materially changed the attitude and affected that man named abraham lincoln that, 13 years after adams would die, he would see to slavery's end. at the end of his argument, he was afraid he had not prevailed on behalf of africans who were taken as captives by another african tribe, sold into slavery, and taken to the african coast. they were put on a ship and taken to the caribbean, where they were put on a smaller ship called the amistad. ``amistad'' is a great movie. longview, texas, native matthew mcconaughey plays the trial lawyer representing the africans. their position was: we are not anybody's property. when the africans took over the ship, landed accidentally in america, the spanish said: these people are our property, and this ship is ours. let us go. the africans' version: hey, we are not anybody's property. we want to go home. that case was argued downstairs in the old supreme court chamber. adams knew if he didn't do an adequate job, those africans would leave in chains, their children would wear chains; and he was scared to death that he would not have been up to the job, and, as a result, there would be more suffering. we have his exact argument. he finished like this. this is after he had been president. he said: ``little did i imagine that i should ever again be required to claim the right of appearing in the capacity of an officer of this court; yet such has been the dictate of my destiny--and i [[page h2877]] appear again to plead the cause of justice, and now of liberty and life, in behalf of many of my fellow men, before that same court, which in a former age i had addressed in support of rights of property i stand again, i trust for the last time, before the same court.'' he goes on to say: ``i stand before the same court, but not before the same judges--nor aided by the same associates--nor resisted by the same opponents. as i cast my eyes--`` he stood looking at the judges-- ``along those seats of honor and of public trust, now occupied by you, they seek in vain for one of those honored and honorable persons whose indulgence listened then to my voice. marshall--cushing--chase-- washington--johnson--livingston--todd--where are they? where is that eloquent statesman and learned lawyer who was my associate counsel in the management of that cause, robert goodloe harper? where is that brilliant luminary, so long the pride of maryland and of the american bar, then my opposing counsel, luther martin? where is the excellent clerk of that day, whose name has been inscribed on the shores of africa, as a monument of his abhorrence of the african slave-trade, elias b. caldwell? where is the marshal--where are the criers of the court? alas. where is one of the very judges of the court, arbiters of life and death, before whom i commenced this anxious argument, even now prematurely closed? where are they all? gone. gone. all gone--gone from the services which, in their day and generation, they faithfully rendered to their country. from the excellent characters which they sustained in life, so far as i have had the means of knowing, i humbly hope, and fondly trust, that they have gone to receive the rewards of blessedness on high. in taking, then, my final leave of this bar, and of this honorable court, i can only . . . ``a fervent petition to heaven, that every member of it may go to his final account with as little of earthly frailty to answer for as those illustrious dead, and that you may, every one''--talking to the judges--``after the close of a long and virtuous career in this world, be received at the portals of the next with the approving sentence--`well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.' '' we should all hope as such. i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",44227

CREC-2016-05-19-pt1-PgS3003-5,CREC-2016-05-19,114,FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3003-S3004] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION Mr. REID. Mr. President, I come to the floor today not to talk about a political issue, in the real sense of the word--not Democrat versus Republican--but a very difficult sensitive issue. It is hard to talk about, but we as a nation can't keep ignoring this important topic. It has been more than 20 years since I learned about something called female genital mutilation, known as FGM. Since then, I have spoken often against this awful procedure and the devastating effect it has on women and girls around the world. A number of people warned me 20 years ago that this isn't a subject I should talk about. It was taboo. They thought it would be untoward for me to do so. But I told them I had to because no one else was talking about it. So I am going to continue doing everything I can to bring attention to this issue and fight to end this horrible, awful, brutal practice perpetrated against women and girls. It was a 1994 cable news program that introduced me to this practice. One of my friends in Las Vegas said: You can't imagine this. This was a young woman who sent this to me. I didn't expect getting this from her or anyone else. But we were friends, and so I watched this. She said: You have to. And I did: A 10-year-old little girl in a party dress held down by two men, her legs spread apart, and she was brutally mutilated as her genitals were cut away. These images have continually haunted me over the years. I will never ever forget the picture that I saw. There are different forms of female genital mutilation around the world. The most severe and atrocious is the one in which the girl's genitals are cut away. But then the little girls are literally sewn shut, leaving only a small opening for urine and menstrual blood. Though FGM is performed for different reasons around the world. One thing is very clear: Whatever rationality you try to give to this practice, it is a form of control and oppression of women and girls. In addition to the psychological impact, this form of gender-based violence has serious medical risks, including death, of course. It is recognized by the United Nations as a human rights violation, as it should be. But FGM is still happening. As we speak, 200 million women and girls worldwide have undergone FGM--200 million women and girls who are alive today who have undergone that procedure that I watched on cable news, or something like it. More than two decades after I first saw that program, women and girls are still being hacked, mutilated. It is not done in a hospital, an operating room. It is done in very unsanitary conditions most of the time. This practice remains prevalent in at least 30 countries. In some places, the rates of FGM are higher than 90 percent--90 percent. In many of these countries, girls are cut before the age of 5. In most places they are cut between the ages of 5 and 14. In many of these countries, girls--well, enough. Imagine that--girls who haven't even started school yet, of kindergarten age or younger, being subjected to this horror. Because of these millions of girls, I have spent more than 20 years trying to do something about it. I have worked hard to pass legislation outlawing the practice in the United States and banning so-called vacation cutting, which goes on when young girls are shipped overseas. Because it is illegal here, due to the laws we passed, they take them overseas to be cut. There was some bipartisan support, obviously, for this. It is not a partisan issue. We were able to have a few victories--certainly not enough, but some. Still, this brutal practice continues around the world, and it is clear there must be much more done--much more done. That is why, at my request, the General Accountability Office began a study on the American Government's efforts to stop this practice. The GAO has now completed its report about our government's international efforts. It wasn't much of a report. It was kind of short. The report is shameful in terms of what we have not done. The title of the report says it all: ``Female Genital Mutilation/ Cutting: [[Page S3004]] U.S. Assistance to Combat This Harmful Practice Abroad is Limited.'' And ``limited'' is an understatement. I am publicly releasing this report today, which outlines the U.S. Government's limited--limited--efforts. I am terribly disappointed. I am embarrassed that the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development are not fully engaged in dedicating resources to put an end to this. According to the GAO report, USAID and the State Department each had just one active stand-alone project focused on stopping female genital mutilation. One of these projects is gone--already ended. Less than $2 million has been spent on these projects combined. The GAO also found that the United States has never contributed-- never contributed--a penny to the world's largest international effort against this horrible, awful practice. It is called the Joint Programme on FGM/C. It is embarrassing. We have not put one penny into this. During the course of the GAO investigation, State and USAID both began to take action. They were embarrassed, I assume. If they weren't, they should have been. But they haven't done much. USAID, for example, decided to update the guidance it released 16 years ago, and Secretary Kerry recently announced that the United States will be contributing to the Joint Programme for the first time. Bravo. I commend this commitment, but I understand these funds are not a dedicated funding source. They are just a one-time, very limited pledge. Maybe we will have to get another GAO report before we get something into that program. It shouldn't take a GAO investigation for State and USAID to act. The United States should prioritize ending this practice, but it hasn't. This is shameful. It is a tragedy that our great government is not doing more. It is inexcusable that the United States, a nation with wealth and power, is standing by while such sickening violence against women and girls is occurring. As we speak, 200 million have undergone this in the world--200 million. The State Department and USAID should end it or do everything they can to make female genital mutilation a priority and dedicate substantial resources to this issue. It is a cause. It should be, if it isn't. The United States can and must do far more to eliminate this practice worldwide. We still have problems here in the United States. This shameful GAO report, I hope, is a wake-up call. Something had to wake us up because we have done almost nothing as a country. The report should be a turning point in the fight against FGM, a moment when the most powerful nation in the world commences the stopping of this brutal form of abuse. The United States should be a leader in this fight and not a bystander. We must put this brutal practice to an end. America must lead the world in stopping these assaults of little girls and big girls and women. I hope the Senate will join me in these efforts. Mr. President, I don't see anyone on the floor. I ask the Chair to announce the business of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3003-S3004] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION Mr. REID.

I ask the Chair to announce the business of the day. ____________________",package_114_17.csv,7341,7341,7408,"[congressional record volume 162, number 80 (thursday, may 19, 2016)] [senate] [pages s3003-s3004] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] female genital mutilation mr. reid. mr. president, i come to the floor today not to talk about a political issue, in the real sense of the word--not democrat versus republican--but a very difficult sensitive issue. it is hard to talk about, but we as a nation can't keep ignoring this important topic. it has been more than 20 years since i learned about something called female genital mutilation, known as fgm. since then, i have spoken often against this awful procedure and the devastating effect it has on women and girls around the world. a number of people warned me 20 years ago that this isn't a subject i should talk about. it was taboo. they thought it would be untoward for me to do so. but i told them i had to because no one else was talking about it. so i am going to continue doing everything i can to bring attention to this issue and fight to end this horrible, awful, brutal practice perpetrated against women and girls. it was a 1994 cable news program that introduced me to this practice. one of my friends in las vegas said: you can't imagine this. this was a young woman who sent this to me. i didn't expect getting this from her or anyone else. but we were friends, and so i watched this. she said: you have to. and i did: a 10-year-old little girl in a party dress held down by two men, her legs spread apart, and she was brutally mutilated as her genitals were cut away. these images have continually haunted me over the years. i will never ever forget the picture that i saw. there are different forms of female genital mutilation around the world. the most severe and atrocious is the one in which the girl's genitals are cut away. but then the little girls are literally sewn shut, leaving only a small opening for urine and menstrual blood. though fgm is performed for different reasons around the world. one thing is very clear: whatever rationality you try to give to this practice, it is a form of control and oppression of women and girls. in addition to the psychological impact, this form of gender-based violence has serious medical risks, including death, of course. it is recognized by the united nations as a human rights violation, as it should be. but fgm is still happening. as we speak, 200 million women and girls worldwide have undergone fgm--200 million women and girls who are alive today who have undergone that procedure that i watched on cable news, or something like it. more than two decades after i first saw that program, women and girls are still being hacked, mutilated. it is not done in a hospital, an operating room. it is done in very unsanitary conditions most of the time. this practice remains prevalent in at least 30 countries. in some places, the rates of fgm are higher than 90 percent--90 percent. in many of these countries, girls are cut before the age of 5. in most places they are cut between the ages of 5 and 14. in many of these countries, girls--well, enough. imagine that--girls who haven't even started school yet, of kindergarten age or younger, being subjected to this horror. because of these millions of girls, i have spent more than 20 years trying to do something about it. i have worked hard to pass legislation outlawing the practice in the united states and banning so-called vacation cutting, which goes on when young girls are shipped overseas. because it is illegal here, due to the laws we passed, they take them overseas to be cut. there was some bipartisan support, obviously, for this. it is not a partisan issue. we were able to have a few victories--certainly not enough, but some. still, this brutal practice continues around the world, and it is clear there must be much more done--much more done. that is why, at my request, the general accountability office began a study on the american government's efforts to stop this practice. the gao has now completed its report about our government's international efforts. it wasn't much of a report. it was kind of short. the report is shameful in terms of what we have not done. the title of the report says it all: ``female genital mutilation/ cutting: [[page s3004]] u.s. assistance to combat this harmful practice abroad is limited.'' and ``limited'' is an understatement. i am publicly releasing this report today, which outlines the u.s. government's limited--limited--efforts. i am terribly disappointed. i am embarrassed that the state department and the u.s. agency for international development are not fully engaged in dedicating resources to put an end to this. according to the gao report, usaid and the state department each had just one active stand-alone project focused on stopping female genital mutilation. one of these projects is gone--already ended. less than $2 million has been spent on these projects combined. the gao also found that the united states has never contributed-- never contributed--a penny to the world's largest international effort against this horrible, awful practice. it is called the joint programme on fgm/c. it is embarrassing. we have not put one penny into this. during the course of the gao investigation, state and usaid both began to take action. they were embarrassed, i assume. if they weren't, they should have been. but they haven't done much. usaid, for example, decided to update the guidance it released 16 years ago, and secretary kerry recently announced that the united states will be contributing to the joint programme for the first time. bravo. i commend this commitment, but i understand these funds are not a dedicated funding source. they are just a one-time, very limited pledge. maybe we will have to get another gao report before we get something into that program. it shouldn't take a gao investigation for state and usaid to act. the united states should prioritize ending this practice, but it hasn't. this is shameful. it is a tragedy that our great government is not doing more. it is inexcusable that the united states, a nation with wealth and power, is standing by while such sickening violence against women and girls is occurring. as we speak, 200 million have undergone this in the world--200 million. the state department and usaid should end it or do everything they can to make female genital mutilation a priority and dedicate substantial resources to this issue. it is a cause. it should be, if it isn't. the united states can and must do far more to eliminate this practice worldwide. we still have problems here in the united states. this shameful gao report, i hope, is a wake-up call. something had to wake us up because we have done almost nothing as a country. the report should be a turning point in the fight against fgm, a moment when the most powerful nation in the world commences the stopping of this brutal form of abuse. the united states should be a leader in this fight and not a bystander. we must put this brutal practice to an end. america must lead the world in stopping these assaults of little girls and big girls and women. i hope the senate will join me in these efforts. mr. president, i don't see anyone on the floor. i ask the chair to announce the business of the day. ____________________",7341

CREC-2016-05-19-pt1-PgS3019-2,CREC-2016-05-19,114,INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3019-S3021] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, there is an ongoing debate in our politics today about the value of leadership around the world in the 21st century. There is a view that seems to be gaining traction and favor--that our international engagement is one-sided, that our allies are free riders, that we contribute too much and get too little in return, and so why should we be involved in the world? These voices exist in both parties, and I would like to answer them today. I want to start by looking back at the last century, when the world emerged from the death and destruction of the Second World War. The United States could have decided after that war to wall ourselves off-- that after the loss of so many of our best and brightest, we had already paid enough for peace. Instead, our country became the driving force behind international [[Page S3020]] order. We forged a series of strong alliances, led with moral clarity, and positioned our military strength strategically around the world. In doing so, the American people benefitted immensely as we helped to stave off the threat of another global conflict and oversaw decades of economic growth and the spread of democracy and freedom around the world. Then, like now, our people benefitted tremendously from our status in the world, even though our engagement was disproportional to that of other nations; in fact, we benefitted precisely because our engagement was disproportional to that of other nations. International engagement has never been a business deal. International engagement is not a transaction in which we give something tangible and receive something tangible in return. America has more to give to the nations we are helping, and that is one of the reasons why we have a responsibility to lead. It is written in the Bible: ``From everyone who has been given much, much will be required.'' But our leadership ends up paying dividends for the entire world, and especially for the American people. First of all, American workers and families benefit economically. International affairs have a bigger impact on the financial well-being of our people today than ever before. In our global economy, someone on the other side of the planet can now buy a product from an American with the tap of a finger. But when nations or entire regions are torn apart by war and by oppression, they become closed off, and economic growth in our own country is restricted as a result. If America were to fail to protect the openness of international waters, global shipping would be threatened and prices would rise for consumers on virtually everything. Similarly, if space and cyber space became threatened or restricted, global communications and commerce would suffer as well. Americans also see real benefits in terms of our safety at home and around the world. Without American leadership, regional order tends to break down, and then instability spreads. This opens up vacuums that are filled up by radicals, and those radicals always--irrespective of what we are doing or what we are not doing--target America, and they do so either to bolster their own prestige or for ideological reasons or often for both. As President Obama has found, leaving the Middle East doesn't mean terrorists stop trying to kill Americans. Our families, our homeland, and our men and women in uniform are less safe when America disengages from the world. We also benefit geopolitically when we help other nations. Think what Europe would look like if it had not been for America's moral and strategic leadership during the Cold War. Europe still faces many challenges today, mainly because of our neglect of the crisis in Syria, but for centuries prior, Europe was driven by conflict. European peace was thought to be impossible. Yet that is what NATO and other institutions have helped achieve with American support. What would Asia look like right now had the United States not helped it to rebuild after the Second World War. Look at the way that American leadership allowed South Korea to go from a poor country--a dictatorship--to a vibrant democracy and one of the largest economies in the world. South Korea is now a net donor to foreign aid and a crucial ally for us in a region that includes an aggressive China and a belligerent North Korea. Japan has gone from a country devastated by war and not trusted by its neighbors to one of the most peaceful societies in the world. It has also become a net contributor to global security through its military and humanitarian assistance programs. Then there is the Middle East. Whether we should continue to play a role there is a question that weighs particularly heavily on the minds of many Americans. I understand the doubts and frustrations. We have been involved in the region for decades. Nothing seems to be getting better, and despite our attempts to help, we watch on television as some celebrate our tragedies and burn our flag in the Arab streets. It is true that we cannot solve all of the region's problems, but we have an interest in what happens there, nonetheless. That interest is served by our involvement, not by our withdrawal. ISIS arose, in the first place, because of the political instability that exists in both Syria and Iraq, and that instability was created in part because President Obama withdrew or withheld American leadership at crucial moments. Failing to lead costs us more in the long-term than it saves us in the short-term, and we will continue to pay a steep price each time we fail to lead in the future. There are complex considerations to make regarding our engagement in every region, but I believe a world without sustained American engagement is not a world any of us want to live in. This idea shared by prominent voices in both parties--that America is such a weak nation that we cannot afford to be engaged in the world--is one of the biggest lies ever told to the American people. Just because our government leaders are weak does not mean America is weak. No American wants to live in a world where Vladimir Putin sets the agenda or ISIS holds us hostage to their demands. Yet this is the world we are heading toward as political leaders continue to embrace America's decline. Defense spending is currently at roughly 3.3 percent of our budget, compared to 14 percent at the height of the Korean war. Our Army is on track to be at pre-World War II levels. Our Navy is already at pre- World War I levels, and our Air Force has the smallest and oldest combat force in its history. These are the results of specific policy choices made by politicians right here. It is no accident that the result has been more conflict around the world and less American influence. I saw firsthand on a recent trip to Iraq how our men and women in uniform around the world are doing their best to keep us safe with limited resources. We put them in an untenable position. They are asked to maintain our global commitments, fight ISIS and other terrorist groups, and deter countries such as Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China. They and our country deserve better. ``Spend less abroad so we can spend more at home'' has become a common refrain among leaders in both parties. It is used to excuse cuts to the military and our presence around the world. The truth is that the defense budget is not the primary driver of our debt. It is our entitlement programs. Every time we try to cut a dollar from our military, it seems to cost us several more just to make up for it. In addition to investing in our strength, we must apply that strength in a way that respects our values and supports our economic interests. Americans deserve a foreign policy we can be proud of. But for the last 8 years, we have had a Commander in Chief who praises and appeases dictators to promote the illusion of peace. Some in my party have now adopted a similar approach. They may claim to represent different ideas, but both emanate from the same notion--that Americans are too tired, that America is too weak, and that we are too much like the rest of the world to stand up to tyrants, so we should just cut deals with them instead. This is not only morally wrong, but it is contrary to our interests. Whenever our foreign policy becomes unhinged from its moral purpose, it weakens global stability and it forms cracks in our national resolve. But whenever freedom and human rights spread, partners for our Nation are born. We must restore America's willingness to state boldly what we stand for and why. Just as Reagan never flinched in his criticisms of the Soviet Union, we must not shy away from demanding that China allow true freedom for its 1.3 billion people or boldly stating that Vladimir Putin is a corrupt thug. Nor should we hesitate in calling the source of atrocities in the Middle East by its real name--radical Islam. We should always stand with Israel, and we should not abandon the cause of freedom in our own hemisphere and allow cruel and immoral dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela to be absolved of their crimes. The world needs America's moral and military strength just as much as our people and our economy do. No other nation can deter global conflict by its presence alone. No other nation can offer the security and benevolence that [[Page S3021]] America can. No other Nation can be trusted to defend peace and advance liberty. America cannot avoid its role as a global leader. But we also know America cannot be tasked with protecting the world on its own. It will take an international order of free nations with free economies to do so. We must work with like-minded allies whenever possible and encourage them to do their part, but no other nation has the ability to organize or lead such a coalition if we fail to do so. That is why I will continue to make the case for an engaged America, no matter who becomes our next President, no matter how the political winds may blow. Our safety and our prosperity depend on it. The ideal of America depends on it. That was true last century, and it is even more so today. Madam President, with that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING Officer. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Then, like now, our people benefitted tremendously from our status in the world, even though our engagement was disproportional to that of other nations; in fact, we benefitted precisely because our engagement was disproportional to that of other nations. International engagement has never been a business deal. International engagement is not a transaction in which we give something tangible and receive something tangible in return. America has more to give to the nations we are helping, and that is one of the reasons why we have a responsibility to lead. It is written in the Bible: ``From everyone who has been given much, much will be required.'' But our leadership ends up paying dividends for the entire world, and especially for the American people. First of all, American workers and families benefit economically. International affairs have a bigger impact on the financial well-being of our people today than ever before. In our global economy, someone on the other side of the planet can now buy a product from an American with the tap of a finger. But when nations or entire regions are torn apart by war and by oppression, they become closed off, and economic growth in our own country is restricted as a result. If America were to fail to protect the openness of international waters, global shipping would be threatened and prices would rise for consumers on virtually everything. Similarly, if space and cyber space became threatened or restricted, global communications and commerce would suffer as well. Americans also see real benefits in terms of our safety at home and around the world. Without American leadership, regional order tends to break down, and then instability spreads. This opens up vacuums that are filled up by radicals, and those radicals always--irrespective of what we are doing or what we are not doing--target America, and they do so either to bolster their own prestige or for ideological reasons or often for both. As President Obama has found, leaving the Middle East doesn't mean terrorists stop trying to kill Americans. Our families, our homeland, and our men and women in uniform are less safe when America disengages from the world. We also benefit geopolitically when we help other nations. Think what Europe would look like if it had not been for America's moral and strategic leadership during the Cold War. Europe still faces many challenges today, mainly because of our neglect of the crisis in Syria, but for centuries prior, Europe was driven by conflict. European peace was thought to be impossible. Yet that is what NATO and other institutions have helped achieve with American support. What would Asia look like right now had the United States not helped it to rebuild after the Second World War. Look at the way that American leadership allowed South Korea to go from a poor country--a dictatorship--to a vibrant democracy and one of the largest economies in the world. South Korea is now a net donor to foreign aid and a crucial ally for us in a region that includes an aggressive China and a belligerent North Korea. Japan has gone from a country devastated by war and not trusted by its neighbors to one of the most peaceful societies in the world. It has also become a net contributor to global security through its military and humanitarian assistance programs. Then there is the Middle East. Whether we should continue to play a role there is a question that weighs particularly heavily on the minds of many Americans. I understand the doubts and frustrations. We have been involved in the region for decades. Nothing seems to be getting better, and despite our attempts to help, we watch on television as some celebrate our tragedies and burn our flag in the Arab streets. It is true that we cannot solve all of the region's problems, but we have an interest in what happens there, nonetheless. That interest is served by our involvement, not by our withdrawal. ISIS arose, in the first place, because of the political instability that exists in both Syria and Iraq, and that instability was created in part because President Obama withdrew or withheld American leadership at crucial moments. Failing to lead costs us more in the long-term than it saves us in the short-term, and we will continue to pay a steep price each time we fail to lead in the future. There are complex considerations to make regarding our engagement in every region, but I believe a world without sustained American engagement is not a world any of us want to live in. This idea shared by prominent voices in both parties--that America is such a weak nation that we cannot afford to be engaged in the world--is one of the biggest lies ever told to the American people. Just because our government leaders are weak does not mean America is weak. No American wants to live in a world where Vladimir Putin sets the agenda or ISIS holds us hostage to their demands. Yet this is the world we are heading toward as political leaders continue to embrace America's decline. Defense spending is currently at roughly 3.3 percent of our budget, compared to 14 percent at the height of the Korean war. Our Army is on track to be at pre-World War II levels. Our Navy is already at pre- World War I levels, and our Air Force has the smallest and oldest combat force in its history. These are the results of specific policy choices made by politicians right here. It is no accident that the result has been more conflict around the world and less American influence. I saw firsthand on a recent trip to Iraq how our men and women in uniform around the world are doing their best to keep us safe with limited resources. We put them in an untenable position. They are asked to maintain our global commitments, fight ISIS and other terrorist groups, and deter countries such as Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China. They and our country deserve better. ``Spend less abroad so we can spend more at home'' has become a common refrain among leaders in both parties. It is used to excuse cuts to the military and our presence around the world. The truth is that the defense budget is not the primary driver of our debt. It is our entitlement programs. Every time we try to cut a dollar from our military, it seems to cost us several more just to make up for it. In addition to investing in our strength, we must apply that strength in a way that respects our values and supports our economic interests. Americans deserve a foreign policy we can be proud of. But for the last 8 years, we have had a Commander in Chief who praises and appeases dictators to promote the illusion of peace. Some in my party have now adopted a similar approach. They may claim to represent different ideas, but both emanate from the same notion--that Americans are too tired, that America is too weak, and that we are too much like the rest of the world to stand up to tyrants, so we should just cut deals with them instead. This is not only morally wrong, but it is contrary to our interests. Whenever our foreign policy becomes unhinged from its moral purpose, it weakens global stability and it forms cracks in our national resolve. But whenever freedom and human rights spread, partners for our Nation are born. We must restore America's willingness to state boldly what we stand for and why. Just as Reagan never flinched in his criticisms of the Soviet Union, we must not shy away from demanding that China allow true freedom for its 1.3 billion people or boldly stating that Vladimir Putin is a corrupt thug. Nor should we hesitate in calling the source of atrocities in the Middle East by its real name--radical Islam. We should always stand with Israel, and we should not abandon the cause of freedom in our own hemisphere and allow cruel and immoral dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela to be absolved of their crimes. The world needs America's moral and military strength just as much as our people and our economy do. No other nation can deter global conflict by its presence alone. No other nation can offer the security and benevolence that [[Page S3021]] America can. No other Nation can be trusted to defend peace and advance liberty. America cannot avoid its role as a global leader. But we also know America cannot be tasked with protecting the world on its own. It will take an international order of free nations with free economies to do so. We must work with like-minded allies whenever possible and encourage them to do their part, but no other nation has the ability to organize or lead such a coalition if we fail to do so. That is why I will continue to make the case for an engaged America, no matter who becomes our next President, no matter how the political winds may blow. Our safety and our prosperity depend on it. The ideal of America depends on it. That was true last century, and it is even more so today. Madam President, with that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING Officer. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_17.csv,10632,10632,10699,"[congressional record volume 162, number 80 (thursday, may 19, 2016)] [senate] [pages s3019-s3021] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] international engagement mr. rubio. madam president, there is an ongoing debate in our politics today about the value of leadership around the world in the 21st century. there is a view that seems to be gaining traction and favor--that our international engagement is one-sided, that our allies are free riders, that we contribute too much and get too little in return, and so why should we be involved in the world? these voices exist in both parties, and i would like to answer them today. i want to start by looking back at the last century, when the world emerged from the death and destruction of the second world war. the united states could have decided after that war to wall ourselves off-- that after the loss of so many of our best and brightest, we had already paid enough for peace. instead, our country became the driving force behind international [[page s3020]] order. we forged a series of strong alliances, led with moral clarity, and positioned our military strength strategically around the world. in doing so, the american people benefitted immensely as we helped to stave off the threat of another global conflict and oversaw decades of economic growth and the spread of democracy and freedom around the world. then, like now, our people benefitted tremendously from our status in

CREC-2016-05-19-pt1-PgS3021,CREC-2016-05-19,114,"TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS BILLS","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3021-S3022] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS BILLS Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am pleased that today the Senate passed two annual spending bills--Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs--and approved funding to combat the Zika virus. Senators Collins, Reed, Kirk, and Tester worked hard to craft good, bipartisan bills with no ideological, partisan policy riders. They have reminded us of the way we should do business here in the Senate. I was proud to support both bills when they were considered by the Appropriations Committee in recent weeks and proud to support them again today. I am pleased that the bill includes long-overdue funding to fight Zika. The bill does not provide the full amount of funding that our health and infectious disease experts say they need, but it does provide a good down payment of $1.1 billion. We must do more, and we must do it now, in order to protect pregnant women nationwide. This bill builds on the surface transportation bill, the FAST Act, that Congress passed last year that provides funding over 5 years for rail and highway infrastructure. Illinois rail lines are at the center of our national transportation network. In 2014, 5 million people boarded or exited trains in Illinois, giving residents a safe, affordable option when traveling. The bill supports rail options by providing strong funding for Amtrak, including $1.42 billion for the national network. It increases funding for TIGER and Core Capacity Capital Investment Grants, which supports transportation improvement projects across Illinois like the CTA's Red Purple Modernization project to provide more commuter passenger rail options to people in Chicago. The bill also funds important rail safety programs across the country. First-time funding for passenger rail grant programs authorized in the FAST Act will address gaps in supporting and growing our nation's passenger rail infrastructure. Rail line relocation and grade crossing enhancements will reduce accidents and improve passenger safety in Illinois and around the country. Nearly 1.1 million barrels of crude oil are hauled on our nation's railroads every day. Last year's derailment in Galena, IL, highlights the need to invest in rail safety. The bill continues funding for Positive Train Control programs and supports the Safe Transport of Energy Products Program. There is always more work to be done. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, America scores a D in investment in roads, transit, and aviation and a C-plus in rail. This bill is a good start. This bill not only invests in our transportation infrastructure, but it also invests in our housing infrastructure. I want to thank Senators Collins and Reed again for their efforts to address lead-based paint hazards in our Nation's low-income housing. Since Flint, we have learned that exposure to lead, be it through our drinking water or paint in our homes, is still a major problem in communities across Illinois and the country. We have also learned that, when government shortchanges our infrastructure because of opposition to commonsense protections and draconian spending cuts, families suffer the consequences. In the case of Flint, local and State government was the problem, and now, it, along with Federal Government, have to be part of the solution. And the provisions in this bill can help us do that. This bill requires HUD to update its standards to the CDC's blood level standard, which is currently four times the CDC level. It improves tenant awareness and education of the lead-based paint hazards. And it provides a modest increase in funding for the identification and remediation of lead-based hazards found in federally assisted housing. These are all good things, and they will go a long way in addressing the government's abysmal and embarrassing record in dealing with this problem, which has led to far too many children living in federally subsidized housing suffering from lead poisoning, including one family in Chicago. Lanice Walker's 4-year-old daughter was diagnosed with lead poisoning less than 5 months after her and her family moved into a home subsidized by a Housing Choice Voucher. But Lanice Walker was not able to move without the risk of losing her voucher because her daughter's blood lead level, which was two times the CDC level, didn't meet the standards under HUD regulations. It wasn't until all nine of her children had elevated blood levels and legal advocates intervened on her behalf before she was granted permission to move. This is unacceptable, and we must do more to protect children in affordable housing before they become poisoned by lead. We must ensure that lead-based paint hazards are properly identified before a family moves into a unit. We must update all outdated lead regulations using the most recent science and enforce them. And we must adequately fund programs designed to identify and eliminate lead paint hazards. I hope that our efforts today are just the beginning of our recommitment to addressing our lead epidemic. The Senate also approved the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill, which provides a $3.1 billion increase above fiscal year 2016 enacted levels. This funding will support a wide variety of projects to ensure the military readiness and quality of life on military bases within the United States and around the world. It provides $70 million for Arlington National Cemetery to ensure that the final resting place for our servicemembers is well maintained. The bill ensures that we provide for our Nation's veterans and their families, those who have sacrificed so much over the years and deserve our gratitude. The Veterans Benefits Administration will receive $2.8 billion more than last year to help the VA modernize its claims processing as well as help reduce and eliminate backlogs. Forcing veterans to wait months and sometimes years to get the benefits they deserve is unacceptable. The bill increases funding for critical programs and emerging needs, including hepatitis C treatment, whistleblower protection, as well as family caregiver support. For years, I have championed the caregivers program in Congress, so I am pleased that this program is a priority in this bill. Hundreds of veterans and their caregivers in Illinois and more than 23,000 nationwide participate in this program, with much success. The bill increases medical and prosthetic research funding by $44 million compared to fiscal year 2016, at $675 million. These funds are critical to continuing our national commitment [[Page S3022]] to medical research and will help our veterans that return home with both the physical and mental wounds of war. The number of veterans using VA services is dramatically increasing as the population ages. The VA provides more care for veterans now than ever before, and more of these veterans and their families have increasingly critical needs. I would also like to take a moment to address an amendment I offered that was included as part of a managers package. My amendment directs the Secretary of the VA to spend at least $21 million to fill critical staffing shortages in VA leadership at networks, medical centers, and health care systems across the country. At least three dozen key VA leadership positions are currently filled by acting or interim directors, sometimes for years at a time. In my home State of Illinois, for example, Hines VA Hospital has not had a permanent director since 2014. Permanently assigned leadership that is capable of overseeing and managing networks and medical centers is critical to delivering high quality care to our Nation's veterans in a timely fashion, especially at a time when the VA faces a number of challenges. This funding will help the VA prioritize filling these key positions, as well as address staffing shortages in other management and clinical positions, including in rural and underserved areas. It is my hope that this funding will allow the VA to quickly fill these important positions within the Department. I am glad to say that overall, moving this bill is good for our Nation's military and their families. I hope today's action by the Senate is another step in the direction of passing all 12 appropriations bills, all without ideological riders. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to continue to work with us in a bipartisan manner to pass additional appropriations bills without ideological riders. I would also like to urge my colleagues to quickly send these funding measures to the President. Zika funding is needed now. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3021-S3022] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS BILLS Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I am pleased that today the Senate passed two annual spending bills--Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs--and approved funding to combat the Zika virus. Senators Collins, Reed, Kirk, and Tester worked hard to craft good, bipartisan bills with no ideological, partisan policy riders. They have reminded us of the way we should do business here in the Senate. I was proud to support both bills when they were considered by the Appropriations Committee in recent weeks and proud to support them again today. I am pleased that the bill includes long-overdue funding to fight Zika. The bill does not provide the full amount of funding that our health and infectious disease experts say they need, but it does provide a good down payment of $1.1 billion. We must do more, and we must do it now, in order to protect pregnant women nationwide. This bill builds on the surface transportation bill, the FAST Act, that Congress passed last year that provides funding over 5 years for rail and highway infrastructure. Illinois rail lines are at the center of our national transportation network. In 2014, 5 million people boarded or exited trains in Illinois, giving residents a safe, affordable option when traveling. The bill supports rail options by providing strong funding for Amtrak, including $1.42 billion for the national network. It increases funding for TIGER and Core Capacity Capital Investment Grants, which supports transportation improvement projects across Illinois like the CTA's Red Purple Modernization project to provide more commuter passenger rail options to people in Chicago. The bill also funds important rail safety programs across the country. First-time funding for passenger rail grant programs authorized in the FAST Act will address gaps in supporting and growing our nation's passenger rail infrastructure. Rail line relocation and grade crossing enhancements will reduce accidents and improve passenger safety in Illinois and around the country. Nearly 1.1 million barrels of crude oil are hauled on our nation's railroads every day. Last year's derailment in Galena, IL, highlights the need to invest in rail safety. The bill continues funding for Positive Train Control programs and supports the Safe Transport of Energy Products Program. There is always more work to be done. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, America scores a D in investment in roads, transit, and aviation and a C-plus in rail. This bill is a good start. This bill not only invests in our transportation infrastructure, but it also invests in our housing infrastructure. I want to thank Senators Collins and Reed again for their efforts to address lead-based paint hazards in our Nation's low-income housing. Since Flint, we have learned that exposure to lead, be it through our drinking water or paint in our homes, is still a major problem in communities across Illinois and the country. We have also learned that, when government shortchanges our infrastructure because of opposition to commonsense protections and draconian spending cuts, families suffer the consequences. In the case of Flint, local and State government was the problem, and now, it, along with Federal Government, have to be part of the solution. And the provisions in this bill can help us do that. This bill requires HUD to update its standards to the CDC's blood level standard, which is currently four times the CDC level. It improves tenant awareness and education of the lead-based paint hazards. And it provides a modest increase in funding for the identification and remediation of lead-based hazards found in federally assisted housing. These are all good things, and they will go a long way in addressing the government's abysmal and embarrassing record in dealing with this problem, which has led to far too many children living in federally subsidized housing suffering from lead poisoning, including one family in Chicago. Lanice Walker's 4-year-old daughter was diagnosed with lead poisoning less than 5 months after her and her family moved into a home subsidized by a Housing Choice Voucher. But Lanice Walker was not able to move without the risk of losing her voucher because her daughter's blood lead level, which was two times the CDC level, didn't meet the standards under HUD regulations. It wasn't until all nine of her children had elevated blood levels and legal advocates intervened on her behalf before she was granted permission to move. This is unacceptable, and we must do more to protect children in affordable housing before they become poisoned by lead. We must ensure that lead-based paint hazards are properly identified before a family moves into a unit. We must update all outdated lead regulations using the most recent science and enforce them. And we must adequately fund programs designed to identify and eliminate lead paint hazards. I hope that our efforts today are just the beginning of our recommitment to addressing our lead epidemic. The Senate also approved the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill, which provides a $3.1 billion increase above fiscal year 2016 enacted levels. This funding will support a wide variety of projects to ensure the military readiness and quality of life on military bases within the United States and around the world. It provides $70 million for Arlington National Cemetery to ensure that the final resting place for our servicemembers is well maintained. The bill ensures that we provide for our Nation's veterans and their families, those who have sacrificed so much over the years and deserve our gratitude. The Veterans Benefits Administration will receive $2.8 billion more than last year to help the VA modernize its claims processing as well as help reduce and eliminate backlogs. Forcing veterans to wait months and sometimes years to get the benefits they deserve is unacceptable. The bill increases funding for critical programs and emerging needs, including hepatitis C treatment, whistleblower protection, as well as family caregiver support. For years, I have championed the caregivers program in Congress, so I am pleased that this program is a priority in this bill. Hundreds of veterans and their caregivers in Illinois and more than 23,000 nationwide participate in this program, with much success. The bill increases medical and prosthetic research funding by $44 million compared to fiscal year 2016, at $675 million. These funds are critical to continuing our national commitment [[Page S3022]] to medical research and will help our veterans that return home with both the physical and mental wounds of war. The number of veterans using VA services is dramatically increasing as the population ages. The VA provides more care for veterans now than ever before, and more of these veterans and their families have increasingly critical needs. I would also like to take a moment to address an amendment I offered that was included as part of a managers package. My amendment directs the Secretary of the VA to spend at least $21 million to fill critical staffing shortages in VA leadership at networks, medical centers, and health care systems across the country. At least three dozen key VA leadership positions are currently filled by acting or interim directors, sometimes for years at a time. In my home State of Illinois, for example, Hines VA Hospital has not had a permanent director since 2014. Permanently assigned leadership that is capable of overseeing and managing networks and medical centers is critical to delivering high quality care to our Nation's veterans in a timely fashion, especially at a time when the VA faces a number of challenges. This funding will help the VA prioritize filling these key positions, as well as address staffing shortages in other management and clinical positions, including in rural and underserved areas. It is my hope that this funding will allow the VA to quickly fill these important positions within the Department. I am glad to say that overall, moving this bill is good for our Nation's military and their families. I hope today's action by the Senate is another step in the direction of passing all 12 appropriations bills, all without ideological riders. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to continue to work with us in a bipartisan manner to pass additional appropriations bills without ideological riders. I would also like to urge my colleagues to quickly send these funding measures to the President. Zika funding is needed now. ____________________",package_114_17.csv,8933,8933,9000,"[congressional record volume 162, number 80 (thursday, may 19, 2016)] [senate] [pages s3021-s3022] from the

CREC-2016-05-19-pt1-PgS3022,CREC-2016-05-19,114,NATIONAL POLICE WEEK,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3022-S3023] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL POLICE WEEK Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I wish to join Americans across the country in recognizing the immeasurable sacrifices made every day by the men and women of law enforcement. Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to help uphold the rule of law in America. Their professionalism and commitment to justice underpin so much of what has allowed this country to thrive for generations. In May 1962, President John F. Kennedy designated May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week containing May 15 as National Police Week. In that proclamation, President Kennedy stated, ``. . . from the beginning of this Nation, law enforcement officers have played an important role in safeguarding the rights and freedoms which are guaranteed by the Constitution and in protecting the lives and property of our citizens. . . .'' It is that twofold role of protecting both the constitutional and physical well-being of all Americans that earns law enforcement officers such a revered place in American society. In the 53 years since President Kennedy established this national celebration of law enforcement, much has changed in regards to the tactics and procedure for protecting essential rights and freedoms, as well as the nature of threats against personal property and the citizenry. What has not changed in the unwavering commitment to addressing these challenges by law enforcement agencies nationwide. My home State of Maryland is home to a close-knit, well-trained, and dedicated network of law enforcement agencies. Maryland is often called America in Miniature, and as such, Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers across Maryland are expected to be able to respond to an incredibly diverse set of situations. Being on the front lines of upholding the rule of law and protecting Americans from harm is not easy work. There is hardly a law enforcement officer in the United States who will not face the threat of bodily harm during their career. Unfortunately, due to the dangerous nature of police work, law enforcement officers across the country are killed on the job every year. Thus far in 2016, 35 law enforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty. Every one of those men and women left a family and grieving law enforcement agency. California, Colorado, and Maryland share the painful distinction of leading the Nation in law enforcement deaths in the line of duty. Three officers from each one of the aforementioned States were killed in the line of duty; in Maryland, all three were killed by gunfire. Senior Deputies Patrick Dailey and Mark Logsdon of the Harford County Sheriff's office and Officer Jacai Colson of the Prince George's County Police Department were all model officers who were tragically killed while protecting colleagues and civilians. All three of these men served communities in Maryland with distinction and contributed greatly to not only public safety but also to helping build strong and lasting relationships among law enforcement and the people they protect. Senior Deputies Dailey and Logsdon were both fathers and military veterans. Both served honorably with the Harford County Sheriff's Office. On Christmas Eve 2002, Deputy Dailey saved the life of a teenager traveling in an SUV that collided head-on with a cement mixing truck. Deputy Dailey, a number of fellow sheriffs, and two civilians emptied six fire extinguishers in an attempt to quell a fire that threatened to engulf the vehicle and the unresponsive driver. Using only their bare hands and batons, the group managed to free the driver seconds before the fire consumed the passenger compartment. The teen was able to thank his rescuers 3 months later at the Harford County Sheriff's Office Awards Banquet. Exactly 11 years before his death, Deputy Logsdon confronted a suicidal man who was armed with a loaded shotgun. In a display of great bravery and at great risk to himself, Deputy Logsdon managed to talk the man into surrendering his weapon. After the man was disarmed, Deputy Logsdon continued to help the man by transporting him to the hospital, where he received medical care. Officer Colson was an undercover narcotics agent. He had a dangerous job with zero margin for error. Officer Colson did not make errors. He was a 4-year veteran of the Prince George's Police Department. The commander of the Prince George's County Police Department's Narcotic Enforcement Division said of Colson, ``Not only is he good at his job, he's that guy that you wanted on your team.'' The President of the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 89 described Officer Colson as ``. . . always the first person here in the morning, ready to work and put in a full day's work.'' All three of these men could have done anything with their lives, and they chose to uphold the law. I am thankful that, for the many people they interacted with on a daily basis, these men embodied justice. I join Marylanders in mourning their loss. It is my hope that this National Police Week serves as a catalyst to communities and governments across the country to evaluate ways to better serve those who are sworn to protect and serve. Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, this evening, I want to honor our Nation's peace officers and to remember those who we have lost in the line of duty over the last year. Sunday was Peace Officers Memorial Day, a day set aside by President Kennedy in 1962 to honor those law enforcement officers who we have lost in the line of duty, a day that unfortunately has touched me personally, both in the past while serving as attorney general for North Dakota and tragically again earlier this year when the city of Fargo, ND, lost one of its finest in the line of duty. On the evening of Wednesday, February 10, 2016, Fargo Police Officer Jason Moszer answered the call to serve and protect for what would turn out to be the last time. He knew when he answered that call that he would confront an active-shooter situation, and he never hesitated in taking up a position to put himself between the shooter and the community he so very much loved. [[Page S3023]] Officer Moszer was struck down that evening, and his name will forever be etched in stone on the North Dakota's Peace Officer's Memorial that sits on the grounds of the State capitol in Bismarck. Through rain, sleet, and snow--extreme heat and cold--he will now stand alongside those other North Dakota officers who gave the ultimate sacrifice. They provide an unwavering example that, regardless of what conditions they face, our peace officers will stand steadfast regardless of what challenges they may face. National Police Week is very special to me. When I served as attorney general of North Dakota in the 1990s, I had the privilege to work directly with many of our State's law enforcement officers, from the highway patrol, to State and local officers, various Federal officers, and our tribal police. It was in that job that I truly began to appreciate the hard work and dedication of those officers who serve the people of North Dakota. These are some of the finest men and women I have ever met. During my time as a U.S. Senator, I have been able to see many old friends that continue their service and have met an entire new generation of law enforcement officers at the beginning of their careers. I can tell you that this new generation of law enforcement officers are not only up to the task, but will most certainly meet the same standards of excellence as their predecessors. I want to give special recognition to the Grand Forks Country Drug Task Force, a collection of State, local, and Federal law enforcement members who were honored earlier this year by the HIDTA program with an Outstanding Cooperative Effort award. This award came was the result of Operation Denial, a multiagency investigation into the international trafficking of fentanyl and other lethal drugs that led to multiple arrests and convictions in various States and countries. As we talk about the opioid abuse epidemic in the Senate and look to address this scourge on our communities, law enforcement officers are on the front lines tackling this challenge head-on. When honoring the service and sacrifice of our Nation's law enforcement officers, all too often there is a group of officers that don't garner the attention and praise that they deserve, our tribal law enforcement officers. Tribal officers work in some of the most challenging conditions, with incredible jurisdictional challenges and an embarrassing lack of resources, but they do not let that stand in the way of their dedication and passion to protect Indian Country. This evening, I want to extend special recognition and a personal thank you to all of our tribal law enforcement officers. I continue to work on behalf of our men and women in law enforcement, and all of us in Congress must continue to support our law enforcement officers with the resources and protections necessary for them to perform their duties. Last year, I was proud see a bill that I cosponsored, the Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu [Wen-Gin Lew] National Blue Alert Act, enacted into law. This bipartisan legislation established a national Blue Alert communications network to disseminate information about threats to officers. The law seeks to make sure that appropriate steps can be taken as quickly as possible to provide for an officer's safety. Just yesterday, the President signed two more bills into law that I supported and that will give law enforcement additional and sorely needed resources, the Transnational Drug Trafficking Act that will provide increased tools to go after foreign manufacturers or distributors of chemicals that will eventually end up in the U.S. as illicit drugs, and the Bulletproof Vest Reauthorization Act will extend for 5 years the matching grant program that helps law enforcement purchase lifesaving bulletproof vests. Just last week, another bill, the POLICE Act, passed out of the Judiciary Committee. This bill would make Federal grants available for law enforcement officers and medical personnel to help them better prepare for active-shooter situations, including training civilians on how to respond if confronted by an active shooter. Congress needs to swiftly pass this bill. And I am a proud cosponsor of Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley's resolution recognizing among other things, the dedication and sacrifice of all of our law enforcement officers and our debt of gratitude to each and every one of them. Thank you to all of our Nation's law enforcement officers for the jobs you do every day. I want to especially thank the law enforcement officers in my home State of North Dakota. I believe they are the finest collection of officers in the Nation. They are out there working day and night to keep our families safe, and just as they do for us, I will keep fighting for them every day. This Nation, our State, and our local communities owe our law enforcement officers a continuing debt of gratitude for their selfless actions to meet their sworn duty to protect and serve. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3022-S3023] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL POLICE WEEK Mr. CARDIN.

This bipartisan legislation established a national Blue Alert communications network to disseminate information about threats to officers. The law seeks to make sure that appropriate steps can be taken as quickly as possible to provide for an officer's safety. Just yesterday, the President signed two more bills into law that I supported and that will give law enforcement additional and sorely needed resources, the Transnational Drug Trafficking Act that will provide increased tools to go after foreign manufacturers or distributors of chemicals that will eventually end up in the U.S. as illicit drugs, and the Bulletproof Vest Reauthorization Act will extend for 5 years the matching grant program that helps law enforcement purchase lifesaving bulletproof vests. Just last week, another bill, the POLICE Act, passed out of the Judiciary Committee. This bill would make Federal grants available for law enforcement officers and medical personnel to help them better prepare for active-shooter situations, including training civilians on how to respond if confronted by an active shooter. Congress needs to swiftly pass this bill. And I am a proud cosponsor of Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley's resolution recognizing among other things, the dedication and sacrifice of all of our law enforcement officers and our debt of gratitude to each and every one of them. Thank you to all of our Nation's law enforcement officers for the jobs you do every day. I want to especially thank the law enforcement officers in my home State of North Dakota. I believe they are the finest collection of officers in the Nation. They are out there working day and night to keep our families safe, and just as they do for us, I will keep fighting for them every day. This Nation, our State, and our local communities owe our law enforcement officers a continuing debt of gratitude for their selfless actions to meet their sworn duty to protect and serve. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3022-S3023] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL POLICE WEEK Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I wish to join Americans across the country in recognizing the immeasurable sacrifices made every day by the men and women of law enforcement. Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to help uphold the rule of law in America. Their professionalism and commitment to justice underpin so much of what has allowed this country to thrive for generations. In May 1962, President John F. Kennedy designated May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week containing May 15 as National Police Week. In that proclamation, President Kennedy stated, ``. . . from the beginning of this Nation, law enforcement officers have played an important role in safeguarding the rights and freedoms which are guaranteed by the Constitution and in protecting the lives and property of our citizens. . . .'' It is that twofold role of protecting both the constitutional and physical well-being of all Americans that earns law enforcement officers such a revered place in American society. In the 53 years since President Kennedy established this national celebration of law enforcement, much has changed in regards to the tactics and procedure for protecting essential rights and freedoms, as well as the nature of threats against personal property and the citizenry. What has not changed in the unwavering commitment to addressing these challenges by law enforcement agencies nationwide. My home State of Maryland is home to a close-knit, well-trained, and dedicated network of law enforcement agencies. Maryland is often called America in Miniature, and as such, Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers across Maryland are expected to be able to respond to an incredibly diverse set of situations. Being on the front lines of upholding the rule of law and protecting Americans from harm is not easy work. There is hardly a law enforcement officer in the United States who will not face the threat of bodily harm during their career. Unfortunately, due to the dangerous nature of police work, law enforcement officers across the country are killed on the job every year. Thus far in 2016, 35 law enforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty. Every one of those men and women left a family and grieving law enforcement agency. California, Colorado, and Maryland share the painful distinction of leading the Nation in law enforcement deaths in the line of duty. Three officers from each one of the aforementioned States were killed in the line of duty; in Maryland, all three were killed by gunfire. Senior Deputies Patrick Dailey and Mark Logsdon of the Harford County Sheriff's office and Officer Jacai Colson of the Prince George's County Police Department were all model officers who were tragically killed while protecting colleagues and civilians. All three of these men served communities in Maryland with distinction and contributed greatly to not only public safety but also to helping build strong and lasting relationships among law enforcement and the people they protect. Senior Deputies Dailey and Logsdon were both fathers and military veterans. Both served honorably with the Harford County Sheriff's Office. On Christmas Eve 2002, Deputy Dailey saved the life of a teenager traveling in an SUV that collided head-on with a cement mixing truck. Deputy Dailey, a number of fellow sheriffs, and two civilians emptied six fire extinguishers in an attempt to quell a fire that threatened to engulf the vehicle and the unresponsive driver. Using only their bare hands and batons, the group managed to free the driver seconds before the fire consumed the passenger compartment. The teen was able to thank his rescuers 3 months later at the Harford County Sheriff's Office Awards Banquet. Exactly 11 years before his death, Deputy Logsdon confronted a suicidal man who was armed with a loaded shotgun. In a display of great bravery and at great risk to himself, Deputy Logsdon managed to talk the man into surrendering his weapon. After the man was disarmed, Deputy Logsdon continued to help the man by transporting him to the hospital, where he received medical care. Officer Colson was an undercover narcotics agent. He had a dangerous job with zero margin for error. Officer Colson did not make errors. He was a 4-year veteran of the Prince George's Police Department. The commander of the Prince George's County Police Department's Narcotic Enforcement Division said of Colson, ``Not only is he good at his job, he's that guy that you wanted on your team.'' The President of the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 89 described Officer Colson as ``. . . always the first person here in the morning, ready to work and put in a full day's work.'' All three of these men could have done anything with their lives, and they chose to uphold the law. I am thankful that, for the many people they interacted with on a daily basis, these men embodied justice. I join Marylanders in mourning their loss. It is my hope that this National Police Week serves as a catalyst to communities and governments across the country to evaluate ways to better serve those who are sworn to protect and serve. Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, this evening, I want to honor our Nation's peace officers and to remember those who we have lost in the line of duty over the last year. Sunday was Peace Officers Memorial Day, a day set aside by President Kennedy in 1962 to honor those law enforcement officers who we have lost in the line of duty, a day that unfortunately has touched me personally, both in the past while serving as attorney general for North Dakota and tragically again earlier this year when the city of Fargo, ND, lost one of its finest in the line of duty. On the evening of Wednesday, February 10, 2016, Fargo Police Officer Jason Moszer answered the call to serve and protect for what would turn out to be the last time. He knew when he answered that call that he would confront an active-shooter situation, and he never hesitated in taking up a position to put himself between the shooter and the community he so very much loved. [[Page S3023]] Officer Moszer was struck down that evening, and his name will forever be etched in stone on the North Dakota's Peace Officer's Memorial that sits on the grounds of the State capitol in Bismarck. Through rain, sleet, and snow--extreme heat and cold--he will now stand alongside those other North Dakota officers who gave the ultimate sacrifice. They provide an unwavering example that, regardless of what conditions they face, our peace officers will stand steadfast regardless of what challenges they may face. National Police Week is very special to me. When I served as attorney general of North Dakota in the 1990s, I had the privilege to work directly with many of our State's law enforcement officers, from the highway patrol, to State and local officers, various Federal officers, and our tribal police. It was in that job that I truly began to appreciate the hard work and dedication of those officers who serve the people of North Dakota. These are some of the finest men and women I have ever met. During my time as a U.S. Senator, I have been able to see many old friends that continue their service and have met an entire new generation of law enforcement officers at the beginning of their careers. I can tell you that this new generation of law enforcement officers are not only up to the task, but will most certainly meet the same standards of excellence as their predecessors. I want to give special recognition to the Grand Forks Country Drug Task Force, a collection of State, local, and Federal law enforcement members who were honored earlier this year by the HIDTA program with an Outstanding Cooperative Effort award. This award came was the result of Operation Denial, a multiagency investigation into the international trafficking of fentanyl and other lethal drugs that led to multiple arrests and convictions in various States and countries. As we talk about the opioid abuse epidemic in the Senate and look to address this scourge on our communities, law enforcement officers are on the front lines tackling this challenge head-on. When honoring the service and sacrifice of our Nation's law enforcement officers, all too often there is a group of officers that don't garner the attention and praise that they deserve, our tribal law enforcement officers. Tribal officers work in some of the most challenging conditions, with incredible jurisdictional challenges and an embarrassing lack of resources, but they do not let that stand in the way of their dedication and passion to protect Indian Country. This evening, I want to extend special recognition and a personal thank you to all of our tribal law enforcement officers. I continue to work on behalf of our men and women in law enforcement, and all of us in Congress must continue to support our law enforcement officers with the resources and protections necessary for them to perform their duties. Last year, I was proud see a bill that I cosponsored, the Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu [Wen-Gin Lew] National Blue Alert Act, enacted into law. This bipartisan legislation established a national Blue Alert communications network to disseminate information about threats to officers.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I appreciate seeing the Presiding Officer in the chair and having a ``Corey'' represented and presiding over the U.S. Senate. I rise today to speak against an amendment now pending to this bill that would block a rule that seeks to fulfill the promise of the Fair Housing Act. This issue is very deeply personal to me and one that really has defined my own personal history. I would like to start by telling a story. In 1969, just 1 year after the passage of the Fair Housing Act, a couple here in Washington, DC, married with two boys, decided to move to New Jersey. In New Jersey, they encountered a lot of a practice called real estate steering, where Black couples were steered away from certain neighborhoods. Realizing they were being steered away from White neighborhoods, they grew frustrated, and they sought the help of the fair housing council. They set up an elaborate sting operation where my parents would go look at a home--or this couple would go look at a home--and they would then be followed by a White couple. The couple was told the house was sold or it was not for sale. The White couple would then appear and find out if that was, indeed, true. Most often for this couple from Washington, DC, yes, they would find out the house was still for sale. Eventually this couple found a house they loved in a small town called Harrington Park, NJ, but they were told that the house was not for sale. They were told the house had been pulled off the market or sold. They left. Then the White couple came behind them. Lo and behold, the house had not been sold or was not pulled off the market. The White couple pretended that they loved the house as the Black couple did and put a bid on the house. The bid was accepted. On the day of the closing, instead of the White couple showing up, the African-American gentleman from the Black couple and a volunteer lawyer came to confront the real estate agent. The real estate agent was so upset that he stood up and punched the lawyer representing the Black couple and sicced his dog on the African-American man. Yet the law was on their side. The fair housing law of the United States of America, the law of the Federal Government, was on their side. Eventually, that Black couple and their two kids moved into that home in Harrington Park, NJ. That was 1969. It was the year I was born, and that couple was my parents, Cary and Carolyn Booker. That is my origin story. Legislation that this body passed empowered my family to move into the home of their dreams in an all-White neighborhood with incredibly good schools that I went through from K-12. I am the beneficiary of work this body did to ensure that our American values are preserved, our values of inclusion and integration, to make sure fair housing is the law of the land. That work gave me my start in life. The activism of local activists, combined with the law of the land as passed by us, defined my path. After decades of struggle in communities across the country, we have largely been successful in banning overt housing discrimination. We [[Page S3005]] should be proud of our work. But legislation that we passed should not become a relic of history. It is not something for us to turn and admire. We all know on many issues the cause of freedom and the cause of justice necessitate constant vigilance. So I rise today with the knowledge that while major pieces of civil rights legislation like the Fair Housing Act have had a significant impact on millions of Americans--White, Black, Latino, Asian, disabled--this has had a full impact. We still have work to do to continue that vigilance to make sure that those values, those ideals, and the law of the land are made real for families. Unfortunately, for nearly 50 years there has not been real guidance, direction, or tools to help local officials achieve the goals of the Fair Housing Act, which are integrated housing, fair housing, equal access. In 2010, in fact, the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, failed to properly administer oversight obligations under the Fair Housing Act and failed to monitor its guarantees for compliance with the law. In 2013, HUD proposed affirmatively furthering fair housing, a new rule that would seek to fulfill the promise of the Fair Housing Act and eliminate a lot of the historic patterns of segregation that still go on in America today. The vision for the rule is to institute a data- driven analysis of localities and to develop Federal grant programs for housing and economic inclusion. When I was mayor, people came to me with passions and accusations and the like. I used to always say: In God we trust, but, everybody else, bring me data. It is important to look at the numbers to know what really is going on. So HUD brought about this idea of making sure we have that data--not in a rushed process. The administration engaged in a diligent 2-year rulemaking process with public inclusion, participation from others, and lots of public comment periods. They finalized that rule in July 2015. It is unfortunate that one of my dear colleagues--somebody whom I value very much because we do a lot of work across the aisle--has introduced an amendment that would block this rule's implementation, and I must respectfully disagree with the intent of this amendment. The Fair Housing Act and, really, the entirety of the Civil Rights Act were meant, again, to be real today, not just relics of yesterday. They were meant to be guideposts and standards by which we hold ourselves accountable for the values we put forth. The affirmatively further fair housing rule is a measure of accountability for HUD and for ourselves. You cannot change what you cannot measure. Let me say that again. I learned this as a manager: If you can't measure it, you can't change it or affect it. The rule will arm communities most in need with knowledge and numbers so they can make intelligent local decisions and best apply their resources. It is what everyone who has to manage something needs: accurate data. It will improve the access to quality data on local demographics and streamline the process for analyzing local fair housing impediments, helping grantees establish their own local fair housing priorities. This rule does not interfere with local zoning or housing laws, and it prevents further taxpayer dollars from being used to discriminate. Every stakeholder--every one of us--is afforded an opportunity to comment on the rule that HUD made, and, as a former local leader, it empowers people at the localities to do justice by their communities. This is a balanced and a measured rule, and it takes up the cause of the work to make our country more and more just. I know personally that so much of the character of our country comes from the values we have as a whole. There are rare times in our history where this body is called upon to affirm those values. This body's history--the noble history of this body--is something I have benefited from personally around fair housing. Now we have more tools necessary, with big data and analysis, to more effectively and affirmatively assert our values and ensure injustice is not being done. I want to make sure that we defeat this amendment for those reasons. I believe and know the values of my colleague who proposed this. I do not think it achieves the end that we want to see by disempowering people to try to help families like mine. I was a child in DC moving to New Jersey and found justice--found a pathway toward integration. Indeed, I doubt I would be here right now if it weren't for the laws of our land. I hope we can defeat this amendment and ensure that our Nation becomes more fair and more just and that more families like mine can find the America we hail when we pledge allegiance to the flag and say we are a Nation of liberty and justice for all. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum calls be charged equally, fairly--like fair housing--fairly, to both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized. The Appropriations Process Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senators have been working diligently this week, continuing our efforts to advance American priorities and responsibly fund important programs through the appropriations process. We have made good progress so far. The Senate already passed one funding bill by a broad majority at a record early time. Another Appropriations subcommittee approved its own funding bill just the other day, and it is my hope that we will be able to move two more funding measures across the finish line very shortly. With continued work and cooperation, we can do just that. The two measures before us are the result of hard work, negotiation, and compromise. They are the product of strong leadership by Senators Collins and Kirk, and they are the culmination of a good deal of input from both sides of the aisle. Here is what we know these bills can achieve: The transportation and housing infrastructure appropriations bill will invest in our transportation systems and help ensure safety and efficiency. The veterans and military construction funding bill will help improve care for veterans and increase oversight and accountability efforts at the VA. The legislation before us will also include a provision to help address Zika. This compromise provision will focus on immediate needs while also providing resources for longer term goals such as a vaccine. It is another reminder that keeping Americans safe and healthy is a top priority for us all. Let's continue our work today to move these important funding measures closer to passage.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3897 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, a home is more than just a roof over someone's head; it is actually where a family builds their lives. In our country, we need to do everything we can to make sure families have options when it comes to finding a place to live, and they need access to affordable, safe, and fair housing. Unfortunately, today Republicans want to deal a significant blow to fair housing. The amendment they are offering would tear down the civil rights protections in the Fair Housing Act of 1968, and I am here today to strongly urge my colleagues to vote against it. Before the civil rights movement, African Americans faced an enormous amount of injustice and racism in housing. People of color were often relegated to substandard housing. They were denied mortgages, and rent in an [[Page S3006]] African-American neighborhood was often higher than rent in a White neighborhood. When the Fair Housing Act went into effect in 1968, it not only banned discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing, it went a step further: A new Federal housing agency was charged with proactively rooting out discrimination and segregation in communities across the country. That is an important part of the law because today people across the country still face systemic and sometimes racially motivated barriers to housing. People with disabilities, people of color, families with children, and religious groups in many areas have limited housing choices. Last year the Department of Housing and Urban Development, also known as HUD, issued a long-overdue rule to help carry out that mission to proactively eliminate housing segregation and discrimination. For States and local governments that get HUD investments, this rule would improve the quality and access to data on demographics, it would help researchers analyze the barriers people face to access fair housing, and it would help set priorities and goals for carrying out the mission to actively fight back against discrimination and segregation. Based on pilot programs from around the country, we know this rule can help expand opportunity to more Americans. One of those pilots was in Seattle in my home State of Washington. After an assessment of high- poverty areas in Puget Sound, the city saw that neighborhoods that historically have been disenfranchised lacked job opportunities. Armed with that data, the city is setting up a food distribution center and a job incubator in those neighborhoods. The city's work is helping to foster job growth in places where low-income residents live, and through that work, the city expanded economic security to more people. That would not have been possible without the data this long-overdue rule provided us. This is the kind of success this new rule will help further, but unfortunately we are seeing that some Republicans want to put a stop to those positive changes and backtrack on the gains we have made on civil rights in housing, and to me, that is unacceptable. Here in Congress, we should be clearing pathways for more Americans to access more housing, not blocking the away. I am here today to urge my colleagues to vote against that amendment, which we will be voting on later. Mr. President, while I have the floor, I wish to talk about another topic that is very important to me. I am very honored to come to the floor today with good news for thousands of military families, including three couples I met just last week here in the Nation's Capital. Each of the veterans I met with had suffered a catastrophic injury while fighting for our country, which changed the course of their lives and their families' lives forever. Matt Keil was shot by a sniper and paralyzed. Kevin Jaye was injured by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Tyler Black was paralyzed during a firefight. What was the one thing each of these veterans wished for after he returned home and got out of the hospital? Well, like so many women and men in our country, they dreamed of having a family of their own. Even though each veteran suffered injuries that made it nearly impossible to conceive naturally, they have hope because in this day and age, the medical technology exists to make their dream of having a family come true. The most popular path is in vitro fertilization, known as IVF, but because of a policy enacted decades ago, the VA is barred from covering the costs of IVF, which forced Matt, Kevin, and Tyler, with their partners, to go down that road alone even though their injuries were caused while serving all of us overseas. Collectively, they have paid tens and tens of thousands of dollars out- of-pocket. Matt said to me that when he heard the VA wouldn't cover the one medical procedure he and his wife wanted so badly, he felt like his country had abandoned him. We are talking about a man who sacrificed his body for our country. I believe this is wrong. When this country sends brave men and women to work, we promise to take care of them when they return home. That is why I have been fighting to change this policy once and for all, and today I am very proud to see this effort take a big step forward with bipartisan support here in the Senate. My provision in the underlying VA appropriations bill will finally allow the VA to cover those costs and let our veterans know their country is there for them when they come home. It is the right thing to do for Matt and his wife Tracy, Kevin and Lauren, Tyler and Crystal, and every other military family in this country. As we move to pass this bill through the Senate, I call on my colleagues in the House to follow suit and get this done. This is not about politics or partisanship, and we shouldn't be cutting corners when it comes to our veterans and their families. This is a chance to support our veterans and the dreams they have fought so hard for--to have a family. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3900, as Modified Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I call for regular order with respect to the Blunt amendment No. 3900. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending. Mr. LEE. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise not to debate the broad question of the Federal Government's proper role in protecting and advancing public health; instead, I am here to stress to my colleagues that with a growing national debt that will soon exceed $20 trillion, we cannot continue spending money we don't have. If this emergency supplemental measure is adopted, it will be the 15th emergency supplemental we have passed since 2006, totaling about $190 billion in deficit spending. This is not how responsible governments budget. It is not how responsible governments behave. Indeed, we have the ability to provide the resources the country needs to fight the Zika virus without adding to our national debt. For starters, we can undo the $500 million President Obama took from the international infectious diseases account which was placed in his unapproved Green Climate Fund. USAID is sitting on $1.2 billion in unobligated Ebola funds. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response currently has $347 million not being put to use. There is $525 million in CDC's global health security agenda that is unspoken for. To the extent that the Zika virus is truly an emergency, one that deserves the Federal Government's attention, we already have more than enough unused emergency funds to pay for the fight against this emerging threat. Yesterday, my colleague, the distinguished junior senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Lankford, illustrated that this administration has tens of billions of dollars in unobligated discretionary funds to pay for this as well. What we should not do, however, is allow the Zika virus to be yet another excuse to run up the national debt, just so appropriators can come back and use unspent emergency money on nonemergency parochial priorities at some later date. The entire emergency spending label is to some, perhaps, a little bit misleading. It does not mean that the money gets spent any faster. All it does is give Congress the ability to spend the money without having to pay for it, to spend the money without having to offset it somewhere else. That is not how we should operate. I urge my colleagues to uphold this budget point of order. Mr. President, pursuant to section 314(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I raise a point of order against all of the emergency designations contained in amendment No. 3900, a list of which I am sending to the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I certainly share the deep concern expressed by my colleague from Utah over the growing size of the Federal debt. It is a serious problem. I encourage him to look at the chart that Senator Alexander has produced, which shows where the problem is. [[Page S3007]] The problem is on the mandatory side of the budget, not the discretionary side of the budget, which, due to efforts we have made, has been held relatively flat for several years. But the mandatory spending side of the budget is soaring. There is no doubt about that. For example, many of us, when the administration presented its budget, rejected the gimmicks that were included, for example, in the transportation budget to shift some $7 billion from discretionary to mandatory spending. That was unwarranted. We did not do that. But if ever there were an emergency, it is the threat posed to public health by the Zika virus. About 2 weeks ago, Senator Johnny Isakson and I went to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA, and heard briefings from the top experts in the world about the threat posed by the Zika virus. The fact is that the news keeps getting worse and worse. Zika has now been linked for certain to a severe kind of birth defect, making pregnant women particularly at risk. It has also been linked to a disease known as Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause paralysis and even death. Those of us who live in Northern States--this kind of mosquito, for example, is found only in the very southern tip of Maine--should take no comfort from that fact. The CDC has documented cases of the Zika virus in virtually every State in the Union, and that is because disease knows no boundaries in this world of international travel. In addition, the CDC has documented approximately 1,000 cases of Zika. It is an epidemic in Puerto Rico, where there are more than 475 documented cases--a true crisis for that U.S. territory. From my perspective, we have to act. We have to act quickly. The Blunt-Murray compromise bill deserves the emergency designation which is attached to it. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget regulations, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the Blunt-Murray amendment No. 3900, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I believe we are going to have that vote a little bit later. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Amendment No. 4039 Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, last night I was off the floor when Senator McCain of Arizona offered an amendment regarding the Veterans Choice bill. Before the decision is made, I wish to memorialize my support for the McCain amendment. As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, we waived jurisdiction so it could be offered on the VA component of this bill. I wish to add one further comment. The cost associated with extending the eligibility of Veterans Choice by 3 years, which is the McCain amendment, scores at a cost. But to recognize that cost, you have to assume we would not have treated an eligible veteran under any other program if Choice expired. We are never going to abandon our veterans. We have a commitment to the veterans for the health care they have signed up for. What Senator McCain is doing is trying to improve access to health care and to maintain access through the choice of a private sector provider or through a VA provider. There is no additional cost, unless you assume that you want to take away a benefit that we gave 2 years ago in the omnibus that we passed. I commend Senator McCain for extending the eligibility for Choice for 3 more years. I will support the amendment when it comes before the Senate, and I encourage all other Members to do the same. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. COLLINS.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on this amendment, I yield back the remainder of our time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time is yielded back. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 3946) was agreed to. Amendment No. 3900, as Modified, as Amended The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3900, offered by the majority leader for Mr. Blunt and Mrs. Murray. The Senator from Missouri. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, we have looked at the proposal. I think we have reached an agreement on the proposal that takes this issue up through September of next year. I think now is the time to move forward. I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment, and at that point we will work with the House for a final conclusion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that Republicans refused to work with us to fully fund the President's emergency supplemental proposal, and it shouldn't have taken us so long to get to this point, but I am pleased that this will move us to a down payment on the President's emergency funding package through the Senate. [[Page S3008]] I want to commend Chairman Blunt for his work with us on this and all the Democrats and Republicans who are supporting it. But I want to remind all of us, this is only a first step, and we have to make sure that this agreement gets through the House and to the President's desk in the least amount of time. I hope we can separate it from this bill and move it quickly. That was objected to yesterday over pay-fors, which are not part of this amendment, but this is a critical emergency. We need to move on this first step, and I hope we can do it in a timely manner. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. VITTER.

Amendments Nos. 3898 and 3899, as Modified, Withdrawn The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendments Nos. 3898 and 3899 are withdrawn. The Senator from Wyoming. Amendment No. 4039 Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his tremendous effort on behalf of veterans and the different approaches he has used. I don't think anybody has worked harder on it or understands it better. I wish there were more we could do for veterans and will work with him to see that that happens, but this amendment isn't the right place to do it. This amendment proposes that we increase overspending by $7.7 billion for a continuation of the Veterans Choice Program. It doesn't offer badly needed reforms to the program, it simply provides more funding. Unfortunately, the accountability measures currently in place at the VA do not go far enough in ensuring that the health care needs of our veterans are the priority. By extending the Choice Program, we would be extending problematic waiting periods, we would be extending a backlog of health care claims, and we would be giving little or no authority to the VA to manage its employees. We have been getting complaints about many of these things, and another veterans proposal in the Senate improves both health care access for veterans and expanded disciplinary [[Page S3009]] measures at the VA. Senator McCain has worked on that as well. At the same time, it provides offsets to ensure that we continue to help our veterans in the future. I have been concerned about what I thought was $6 billion of emergency expense every year. I had them actually total that up in the committee and found out that we do $26.1 billion a year in emergency spending. We are going to have to find that money somewhere because if we don't provide offsets, we will not be able to help our veterans or our military or our education or anything else. Continued spending without making responsible choices for priorities will put us in a real hole. In order to make sure we are spending on our priorities, such as national defense and our veterans, and that they are not crowded out, I raise a point of order. Mr. President, pursuant to section 314(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I raise a point of order against the emergency designation found on page 3, lines 7 through 12, of amendment No. 4039 to H.R. 2577, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note with some interest that the Senator from Wyoming did not have the same zeal for the $1.1 billion that we just passed in emergency spending for Zika that is not paid for, but the important issue is, that this is a program for 1.4 million appointments for veterans who would otherwise wait for delayed care, over 2.5 million separate payments to doctors, 450,000 Choice health care providers--the list goes on and on. All I am asking for is an extension of a program that is in effect and helping our veterans. The fact is, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee said last night: What Senator McCain is trying to do to improve access to health care is maintain the access through the choice of a private sector provider or VA provider. There is no additional cost unless you assume that you want to take away a benefit that was given 2 years ago in the omnibus bill we passed. He goes on to say he would support this amendment. Who is taking advantage? The majority of the people who are taking advantage of this Choice Card, I will tell the Senator from Wyoming, are the young men and women who are just returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. We are giving them a choice. We are giving them a choice to be able to get the care they need and deserve. In my home State of Arizona, 50 veterans died while on a nonexistent waiting list--50 of them. That is why we have a Choice Card, so they can go out and get the care they need and want and not be on a nonexistent waiting list. I don't know what the priorities are of the Senator from Wyoming, but I can tell him now, they are not mine, and they are not of the men and women who are serving this Nation who deserve the best care and the choice of going to the provider that they want to within certain parameters. This is simply an extension of a program that is in existence that cares for our men and women who served our Nation with sacrifice, and some of them didn't even come back to have a chance to have a Choice Card. Mr. President, I ask to waive the budget point of order. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable budget resolutions for the purposes of my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN.

The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 1:45 p.m. be equally divided between the two managers or their designees and that at 1:45 p.m. the Senate vote in relation to the Collins amendment No. 3970 and the Lee amendment No. 3897; further, that following disposition of the Lee amendment, all postcloture time be expired; that the substitute amendment, as amended, be adopted; that the cloture motion on the underlying bill be withdrawn, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the issue that was just brought up dealing with veterans funding and specifically the Choice Program. Three years ago, Congress put into place a response to what was happening in VA centers all over the country. We were all appalled with what was happening at VA centers all over the country. But for any of us who are in congressional offices, we were aware, were pushing on this issue, and had pushed on this issue for a while. But the media exposed what we all saw, and that was long-secret waiting lists for veterans so that the VA centers could keep their positive numbers up and look better--months of waiting for things that would take days across the street. As I dealt with the VA center in my own city, at times it would take 6 months to get a knee replacement surgery at the VA center, when at the great hospital directly across the street, they could get that same surgery within 2 days. As to hearing aids, it would take months and months to actually go through the process and to get them at our VA centers. As to cancer care, if you were diagnosed with cancer and had needs and treatment that was going to be required, they would literally send you across the country, sometimes more than 2,000 miles away, to actually get cancer treatment--away from your family. Congress responded to that by putting into place the Choice Act. It was an emergency. There were major problems that were happening around the country in multiple VA centers, and there had to be a response right then. Congress set aside emergency funding and an emergency response to make sure something came into existence that only loosely existed before. What was called community care was now clarified to say that this is Choice, and it was simple. If a veteran had to wait [[Page S3010]] more than 30 days to get into an appointment or get treatment or if they lived more than 40 miles from a VA center, they would be given the option to go wherever they wanted to go. VA was required to start working relationships in every community across the country so that veterans would have the option to go wherever they wanted to go. I would acknowledge that program is in its infancy. It is 2 years old at this point. It has a ways to go to be perfected. There are still problems with it, and there is a constant push from Congress to provide accountability to make sure that program is done and done well. That should be the first step in giving veterans real choice. The first step of that is 30 days or 40 miles. The second step of that is any VA- eligible veteran would get a card and they could go to anyplace that accepts Medicare. If they accept Medicare anywhere in the country--any lab, any hospital, any doctor--they should also be able to receive veterans as well. So veterans can go wherever they choose to go regardless of the distance. I have veterans who drive past six great hospitals, drive 200 miles to get to a VA center, and their families have the burden of all of that travel. It should not be that way. Veterans should be able to go wherever they choose to go for care. So the Choice Program is not only a good program, it is the right direction to go and it is a positive first step. But here is the problem: The way this particular amendment has come up, it is not only not germane to this bill because it deals with something that started 3 years ago and we are dealing with a new bill right now, but it is also an issue of, we are doing the right thing the wrong way. My staff has heard me say this over and over again: There is a right thing to do and there is a right way to do it. Three years ago, we knew this was an issue. Three years ago, the planning should have been put in place to put this into the normal appropriations process. This process puts it into place, so we are adding $7.5 billion onto our children for a program that should be in the normal appropriations process that was started 3 years ago and that is not an emergency anymore. This is not an emergency. This is now normal funding of a program we want to keep going and expand. So there is a big issue here we do have to resolve. I want to see us do the Choice Program and do it right, but there is a right thing to do and a right way to do it. This program is already fully funded through the next year. It is not an emergency. It is in place, funded, and ready to go. It doesn't go away in the next year, all the way through the fiscal year. Let's put it in the normal process, let's do it the right way, and let's not add $7 billion to our children for an emergency that is actually a year away. No one is going to convince me that in a $4 trillion budget, there are not areas we could cut. Earlier this week I identified $86 billion in funds that are available to cover the $1 billion for Zika that this Congress decided to do in emergency funding anyway. We have the funds available. We can honor our veterans. We can do this and also honor our children. At the same time we are honoring our veterans, let's honor the next generation and make sure we are not adding debt to the next generation. With that, Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the McCain amendment No. 4039 is not germane to the Collins amendment No. 3896, as amended, or H.R. 2577. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained, and the amendment falls. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support my VA spending bill to final passage. It is a very bipartisan bill. I also would like to thank my ranking Democratic member, Senator Jon Tester of Montana, who has been a great partner. We have worked with all Senators on both sides of the aisle to include their priorities and have worked through dozens of amendments. We include more than two dozen amendments in this bill. The bill provides record funding for our veterans' health care, protects whistleblowers, includes opioid safety, and also has the RAID Act to clean up the VA so that cockroaches are not in the VA kitchens and dining facilities. This bill also adds 100 staff to the IG's office and combats veteran homelessness. It requires better screening of VA doctors so they can't switch from State to State. The bill also increases medical research and adds money for health care for our veterans. I thank the subcommittee staff for doing outstanding work this year, and that includes Tina Evans, Chad Schulken, Michael Bain, Robert Henke, D'Ann Lettieri, Patrick Magnuson, and Carlos Elias. The bottom line: This bill does right by our troops and does right by our veterans. I thank my Senate colleagues and urge its rapid adoption. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to voice my full support for the fiscal year 2017 Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies appropriations bill which includes the fiscal year 2017 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and related agencies appropriations bill. Each of these bills was passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee by a vote of 30-0 last month. I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan package of bills. I commend Senators Collins and Reed for their hard work on the T-HUD bill and their collegiality on the floor this week managing this bill. T-HUD is our annual jobs bill making investments at the State and local level, delivering on America's physical infrastructure needs and America's compelling human needs. The bill before us will keep our roads and transportation systems safe and in good repair while preserving housing assistance for our Nation's most in need. I am especially proud of Senators Collins and Reed for making renewed investments in lead paint poison prevention. As the Maryland Senator from Baltimore, this is an issue I know all too well. Senator Kit Bond and I worked together on the VA-HUD bill to first bring attention to this crippling public health problem. April 19 marked the anniversary of Freddie Gray's death, a young man who grew up in Baltimore's low- income housing. Before Freddie's second birthday, his blood lead levels were seven times the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's suggested level, leaving Freddie severely and permanently brain damaged. Today there are still half a million children under the age of 6 with lead poisoning. This bill increases lead prevention funding in three programs. First, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes is funded at $135 million, an increase of $25 million to support lead-based paint hazard reductions in 1,750 additional units. This program provides safer homes for more than 6,200 people. Second, the Mikulski-Bond Lead Hazard Reduction Demo Program is funded at $55 million, an increase of $10 million. This program provides competitive funds to State and local governments to implement lead hazardous reduction programs in privately owned and owner-occupied housing. Third, the Public Housing Capital Fund is funded at $1.9 billion, an increase of $25 million. This will remediate 1,500 public housing units. This bill also includes a number of reforms to HUD's lead programs. Among these is the requirement for HUD to update its blood level standard to the stronger Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standard. HUD's standard hasn't been updated since 1999. In addition, the bill makes studio and efficiency apartments eligible for remediation grants for the first time. It is estimated that 34,000 zero-bedroom dwellings house children under 6 years old. The transportation portion of this bill makes significant investments in Maryland's highways, byways, and transit systems. It cuts the first check under the FAST Act passed last December. This means more formula funding for every State. For Maryland, that is an increase of $62 million. For transit, this bill provides increased funding for the Federal Transit [[Page S3011]] Administration totaling $575 million. It includes the Job Corridor- Purple Line project in the Washington suburbs of Maryland. A total of $125 million is provided for the construction of this light rail project. For the DC Metro system, this bill provides the eighth installment of $150 million in Federal dedicated funding. This is the fully authorized level and will be matched dollar for dollar by the three jurisdictions. Fighting for this annual appropriation was the promise I made and have kept since the deadly Fort Totten crash in June 2009. This funding must be used on capital improvements relating to safety including buying new rail cars, track improvements, and signal upgrades. I included bill language requiring the U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary to do three things before this funding money can be spent. First, the Secretary must approve each expenditure. Second, the Secretary must certify Metro is making progress implementing FTA's safety and financial management corrective actions. Third, the Secretary must determine that Metro is using this money for top safety priorities. In addition to this dedicated funding, I am proud of the safety amendment I introduced with Senators Shelby, Cardin, Warner, Kaine, and Brown that was passed earlier in the week. This amendment provides additional funding to FTA to expand its safety oversight workforce for a total increase of $5.25 million over the current year funding level. It will enable FTA to hire six full-time employees for Metro's Rail Operations Control Center, four more investigators, seven additional inspectors, and six more contractors. This additional funding means FTA will now have more inspectors to watch as Metro crews work to complete SafeTrack, the yearlong plan to accelerate repairs on the system. Inspectors will be there to make sure the track work is fixed the right way for good. FTA also will have safety staff at the Rail Operations Control Center 24 hours a day and 7 days a week making sure emergency procedures are followed to prevent future incidents. FTA staff will help Metro implement the National Transportation Safety Board's recent recommendations to overhaul the center's emergency operations and training. FTA staff will make sure these reforms remain in place and are followed. Finally, more investigators will help FTA tackle approximately 100 Metro investigations conducted each year. I also want to say a few words about the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. This is another bipartisan bill funding vital programs for the health and well-being of our Nation's veterans, troops, and their families developed by Senators Kirk and Tester. Overall, this bill provides $83 billion in discretionary funding which is an increase of $3.2 billion above the current year funding level. This bill fully funds VA Medical Services at the President's request of $52.8 billion. This is $1 billion over what we advanced last year to address increased demand for VA medical care both within and outside the VA health care system. The bill provides additional funding for disability claims processing. Significant progress has been made to eliminate the backlog in processing initial claims, but unfortunately, the backlog in appeals is rapidly building. This bill includes $2.9 billion for claims processing, $30 million above the request, to hire 300 new claims processors and 240 additional employees for the Board of Veterans Appeals. Also included is an increase of $46 million for the Board of Veterans Appeals, bringing their total funding to $156 million. This will provide for hiring an additional 240 new employees focused on appeals processing. For our women veterans, this bill makes significant strides bring parity between male and female veterans. This bill mandates that the VA research and acquire prosthetic devices specifically designed for women. It includes $5.3 billion overall to treat more than 500,000 female veterans who get care through the VA. This bill targets $535 million for gender-specific health care which is $20 million over the request and nearly $70 million over the current funding level. This includes gynecology, reproductive health, and mental health care for women. I also was proud to support Senator Murray's amendment in committee, allowing the VA to cover the cost of reproductive services for veterans who suffered service-related injuries that prevent them from starting families. The military construction part of this bill fully funds all seven Maryland projects included in the President's budget request. This means a total of $340 million for construction jobs at Fort Meade, Pax River, Joint Base Andrews, and Bethesda Medical Center. Finally, the bill includes $1.1 billion in emergency spending to combat the urgent Zika crisis. CDC, NIH, and USAID need this funding on the ground today. $1.1 billion is a bottom line, not a starting point for negotiation. I am committed to sending a Zika supplemental to the President as soon as possible. I urge all of my colleagues to support this package of bills. It meets many compelling human needs and physical infrastructure needs of our nation and does not include poison pill riders. It is an example of how, working together, we can solve problems and put America to work. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to speak in support of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs division of the substitute before us. I commend Chairman Kirk and Ranking Member Tester for their leadership in crafting the fiscal year 2017 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs funding bill. As a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, I have appreciated their steady, strong advocacy for our Nation's veterans, servicemembers, and their families. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I know well the sacrifices of those who serve and have served on our behalf, as well as the sacrifices made by their families. The vital programs and benefits funded by this bill will help fulfill our obligations to them and honor their commitment to our Nation. While we can never fully repay these debts, we must strive to provide each veteran with the quality health care that they deserve. One way this bill helps to meet this goal is through the extension it would provide of the highly successful Access Received Closer to Home, or ARCH, program. This pilot program, which is scheduled to expire in August, serves rural veterans in northern Maine, Montana, Kansas, Virginia, and Arizona, providing them access to high quality care in their communities and near their families. Many of my constituents tell me that this program has proven to be a lifeline for them and has saved them the arduous burden of traveling up to 600 miles round trip to receive care at the Togus VA Medical Center in Augusta, ME. In Maine, the program not only reduces wait times for appointments and prevents veterans from going through a third-party administrator to receive care, but it is cost effective. According to the VA's own statistics, the average cost of ARCH per veteran in Maine is less than half the average cost for VHA direct care. More than 90 percent of ARCH veterans are overwhelmingly satisfied with their care, a testament to why ARCH should be a model for the Nation. Ensuring that veterans continue to receive this seamless care is paramount, and I thank Chairman Kirk and Ranking Member Tester for including an extension of this vital program in the fiscal year 2017 funding legislation. I am also pleased that this legislation would fund the President's fiscal year 2017 request for VA medical leases, including funding to lease a new Community Based Outpatient Clinic--CBOC--facility in Portland, ME. This project would allow VA to consolidate and colocate the Saco and Portland CBOCs with Maine Medical Center and its affiliate, the Tufts University School of Medicine. This collaboration will provide primary care, mental health, women's health, and specialty care medical services for veterans. This legislation would also help to address the opioid epidemic by requiring the Department to improve appropriate pain care for veterans. It also includes programs to help end veteran homelessness, expand care services focused on our growing population of female veterans, and support caregivers, who shoulder the enormous responsibility of caring for veterans who are unable to care for themselves [[Page S3012]] Finally, I want to highlight the funding included in this legislation for our Nation's civilian and military members--and their families--who serve at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME. The legislation includes $74.9 million for housing, the replacement of the medical and dental clinic, and utility nuclear improvements. These projects will help provide the exceptional personnel at PNSY with the facilities they need and deserve to carry out the mission. Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their excellent work in balancing the priorities within their bill, and I urge my colleagues to advance this important legislation. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, universal, safe, and consistent trucking regulations are vital to all aspects of the trucking industry and to all users of the national highway system. Ensuring highway safety must remain a priority of this body. It also remains critical that this body maintain predictable safety laws to sustain efficient outcomes for truckers, trucking companies, the manufacturers and growers of the goods that trucks transport, and the customers who buy the products. Congress determined years ago that a uniform system of Federal trucking rules would lead to safer and more productive outcomes than a 50-State patchwork of trucking regulations, as goods are often transported across State lines. Despite Congress's intentions, we are seeing various State trucking rules being implemented across the country that stray from the Federal guidelines. We need to figure out how to address this. We need to make sure that we have commonsense rules that don't change every time a driver crosses a State line while continuing to protect truck drivers and road users from unsafe situations. I think we have got a little more work to do before we are ready for a solution, but I pledge to work with all who are willing and maybe we can figure something out in the coming months. Thank you. Maritime Security Program Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I join today with my good friend, Senator Hirono, to address the requirement for full authorized funding of the Maritime Security Program. Senator Hirono and I serve together on the Seapower Subcommittee and firmly believe that this program is important to our national security. The United States needs a U.S.-flag merchant marine that is strong, active, competitive, and useful to the military. Our merchant marine has a long history of providing sealift support to our Armed Forces for global military operations. The Maritime Security Program is a unique public-private partnership that helps the merchant marine, enhancing America's commercial sealift capability while saving the American taxpayer billions of dollars. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Seapower Subcommittee, I could not agree more with the Senator from Mississippi's views concerning the importance of the MSP program. The 60-ship MSP program is the most prudent and economical means to address the U.S. military's current and projected sealift requirements. A 2006 report prepared for the Military Sealift Committee of the National Defense Transportation Association concluded that ``the likely cost to the government to replicate just the vessel capacity provided by the MSP dry cargo vessels would be $13 billion.'' In addition, the U.S. Transportation Command, TransCom, has estimated that it would cost the U.S. Government an additional $52 billion to replicate the ``global intermodal system'' that is made available to the Department of Defense, DOD, by MSP participants. In contrast, MSP participants now provide DOD with the same vessels and global intermodal system at a fraction of what it would cost our government to do the job itself. Mr. WICKER. The Senate version of the Transportation-HUD Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2017 includes $275 million for the Maritime Security Program. This is an increase of $65 million above the enacted level for fiscal year 2016. Although we are pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee has recommended this increase in funding, we hasten to point out that Congress acted last December to increase the authorization level for the Maritime Security Program to $299,997,000 for fiscal year 2017. The House Appropriations Committee has recommended funding for the next fiscal year that would meet this authorization. As this appropriations bill works its way through Congress, we urge the chairs and ranking members of the Transportation-HUD Appropriations Subcommittees and the full Appropriations Committee to work in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to provide funding for the Maritime Security Program at its fully authorized level of $299,997,000 for fiscal year 2017. Ms. HIRONO. I strongly agree with Senator Wicker. Despite the clear benefits the MSP program provides, the MSP commercial fleet is under extreme economic pressure from reductions in government-impelled cargoes and foreign competitive factors. I completely share the concerns expressed by the then-TransCom commander, GEN Paul Selva, in his March 2015 testimony before the Armed Services Committee, where he stated that the ``reduction in government impelled cargoes due to the drawdown in Afghanistan and reductions in food aid . . .are driving vessel owners to reflag to non-U.S.-flag out of economic necessity . . .With the recent vessel reductions, the mariner base is at the point where future reductions in U.S.-flag capacity puts our ability to fully activate, deploy and sustain forces at increased risk.'' Accordingly, to ensure that this essential U.S. commercial sealift capability provided by the MSP program remains available to meet America's national security requirements, the MSP program needs to be fully funded as authorized by the Congress. Mr. WICKER. I would like to add a comment from the current TransCom commander, GEN Darren McDew. In January, General McDew said, ``As a military professional and senior leader, I think about and plan for what the future may hold, and I would tell you we must prepare for the real possibility we will not enjoy the uncontested seas and broad international support experienced in 1991. If either of those possibilities becomes reality, and if we remain committed to responding to security incidents around the globe, the only way of guaranteeing we decisively meet our national objectives is with U.S. ships operated by U.S. mariners.'' I thank Senator Hirono for joining me in this effort to ensure that full funding is secured for the Maritime Security Program in fiscal year 2017. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. U.S. Innovation and Competitiveness Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the need to drive innovation and competitiveness here in the United States. I vividly remember watching the Apollo missions on TV and the launch of that 36-story tall Saturn V rocket that took Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the surface of the Moon. The space program not only inspired a generation of Americans, but it also led to incredible advances in science and technology that over the last 50 years have accounted for as much as half of all the economic growth in the United States. These groundbreaking advances firmly established our Nation as an international leader in innovation. During the height of the space race, America's Federal investment in research and development reached nearly 2 percent of the Nation's GDP. Today, overall Federal R&D spending--the seed corn of our future prosperity--has fallen to a historic low of 0.78 percent of GDP. With the United States investing less on science, research, and education, and our competitors outpacing us, we are losing our footing in the global marketplace. Congress must increase the Federal investment in R&D to 1 percent of GDP if we want to continue to be leading the world in innovation. This commitment should include a focus on increased Federal support for basic research--an essential component of any kind of innovation economy. [[Page S3013]] In addition to increased investment, we in Congress need to implement policy solutions that will reassert American leadership internationally. We need to invest in what works. We need to listen to the innovators, academic leaders, and industries that are making the life-changing inventions of the future a reality. To that end, my colleague Senator Cory Gardner and I have convened a series of roundtable discussions on ways to improve the American innovation system. Just last week, our Commerce Committee leaders, Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson, held a productive hearing on ways to leverage the U.S. science and technology enterprise. After receiving input from industry, academia, science organizations, and economic development organizations, Senators Thune, Nelson, Gardner, and I are working to develop new legislation to guide our Nation's research priorities in the coming years and to improve America's innovation system. Through these roundtables, we heard that the stakeholder community agrees that modest, sustained, and predictable increases in Federal research and development investments are absolutely critical to ensuring the economic competitiveness of the United States. We need continued Federal investment in basic research, while also providing opportunities to commercialize that research. There is basic research that our companies simply cannot afford to conduct, making Federal investment absolutely critical. We also need to work to reduce administrative burdens on researchers so that we can maximize our Federal research investment. We need that investment to be put into the lab and not filling out more paperwork. We need stronger partnerships between government, the private sector, and academia in order to capitalize on discoveries emerging from our world-class research universities, such as the University of Michigan, Wayne State University, and Michigan State University. We must also close the significant employment gap in the STEM workforce for women and underrepresented minorities. Women make up less than 50 percent of post-bachelor STEM degree programs and only about one-quarter of the STEM workforce. Underrepresented minorities, including Hispanics and African Americans, make up about 10 percent of the science and engineering workforce. Last month, I joined a number of my colleagues in introducing the STEM Opportunities Act, legislation that would improve inclusion of women, minorities, and people with disabilities in STEM careers. It is a top priority for me to see that a similar provision is included in our bipartisan legislation. Finally, if we want to continue to be a leader in the global economy, we need to be a nation that makes things. Michigan is a State that builds and grows things, and I will continue to fight to make sure we continue doing that. Investments in advanced manufacturing will support firms of all sizes and support good-paying jobs and help keep them here in the United States. That is why it is one of my top priorities for this legislation that we ensure American manufacturing companies can compete and succeed in the highly competitive global marketplace. Last month, I joined my colleagues, Senators Coons and Ayotte, to introduce the bipartisan Manufacturing Extension Partnership Improvement Act. The Manufacturing Extension Program, or MEP, is a Federal public-private partnership that helps businesses get their products to market through a variety of consulting services. The MEP Improvement Act would expand and improve the MEP Program to serve small- and medium-sized manufacturing companies, which are a critical part of our economy and our national competitiveness. Including key components of the MEP Improvement Act will be a top priority for me in the new legislation being drafted. Science and technology are inseparable from the American competitiveness ecosystem. However, we need to focus on the entire ecosystem--from STEM, or STEAM, to basic research, to application and commercialization--and the inspiration that drives ambitious endeavors like exploring space and the other frontiers of science. We in Congress must do our part by supporting and investing in our efforts to drive economic growth, unleash increased productivity, enhance our safety and security, and make the world a better place for future generations. We are facing big challenges as a Nation, but I am committed to working with everyone--Democrats, Republicans, industry, academia, workers, students, and employers--to increase investments and implement the solutions that will ensure American competitiveness and create more good-paying jobs here in the United States. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if there is one specialty that every Member of Congress has, it is air travel. We spend more time on airplanes, more time in airports, more time waiting for flights and worrying about flights than most other Americans. As Members of Congress, we are veterans of air travel. We have all seen the footage of people waiting to go through security screening at major airports, particularly in the city of Chicago at both O'Hare and Midway. The lines are so long that people have had to wait 2 to 3 hours--2 to 3 hours to go through a security checkpoint. People are angry, and I don't blame them. Thousands of people have missed their flights, and some were stuck sleeping in airports overnight. The commissioner of aviation, Ginger Evans, told me: We pulled out the cots that we save for snow emergencies so that people now, in the heat of early summer, are facing the same kinds of delays. Our highest priority is to protect those who travel on our airplanes. Poor planning and inadequate funding have led to alarming delays across airports in America, and in Chicago we have felt it more than most. More needs to be done to fix the problem. That is what I have been working to do. Earlier this week, I talked to the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on the phone about the next steps. Yesterday, I followed up with a call to TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger to hear his thoughts. We all agree that the real problem is the shortage of TSA screeners. More people need to be hired and trained so security lines can stay open and people can move through the checkpoints faster. In the meantime, there are immediate steps we need to take in Chicago. First, we are going to get 58 more TSA screening officers in the next 2 weeks and 224 by August. That is about a 15-percent increase in TSA staff, and it is a good start. O'Hare will also receive 5 K-9 teams. That will double the number of K-9s we have at the airport. Two teams were brought in yesterday, and the rest will arrive within 5 days. These bomb-sniffing dogs do important work. They check carry-on baggage. If there is no problem, the passengers can move out of the standard line and into the expedited line. These dogs can help us speed up the process by allowing up to 5,000 additional passengers a day to move through the faster security lines. There will also be a shift of 100 TSA staff from part-time to full- time status so more people can be on deck to help with the lines. And officers who currently work on nondirect security functions are going to be called to pitch in and help officers at the checkpoints. We are also working to get more people enrolled in TSA PreCheck. I can't emphasize enough how important that is. For $85, a regular traveler can buy--or at least apply for and be given--a TSA PreCheck status for 5 years. PreCheck lines can scan nearly twice as fast as the ordinary lines. Customers don't have to wait as long or remove their shoes, belts, or light jackets. We need to make sure more people are hearing about this option and are signing up for it as quickly as possible. TSA is now working on a mobile app to help people get enrolled while they are waiting in lines, and they are also looking at lowering PreCheck signup costs by competing out the actual function of signing up for PreCheck. [[Page S3014]] PreCheck has gotten a lot of traction, especially in Chicago, where this past month alone we have seen 5,700 new enrollments. I hope we can continue to quickly expand this program to help more people into the faster lines. The airlines have to be part of the solution as well. I am glad Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut is on the floor because both he and Senator Markey of Massachusetts spoke out early on this aspect that I am about to address. Airlines can help us by reducing high wait times, especially during the peak summer season. I have joined my colleagues Senator Blumenthal and Senator Markey in urging the airlines to suspend the checked bag fees over the summer. A lot of people are dragging their bags on the airplanes because they don't want to pay to have them checked. On Monday, I spoke with Secretary Johnson, who told me baggage fees are contributing to long lines because more people are carrying on luggage that should be carefully screened through check-in. Over the last year, the volume of passengers and personnel passing through security checkpoints has increased 7 percent while the number of checked bags has increased only 3 percent. That tells the story: More people are carrying on their luggage and causing problems as more travelers pack their roller bags to the brim, making the bags take even longer to be scanned. Waiving the checked baggage fee during the summer travel season can reduce the incentive for passengers to carry-on luggage, and it can help speed up the process. Let me also add that it is in this baggage that people are dragging onboard that TSA screeners are finding things that aren't supposed to be on an airplane. Last year, they found 2,653 firearms, and 83 percent of them were loaded. Most of them were from one State; I will not name it. But by and large, we have to be more mindful of the fact that this stops the process or at least slows it down. I am convening a meeting with Administrator Neffenger tomorrow, along with State and local officials and airlines at Chicago O'Hare, and then we are also going to be visiting the Midway airport. We will see firsthand what airlines are experiencing and what their response is. We have to stop this meltdown when it comes to airport security. Let me close by saying this: The news today about EgyptAir was a grim reminder that we still live in a very dangerous world. The role and responsibility of the Transportation Security Agency is to make sure that when we and our families travel, we come off those planes just as safely as we went on. It is an important security responsibility. Yes, it is an irritation and a frustration, but we need to do it in this dangerous world to make sure that we stop people from using their carry-on baggage and other sources to cause harm to innocent people. I stand behind TSA and its mission, but what happened in Chicago is unacceptable. This meltdown should have been avoided. There should have been better management, more screeners, and we should have been ready for the surge in passengers. Beginning this week, we are going to make that right. I hope the visit by the TSA Administrator tomorrow will be the beginning of a conversation that will not only help our airports in Chicago but also help our Nation. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from Illinois for his leadership on this issue and his support for the initiative that Senator Markey and I first raised, which he has supported so very helpfully, and essentially that is to persuade the airlines to stop charging for bags that are checked onto planes as opposed to being carried on. Obviously, the fee for checking those bags adds to the number of carry-ons and provides an incentive for larger numbers of carry-ons. In fact, TSA itself reports that there has been an increase in carry-ons due to these fees. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank the Presiding Officer. The elimination of the fees for checked bags is not a panacea. It is not going to solve this problem alone. But it will, along with other measures, help reduce lines that result from screening. I commend Admiral Neffenger for his very close and prompt attention to this matter and for a number of the initiatives he has taken. We heard about them in the Commerce Committee this morning. I also thank Secretary Johnson for supporting elimination of the fees for checked bags. I think his leadership will be important. There are a number of other initiatives that can and should be taken. There is automated equipment that can expedite the screening of those carry-on bags. The use of additional screeners is important. The number has been reduced over the last 3 years by about 5,800. The addition of another close to 800 will help compensate. But again, alone, none of these solutions will provide the answer. As far as the automated equipment is concerned, the cost for the 20 busiest airports is about $30 million--a pittance compared to the $3.8 billion in revenue the airlines make every year as a result of the fees for checked baggage. I will repeat that: $3.8 billion is going to airlines as a result of their purposefully charging for bags checked instead of carried on. Many of those bags that go through screening now wind up in the holds of those airplanes anyway because there isn't room for them on the plane, so they wind up being checked at the gate. That simply adds to the cost and inconvenience of passengers: delayed flights, missed flights, flights that are in effect late because of the boarding problems. All of these accumulating issues are reasons to eliminate these fees and also give passengers the benefit of lower costs. My hope is that the airlines will voluntarily eliminate these fees for checked bags. After the meeting we had today with Admiral Neffenger, I am encouraged that the TSA will take initiative and help to implement other measures as well. In the meantime, we need the airlines to show some leadership as well, and I am hopeful they will do the right thing. The U.S. Travel Association has called it a national crisis. The evidence is irrefutable. At checkpoints that have no fee charges for bags, the carry-ons are 27 percent lower, so the numbers of carry-ons definitely diminish as the fees are eliminated. This evidence is irrefutable and argues powerfully that the airlines should not keep their passengers waiting in line. They should make some sacrifice to their bottom line and should not be profiting at the expense of their passengers. I will conclude by saying on this point--and I am so glad to see my colleague and friend from Massachusetts--that we need this initiative now, and we need it to happen. I also want to advocate on behalf of the safety of our roads. Blumenthal amendment No. 4002 will not be called up in part because it had been willfully mischaracterized by an industry campaign. In effect, we need to make truck drivers more safely empowered on the roads to take steps to protect themselves. Drivers who spend too much time behind the wheel are tired. They can't drive as safely. This amendment would enable them to drive more safely, give them the rest they need, protect them, and enable the roads to be safer not only for them but for people generally. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I yield to Senator Markey. Mr. MARKEY. I just want to thank the Senator for his work. We have been partnering on this issue of eliminating bag fees at airports. Since they have been imposed, 27 percent more bags now go through baggage clearing with passengers. If we could just get that out of the way, get rid of those baggage fees, I think it would expedite dramatically the ability of people to get on planes in this country. So I am glad we are able to have this moment to be able to speak about the importance of this issue. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, the Senator from Massachusetts and I have been partners in this effort, and I hope we can prevail. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. [[Page S3015]] Amendment No. 3970 to Amendment No. 3896 Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I call up the Collins-Reed-Cochran amendment No. 3970. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment numbered 3970 to amendment No. 3896. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to carry out a final rule and notice of the Department of Housing and Urban Development) At the appropriate place in division A, insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to direct a grantee to undertake specific changes to existing zoning laws as part of carrying out the final rule entitled ``Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing'' (80 Fed. Reg. 42272 (July 16, 2015)) or the notice entitled ``Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Assessment Tool'' (79 Fed. Reg. 57949 (September 26, 2014)). Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the amendment that Senator Jack Reed, Senator Thad Cochran, and I are offering would make very clear that none of the funds made available in this appropriations bill can be used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to direct a recipient of Federal funds to undertake changes to their zoning laws. There has been concern that some have brought up that a new rule that was issued last year by the Department would somehow allow HUD to be the national zoning authority for every neighborhood in our country. While I do not believe that is a correct interpretation of the fair housing amendment or regulation that HUD has promulgated, the Collins- Reed-Cochran amendment ensures that HUD cannot do that. It eliminates that possibility and ensures that communities will continue to make their own decisions to address these Federal requirements. By contrast, the proposal offered by my colleague from Utah, Senator Lee, would prohibit all funding for a rule that was issued by HUD based on a requirement that is included in the landmark civil rights era law known as the Fair Housing Act of 1968. It is important to know that this regulation was in direct response to a 2010 GAO report that criticized HUD's implementation of the requirement of the law that grantees, recipients of these funds, affirmatively enhance fair housing opportunities. It also was issued in response to requests from communities seeking guidance to ensure compliance because they don't want to be sued for inadvertently violating Fair Housing Act requirements. So communities asked HUD for more tools, better assessments, and more guidance to make sure that they were in compliance. It is important to know that the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination not only based on race, national origin, and religion but also against those with disabilities. Indeed, 56 percent of the complaints of housing discrimination have been initiated by individuals with disabilities. That is why Senator Lee's amendment is opposed by the Paralyzed Veterans of America and other disability groups, as well as the Urban League, the NAACP, and countless civil rights groups. On the first vote, we will be voting on the Collins-Reed-Cochran amendment. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Will Senator Collins yield briefly for a question? Ms. COLLINS. Yes, I will yield. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Senator Collins and every member of this body know that I support fair housing. It is so important for my State, where there is a lack of affordable housing, and the Anchorage School District is one of the most diverse in the Nation. However, I have heard concerns from people in Alaska. They worry not so much about the rule itself but about how HUD could implement it. Many communities in Alaska are overwhelmingly Alaska Native, 90 percent or more of the population. Will this affirmatively furthering fair housing rule result in Federal grants being withheld from communities that are currently and have long been populated almost entirely by Alaska Natives because those communities are now considered to be segregated? Ms. COLLINS. No community in the United States or its insular areas will lose Federal housing funds solely because of its racial demographics. There are communities throughout the United States that are racially homogenous for reasons that have nothing to do with discrimination or other historic barriers. The rule does not change the Fair Housing Act, which for decades has included the affirmative fair housing requirement. The whole purpose of the rule is to ensure that States and communities that receive Federal funds take this requirement seriously. This rule is a planning tool, created to help grantees identify barriers to fair housing and plan how to address them. The rule does not penalize any community for where it starts but rather assists a community in taking meaningful steps to address any barriers it may find. HUD would never deny Federal funds to a community simply because of its demographics. It has never done so in the 48 years since the passage of the Fair Housing Act, and it will not under this rule. Additionally, I know some have expressed concern about what effect this rule would have on Alaskan Natives and other Native Americans. HUD's housing programs for Native Alaskans and other Native Americana are authorized under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act, NAHASDA. NAHASDA includes a statutory exemption from the Fair Housing Act, which the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule does not change. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule, which my amendment would defund, is equal parts condescension and willful blindness. The condescension of this particular rule and its proponents is that local governments and public housing authorities across America can't figure out how to provide fair and affordable housing to their communities without the help, without the paternalistic interference of Federal bureaucrats. This is the epitome of the paternalism that informs so much of what happens in Washington, DC, today. I don't doubt, as Senator Collins has said repeatedly, that local governments would like ``better guidance'' from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington. But this is a problem that was created by HUD, with its onerous requirements and its vague mandates, not the result of local governments being unable or unwilling to provide adequate low-cost housing for their neighbors in need. This brings us to the willful blindness part of the affirmative furthering fair housing rule. Proponents of the rule claim that HUD officials consulted closely with local governments and public housing authorities when drafting and finalizing the AFFH rule. In their telling, local housing agencies across the country are welcoming the AFFH rule with open arms. But this ignores what local officials have actually said about AFFH. I will let these local officials speak for themselves. Roger Partridge, the county commissioner of Douglas County, CO, had this to say, in an email, about AFFH, the closed process that produced it, and the immense burdens it will place on local governments: Douglas County believes that the Assessment of Fair Housing tool as it now stands is an unfunded mandate that will create an administrative nightmare for jurisdictions who want to further fair housing and implement community programs with HUD grants. Partridge continues: HUD headquarters has repeatedly ignored the local practitioners responsible for AFFH and implementing the AFH in our communities. He continues: In fact, HUD headquarters staff was in Denver for a Public AFFH roundtable on April 21st, during [the AFH tool] comment period. They ignored the opportunity to inform Region VIII Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) staff or the local practitioners attending the roundtable. No notice from the HUD EXCHANGE to the grantee list serve was found. The local governments who were asked to comment on the publication were shut out of the process. Likewise, this is what we have heard from Salt Lake County officials: The administrative burden imposed by this tool is excessive. Resources that could be put [[Page S3016]] into housing related tasks are being funneled into completing the tool and its associated administrative tasks. Additionally, although HUD claims that this tool can be completed without the use of a consultant, the assessment is complex enough to warrant considering a consultant. The rule imposes a jurisdictional and regional analysis that is too complex to be effectively completed by staff without specific statistical and mapping knowledge. As housing providers, most staff at PHAs have comparative advantages that lie in providing affordable housing services, but not providing complex statistical data analysis. Forcing PHA staff to do this analysis is an inefficient use of their scarce time. Salt Lake County officials added the following: The AFH does not recognize the zero-sum nature of a PHA's resource allocation. By allocating resources to complete this process, PHAs are not allocating resources somewhere else. Those resources could be used to provide additional housing assistance. Instead of ignoring the words and the experiences of our local officials, and instead of condescending to them, we should listen to them and learn from them. We should stop this disastrous new housing rule from causing more problems than it has already caused. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Alabama is going to speak, and the Senator from Rhode Island should have an opportunity to speak. So I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute for each side prior to the votes in this series. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Lee's amendment that would prevent the implementation of HUD's affirmatively furthering fair housing regulation. Contrary to statements that have been made, the Senator's amendment does nothing to change fair housing laws or to prevent the enforcement thereof. What the Lee amendment does is to prevent the implementation of a rule that would give HUD Federal control over local planning decisions. Supporters of this program have argued that it is intended to protect communities from fair housing lawsuits. It is quite the contrary. This rule, if allowed to be implemented, will actually lay the predicate for endless litigation against every community in our respective States that are required to participate. This should be unacceptable to every Member of this body. Supporting Senator Lee's amendment is the only option before us to prevent centralized Federal control of local planning decisions. In my judgment, the Collins-Reed amendment does nothing to restrain the full implementation of HUD's program. I urge my colleagues to support the Lee amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. REED. Mr. President, the pending amendment is authored by my colleague from Maine and myself. The amendment makes very clear that local officials will remain in charge of zoning decisions and will determine how to best meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act. Those obligations are fundamental to our American fabric, our lives, and the aspirations of this country, because they protect Americans' housing choices no matter their physical ability, race, family status, or religion. These protections are fundamental to who we are. But without effective information and transparency so that local communities can make wise decisions, these aspirations can never be realized, are seldom realized, or are not realized to the extent that we, as Americans, feel that they should be. Senator Collins and I have worked very hard to develop language that provides local communities with wide flexibility to meet their requirements under the Fair Housing Act. Those requirements will still be there regardless of our action today. If the resources made available under the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing regulations are not provided, however, those communities will still be required to ensure that housing is available within their communities, regardless of race, physical ability, or the other protected classes under the law. The Lee amendment would make grantees liable for compliance without providing the data and tools needed to comply. The thrust--the heart and soul--of this HUD proposal, based on GAO analysis, is to give local communities the tools, so that they can determine the local answer that makes sense. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 4 minutes equally divided on the Collins amendment. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Let me just reiterate what I have been saying repeatedly. What the amendment Senator Reed, Senator Cochran, and I have introduced does is make very clear that HUD is prohibited from intervening in local decisions regarding zoning ordinances. That is in direct response to what some people have been claiming, incorrectly in my view; that the rule on affirmatively furthering fair housing would somehow allow HUD to be a national zoning commissar. That is not the case, but to make absolutely sure that could never happen, we have teamed up on this amendment to prohibit HUD from intervening in local zoning matters. It is very different from the Lee amendment, which we will discuss shortly. This is an important clarification that should take away any fear that there is any possibility of HUD using funds authorized by this bill to interfere in local zoning decisions. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Maine in and of itself is unobjectionable and does no harm, and on that basis I intend to vote for it. Unfortunately, it also doesn't do anything. It does nothing to help the many housing agencies that have told the Federal Government that President Obama's AFFH rule imposes far too many reporting costs and their already stretched staffs are going to suffer as a result. It does nothing to shield local housing authorities from the very many real lawsuits they will face as a result of the data collected from this regulation, and it does nothing to stop HUD from blackmailing local housing agencies with Community Development Block Grant Program funds. At this time, I wish to cede the remainder of my time to my friend, the senior Senator from Alabama. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we should all be aware that the Collins- Reed amendment provides no protections to local communities on their local planning rules because it merely prohibits an activity that the rule does not contemplate. Even the sponsor of this amendment acknowledged earlier today that the amendment prohibited an activity that she believed would not occur. Make no mistake that the so-called affirmatively furthering fair housing rule will likely heavily influence local zoning decisions. However, it does so indirectly, not through direct action as in the Collins-Reed amendment. HUD advertises this fact on its own Web site, where it details how communities will have to submit for approval an assessment of fair housing and that these communities will ``use the fair housing goals and priorities established in their [assessment] to inform the investments and other decisions made in their local planning processes.'' In other words, HUD does not intend to direct any specific zoning requirements. It does, however, intend to significantly influence local zoning decisions by withholding approval of local plans until they meet HUD's central planning goals. This amendment is not sufficient on its own. I believe the only way to prevent HUD from intruding into local community planning exactly as they openly state they intend to do is to support the Lee amendment. I believe the Collins-Reed amendment is not alternative to Senator Lee's amendment, it is, at best, complementary to the Lee amendment, and that is something we will have to vote on in just a few minutes. I thank the Presiding Officer. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of time on our side, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? [[Page S3017]] There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN: I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Heinrich), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 87, nays 9, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 80 Leg.] YEAS--87 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Blunt Boozman Burr Cantwell Capito Carper Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Lee Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Mikulski Moran Murkowski Murray Nelson Paul Perdue Peters Portman Reed Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Schumer Scott Sessions Shaheen Shelby Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Warner Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--9 Booker Brown Cardin Menendez Merkley Murphy Reid Schatz Warren NOT VOTING--4 Boxer Cruz Heinrich Sanders The amendment (No. 3970) was agreed to. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Ms. COLLINS. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 3897 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). There is now 4 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the Lee amendment No. 3897. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the subsequent votes in this series be 10 minutes in length. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, unlike the Collins amendment that just passed with broad support, my amendment would actually do something with respect to affirmatively furthering the fair housing rule. Specifically, it would defund this rule and ultimately force the Department of Housing and Urban Development to respond to the GAO in a way that does not undermine local control or increase costs on already stretched thin local housing agencies. My colleagues who oppose this amendment have given a number of examples of local governments being newly connected to make better governing decisions, but my amendment in no way stops local governments from continuing to do that. All my amendment does--the only thing it does--is to prevent the Federal Government from forcing local governments to comply with a costly and unnecessary new data collection program, and it does so in order to protect local autonomy. I therefore encourage each of my colleagues to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my colleague Senator Lee would prohibit all funding for a fair housing regulation issued by HUD based on a requirement of a landmark civil rights law, the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Not only was this not a regulation that appeared out of thin air, the GAO did a report criticizing HUD, and once the regulation was implemented, closed the recommendation. In addition, communities asked HUD to issue better guidance on this part of the law so that they could avoid being sued under the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I move to table the Lee amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz).

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Amendments Nos. 4050 and 4026, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3896 Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number: Amendment No. 4050, offered by Senator Rubio; and amendment No. 4026, as modified, offered by Senator Baldwin. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the amendments en bloc by number. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for others, proposes amendments numbered 4050 and 4026, as modified, en bloc to amendment No. 3896. The amendments are as follows: amendment no. 4050 (Purpose: To make temporary relocation assistance available for tenants in project-based section 8 properties with imminent health and safety risks) On page 85, line 6, insert ``Provided further, That the Secretary may provide section 8 rental assistance from amounts made available under this paragraph for units assisted under a project-based subsidy contract funded under the `Project-Based Rental Assistance' heading under this title where the owner has received a Notice of Default and the units pose an imminent health and safety risk to residents: Provided further, That to the extent that the Secretary determines that such units are not feasible for continued rental assistance payments or transfer of the subsidy contract associated with such units to another project or projects and owner or owners, any remaining amounts associated with such units under such contract shall be recaptured and used to reimburse amounts used under this paragraph for rental assistance under the preceding proviso:'' before ``Provided further,''. amendment no. 4026, as modified (Purpose: To prohibit certain health care providers from providing non- Department health care services to veterans) At the end of title II of division B, add the following: SEC. 251. PREVENTION OF CERTAIN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FROM PROVIDING NON-DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO VETERANS. (a) In General.--One year after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs [[Page S3018]] shall deny or revoke the eligibility of a health care provider to provide non-Department health care services to veterans if the Secretary determines that-- (1) the health care provider was removed from employment with the Department of Veterans Affairs due to conduct that violated a policy of the Department relating to the delivery of safe and appropriate patient care; (2) the health care provider violated the requirements of a medical license of the health care provider; (3) the health care provider had a Department credential revoked and the Secretary determines that the grounds for such revocation impacts the ability of the health care provider to deliver safe and appropriate care; or (4) the health care provider violated a law for which a term of imprisonment of more than one year may be imposed. (b) Permissive Action.--One year after enactment of this Act, the Secretary may deny, revoke, or suspend the eligibility of a health care provider to provide non- Department health care services if the Secretary has reasonable belief that such action is necessary to immediately protect the health, safety, or welfare of veterans and-- (1) the health care provider is under investigation by the medical licensing board of a State in which the health care provider is licensed or practices; (2) the health care provider has entered into a settlement agreement for a disciplinary charge relating to the practice of medicine by the health care provider; or (3) the Secretary otherwise determines that such action is appropriate under the circumstances.

(4) Such recommendations as the Comptroller General considers appropriate regarding harmonizing eligibility criteria between health care providers of the Department and health care providers eligible to provide non-Department health care services. (f) Non-Department Health Care Services Defined.--In this section, the term ``non-Department health care services'' means-- (1) services provided under subchapter I of chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, at non-Department facilities (as defined in section 1701 of such title); (2) services provided under section 101 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-146; 38 U.S.C. 1701 note); (3) services purchased through the Medical Community Care account of the Department; or (4) services purchased with amounts deposited in the Veterans Choice Fund under section 802 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now vote on these amendments en bloc. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on these amendments. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the amendments, the question is on agreeing to the amendments en bloc.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before I make some closing remarks, I would yield to Senator Reed, who has been such an extraordinary partner as we have worked together in a transparent and collaborative way to bring this bill across the finish line. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me return the compliment to the Chairman of the committee, Senator Collins of Maine, for her extraordinary insight, leadership, and ability to bring us together. This bill reflects the priorities of members on both sides of the aisle, it reflects sound policy, and it was a pleasure to work with her. I think that she will also commend our extraordinary staffs who provided support, working many times when we were not working to get the job done. I thank Dabney Hegg, Heideh Shahmoradi, Christina Monroe, Nathan Robinson, Jordan Stone, Jason Woolwine, Mike Clarke, Lydia Collins, and Gus Maples. These are professionals who are thoughtful, skillful, pleasant, and probably deserving of the real praise for work done on the floor. Let me once again thank Senator Collins for her thoughtful leadership and her commitment to fairness and principle. I think that she is one of the major reasons we are here today. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senate has completed its consideration of this appropriations measure, which provides essential funding for the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, related agencies, military construction programs, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and to combat Zika. I thank all of my colleagues for working together with us in an open and collaborative manner. I would note that the legislation we just passed incorporates some 40 [[Page S3019]] amendments. There were also recommendations from more than 75 Senators from both sides of the aisle included in the Transportation-HUD appropriations portion of this bill which were incorporated at the committee level. I thank all of my colleagues for giving us their suggestions, their requests, and their insights. It made for a better bill. As I mentioned, I am particularly grateful to Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Transportation-HUD Subcommittee, for his work. I also thank the staff for their diligence and commitment throughout this process. As Senator Reed mentioned, we worked extremely hard, but our staff worked even harder. So I thank Heideh Shahmoradi, Rajat Mathur, Jason Woolwine, Lydia Collins, Gus Maples, Dabney Hegg, Nathan Robinson, Christina Monroe, Jordan Stone, and Mike Clarke on the subcommittee staff. I also give special thanks to the floor and cloakroom staffs who worked so hard. Without the help of Laura Dove and her team and the team on the Democratic side, we could not be where we are today. They did a lot of the vetting that needed to be done on various amendments. They helped us in the negotiations and compromises that ultimately were included in this bill. I would note that our Transportation-HUD portion of this bill recognizes the fiscal reality while making critical investments into our crumbling infrastructure and economic development projects. It meets our responsibility to vulnerable populations. I think most of our colleagues are unaware that 84 percent of HUD's budget goes to subsidized housing. When we fund that, we keep very vulnerable low- income families, disabled individuals, and our low-income seniors from being at risk of homelessness. We also paid special attention in this bill to vulnerable homeless populations, such as our veterans and our young people. We continued a program the administration wanted to abolish that helps our homeless veterans, to whom we owe so much--$57 million in new vouchers, so that we can continue the progress we are making in housing our homeless veterans. Since we started this program, the number of homeless veterans has declined by about one-third. This program works, but we can't declare victory until the job is done. That is why both last year and this year we funded the program, even though the President's budget sought to eliminate it. We have made real investments in helping some of our most vulnerable young people, and those are youth who have been in the Foster Care Program and then age out of that program. In some cases, they are aging out of the program before they have even graduated from high school, and they have nowhere to go. So through family reunification vouchers and other programs, we are beefing up support so they don't fall through the cracks and become vulnerable to traffickers, to dropping out of school, to couch surfing, or ending up in shelters. In particular, I am very proud of the work we have done in that area. I am very pleased this bill funds the TIGER Grant Program at $525 million. This program has been extraordinarily popular and effective. It has funded projects in each and every State--projects that have led to job creation and economic development. When we think about it, at heart, much in this bill is about creating jobs and security for our fellow citizens. If you don't have a place to live, it is very difficult to show up for work every day. If the infrastructure is crumbling, it is very difficult for a business to hire the employees who produce the products and get those products to market. The construction projects this bill will fund creates good-paying jobs. In many ways, I think of this as a jobs bill. Let me give another example of a very popular program, the Community Development Block Grant Program. If you ask of the mayors and other town and city officials in your State, they will point to that program as one that gives them the flexibility to improve their downtowns, to make investments that bring new employers to the region, to build affordable housing, whatever their needs are, and that is the beauty of that program. It is not dictated from Washington. It gives tremendous flexibility to States and communities to design the kinds of economic development programs that boost growth and create jobs. In short, our bill strikes the right balance between thoughtful investment and fiscal restraint and thereby sets the stage for future economic growth, something I know the Presiding Officer has been a real leader in speaking out about and reminding us that must be our focus as Members of the Senate. I am also pleased we were able to bring spending bills to the floor for Members to examine, debate, and vote on in a transparent manner. The worst situation is when we do a series of continuing resolutions temporarily funding the essential functions of government. They create such uncertainty, they lock in priorities from previous years rather than reflecting today's priorities, and they end up costing more money. Agencies are unable to enter into contracts. Businesses, because of the uncertainty, tend to build in a little extra into their bids. It is a terrible way to operate. Equally bad is the practice of bundling all 12 of the appropriations bills into one gigantic omnibus bill, thousands of pages long, that is rushed through at the end of the fiscal year--or, more often, at the expiration of one of those continuing resolutions that I just deplore. We are not doing that this year. This is the third appropriations bill that the Senate has passed earlier than ever, with great cooperation from both sides of the aisle. The Members of the Appropriations Committee and its two leaders, Senator Cochran and Senator Mikulski, deserve great credit for putting us on a strict schedule and keeping the process moving. In fact, in the full committee today, we approved two more appropriations bills that are ready to come to the Senate floor. That is the way the process used to work. That is the way the process should work, and that is the way the process is working this year. I believe it is a great credit to the Senate, to the leaders of the Appropriations Committee, and to Majority Leader McConnell, who has made it a goal that all 12 bills be reported by the Appropriations Committee and brought to the Senate floor, individually or two or three combined, for full and open debate. Again, I thank Members on both sides of the aisle. Many of your requests are included in this important legislation. I feel fortunate to have worked with Senator Jack Reed on this bill. He is not only a great colleague and a terrific Senator but also a good friend. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3004-S3019] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I appreciate seeing the Presiding Officer in the chair and having a ``Corey'' represented and presiding over the U.S. Senate. I rise today to speak against an amendment now pending to this bill that would block a rule that seeks to fulfill the promise of the Fair Housing Act. This issue is very deeply personal to me and one that really has defined my own personal history. I would like to start by telling a story. In 1969, just 1 year after the passage of the Fair Housing Act, a couple here in Washington, DC, married with two boys, decided to move to New Jersey. In New Jersey, they encountered a lot of a practice called real estate steering, where Black couples were steered away from certain neighborhoods. Realizing they were being steered away from White neighborhoods, they grew frustrated, and they sought the help of the fair housing council. They set up an elaborate sting operation where my parents would go look at a home--or this couple would go look at a home--and they would then be followed by a White couple. The couple was told the house was sold or it was not for sale. The White couple would then appear and find out if that was, indeed, true. Most often for this couple from Washington, DC, yes, they would find out the house was still for sale. Eventually this couple found a house they loved in a small town called Harrington Park, NJ, but they were told that the house was not for sale. They were told the house had been pulled off the market or sold. They left. Then the White couple came behind them. Lo and behold, the house had not been sold or was not pulled off the market. The White couple pretended that they loved the house as the Black couple did and put a bid on the house. The bid was accepted. On the day of the closing, instead of the White couple showing up, the African-American gentleman from the Black couple and a volunteer lawyer came to confront the real estate agent. The real estate agent was so upset that he stood up and punched the lawyer representing the Black couple and sicced his dog on the African-American man. Yet the law was on their side. The fair housing law of the United States of America, the law of the Federal Government, was on their side. Eventually, that Black couple and their two kids moved into that home in Harrington Park, NJ. That was 1969. It was the year I was born, and that couple was my parents, Cary and Carolyn Booker. That is my origin story. Legislation that this body passed empowered my family to move into the home of their dreams in an all-White neighborhood with incredibly good schools that I went through from K-12. I am the beneficiary of work this body did to ensure that our American values are preserved, our values of inclusion and integration, to make sure fair housing is the law of the land. That work gave me my start in life. The activism of local activists, combined with the law of the land as passed by us, defined my path. After decades of struggle in communities across the country, we have largely been successful in banning overt housing discrimination. We [[Page S3005]] should be proud of our work. But legislation that we passed should not become a relic of history. It is not something for us to turn and admire. We all know on many issues the cause of freedom and the cause of justice necessitate constant vigilance. So I rise today with the knowledge that while major pieces of civil rights legislation like the Fair Housing Act have had a significant impact on millions of Americans--White, Black, Latino, Asian, disabled--this has had a full impact. We still have work to do to continue that vigilance to make sure that those values, those ideals, and the law of the land are made real for families. Unfortunately, for nearly 50 years there has not been real guidance, direction, or tools to help local officials achieve the goals of the Fair Housing Act, which are integrated housing, fair housing, equal access. In 2010, in fact, the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, failed to properly administer oversight obligations under the Fair Housing Act and failed to monitor its guarantees for compliance with the law. In 2013, HUD proposed affirmatively furthering fair housing, a new rule that would seek to fulfill the promise of the Fair Housing Act and eliminate a lot of the historic patterns of segregation that still go on in America today. The vision for the rule is to institute a data- driven analysis of localities and to develop Federal grant programs for housing and economic inclusion. When I was mayor, people came to me with passions and accusations and the like. I used to always say: In God we trust, but, everybody else, bring me data. It is important to look at the numbers to know what really is going on. So HUD brought about this idea of making sure we have that data--not in a rushed process. The administration engaged in a diligent 2-year rulemaking process with public inclusion, participation from others, and lots of public comment periods. They finalized that rule in July 2015. It is unfortunate that one of my dear colleagues--somebody whom I value very much because we do a lot of work across the aisle--has introduced an amendment that would block this rule's implementation, and I must respectfully disagree with the intent of this amendment. The Fair Housing Act and, really, the entirety of the Civil Rights Act were meant, again, to be real today, not just relics of yesterday. They were meant to be guideposts and standards by which we hold ourselves accountable for the values we put forth. The affirmatively further fair housing rule is a measure of accountability for HUD and for ourselves. You cannot change what you cannot measure. Let me say that again. I learned this as a manager: If you can't measure it, you can't change it or affect it. The rule will arm communities most in need with knowledge and numbers so they can make intelligent local decisions and best apply their resources. It is what everyone who has to manage something needs: accurate data. It will improve the access to quality data on local demographics and streamline the process for analyzing local fair housing impediments, helping grantees establish their own local fair housing priorities. This rule does not interfere with local zoning or housing laws, and it prevents further taxpayer dollars from being used to discriminate. Every stakeholder--every one of us--is afforded an opportunity to comment on the rule that HUD made, and, as a former local leader, it empowers people at the localities to do justice by their communities. This is a balanced and a measured rule, and it takes up the cause of the work to make our country more and more just. I know personally that so much of the character of our country comes from the values we have as a whole. There are rare times in our history where this body is called upon to affirm those values. This body's history--the noble history of this body--is something I have benefited from personally around fair housing. Now we have more tools necessary, with big data and analysis, to more effectively and affirmatively assert our values and ensure injustice is not being done. I want to make sure that we defeat this amendment for those reasons. I believe and know the values of my colleague who proposed this. I do not think it achieves the end that we want to see by disempowering people to try to help families like mine. I was a child in DC moving to New Jersey and found justice--found a pathway toward integration. Indeed, I doubt I would be here right now if it weren't for the laws of our land. I hope we can defeat this amendment and ensure that our Nation becomes more fair and more just and that more families like mine can find the America we hail when we pledge allegiance to the flag and say we are a Nation of liberty and justice for all. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum calls be charged equally, fairly--like fair housing--fairly, to both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized. The Appropriations Process Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senators have been working diligently this week, continuing our efforts to advance American priorities and responsibly fund important programs through the appropriations process. We have made good progress so far. The Senate already passed one funding bill by a broad majority at a record early time. Another Appropriations subcommittee approved its own funding bill just the other day, and it is my hope that we will be able to move two more funding measures across the finish line very shortly. With continued work and cooperation, we can do just that. The two measures before us are the result of hard work, negotiation, and compromise. They are the product of strong leadership by Senators Collins and Kirk, and they are the culmination of a good deal of input from both sides of the aisle. Here is what we know these bills can achieve: The transportation and housing infrastructure appropriations bill will invest in our transportation systems and help ensure safety and efficiency. The veterans and military construction funding bill will help improve care for veterans and increase oversight and accountability efforts at the VA. The legislation before us will also include a provision to help address Zika. This compromise provision will focus on immediate needs while also providing resources for longer term goals such as a vaccine. It is another reminder that keeping Americans safe and healthy is a top priority for us all. Let's continue our work today to move these important funding measures closer to passage. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3897 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, a home is more than just a roof over someone's head; it is actually where a family builds their lives. In our country, we need to do everything we can to make sure families have options when it comes to finding a place to live, and they need access to affordable, safe, and fair housing. Unfortunately, today Republicans want to deal a significant blow to fair housing. The amendment they are offering would tear down the civil rights protections in the Fair Housing Act of 1968, and I am here today to strongly urge my colleagues to vote against it. Before the civil rights movement, African Americans faced an enormous amount of injustice and racism in housing. People of color were often relegated to substandard housing. They were denied mortgages, and rent in an [[Page S3006]] African-American neighborhood was often higher than rent in a White neighborhood. When the Fair Housing Act went into effect in 1968, it not only banned discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing, it went a step further: A new Federal housing agency was charged with proactively rooting out discrimination and segregation in communities across the country. That is an important part of the law because today people across the country still face systemic and sometimes racially motivated barriers to housing. People with disabilities, people of color, families with children, and religious groups in many areas have limited housing choices. Last year the Department of Housing and Urban Development, also known as HUD, issued a long-overdue rule to help carry out that mission to proactively eliminate housing segregation and discrimination. For States and local governments that get HUD investments, this rule would improve the quality and access to data on demographics, it would help researchers analyze the barriers people face to access fair housing, and it would help set priorities and goals for carrying out the mission to actively fight back against discrimination and segregation. Based on pilot programs from around the country, we know this rule can help expand opportunity to more Americans. One of those pilots was in Seattle in my home State of Washington. After an assessment of high- poverty areas in Puget Sound, the city saw that neighborhoods that historically have been disenfranchised lacked job opportunities. Armed with that data, the city is setting up a food distribution center and a job incubator in those neighborhoods. The city's work is helping to foster job growth in places where low-income residents live, and through that work, the city expanded economic security to more people. That would not have been possible without the data this long-overdue rule provided us. This is the kind of success this new rule will help further, but unfortunately we are seeing that some Republicans want to put a stop to those positive changes and backtrack on the gains we have made on civil rights in housing, and to me, that is unacceptable. Here in Congress, we should be clearing pathways for more Americans to access more housing, not blocking the away. I am here today to urge my colleagues to vote against that amendment, which we will be voting on later. Mr. President, while I have the floor, I wish to talk about another topic that is very important to me. I am very honored to come to the floor today with good news for thousands of military families, including three couples I met just last week here in the Nation's Capital. Each of the veterans I met with had suffered a catastrophic injury while fighting for our country, which changed the course of their lives and their families' lives forever. Matt Keil was shot by a sniper and paralyzed. Kevin Jaye was injured by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Tyler Black was paralyzed during a firefight. What was the one thing each of these veterans wished for after he returned home and got out of the hospital? Well, like so many women and men in our country, they dreamed of having a family of their own. Even though each veteran suffered injuries that made it nearly impossible to conceive naturally, they have hope because in this day and age, the medical technology exists to make their dream of having a family come true. The most popular path is in vitro fertilization, known as IVF, but because of a policy enacted decades ago, the VA is barred from covering the costs of IVF, which forced Matt, Kevin, and Tyler, with their partners, to go down that road alone even though their injuries were caused while serving all of us overseas. Collectively, they have paid tens and tens of thousands of dollars out- of-pocket. Matt said to me that when he heard the VA wouldn't cover the one medical procedure he and his wife wanted so badly, he felt like his country had abandoned him. We are talking about a man who sacrificed his body for our country. I believe this is wrong. When this country sends brave men and women to work, we promise to take care of them when they return home. That is why I have been fighting to change this policy once and for all, and today I am very proud to see this effort take a big step forward with bipartisan support here in the Senate. My provision in the underlying VA appropriations bill will finally allow the VA to cover those costs and let our veterans know their country is there for them when they come home. It is the right thing to do for Matt and his wife Tracy, Kevin and Lauren, Tyler and Crystal, and every other military family in this country. As we move to pass this bill through the Senate, I call on my colleagues in the House to follow suit and get this done. This is not about politics or partisanship, and we shouldn't be cutting corners when it comes to our veterans and their families. This is a chance to support our veterans and the dreams they have fought so hard for--to have a family. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3900, as Modified Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I call for regular order with respect to the Blunt amendment No. 3900. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending. Mr. LEE. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise not to debate the broad question of the Federal Government's proper role in protecting and advancing public health; instead, I am here to stress to my colleagues that with a growing national debt that will soon exceed $20 trillion, we cannot continue spending money we don't have. If this emergency supplemental measure is adopted, it will be the 15th emergency supplemental we have passed since 2006, totaling about $190 billion in deficit spending. This is not how responsible governments budget. It is not how responsible governments behave. Indeed, we have the ability to provide the resources the country needs to fight the Zika virus without adding to our national debt. For starters, we can undo the $500 million President Obama took from the international infectious diseases account which was placed in his unapproved Green Climate Fund. USAID is sitting on $1.2 billion in unobligated Ebola funds. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response currently has $347 million not being put to use. There is $525 million in CDC's global health security agenda that is unspoken for. To the extent that the Zika virus is truly an emergency, one that deserves the Federal Government's attention, we already have more than enough unused emergency funds to pay for the fight against this emerging threat. Yesterday, my colleague, the distinguished junior senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Lankford, illustrated that this administration has tens of billions of dollars in unobligated discretionary funds to pay for this as well. What we should not do, however, is allow the Zika virus to be yet another excuse to run up the national debt, just so appropriators can come back and use unspent emergency money on nonemergency parochial priorities at some later date. The entire emergency spending label is to some, perhaps, a little bit misleading. It does not mean that the money gets spent any faster. All it does is give Congress the ability to spend the money without having to pay for it, to spend the money without having to offset it somewhere else. That is not how we should operate. I urge my colleagues to uphold this budget point of order. Mr. President, pursuant to section 314(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I raise a point of order against all of the emergency designations contained in amendment No. 3900, a list of which I am sending to the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I certainly share the deep concern expressed by my colleague from Utah over the growing size of the Federal debt. It is a serious problem. I encourage him to look at the chart that Senator Alexander has produced, which shows where the problem is. [[Page S3007]] The problem is on the mandatory side of the budget, not the discretionary side of the budget, which, due to efforts we have made, has been held relatively flat for several years. But the mandatory spending side of the budget is soaring. There is no doubt about that. For example, many of us, when the administration presented its budget, rejected the gimmicks that were included, for example, in the transportation budget to shift some $7 billion from discretionary to mandatory spending. That was unwarranted. We did not do that. But if ever there were an emergency, it is the threat posed to public health by the Zika virus. About 2 weeks ago, Senator Johnny Isakson and I went to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA, and heard briefings from the top experts in the world about the threat posed by the Zika virus. The fact is that the news keeps getting worse and worse. Zika has now been linked for certain to a severe kind of birth defect, making pregnant women particularly at risk. It has also been linked to a disease known as Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause paralysis and even death. Those of us who live in Northern States--this kind of mosquito, for example, is found only in the very southern tip of Maine--should take no comfort from that fact. The CDC has documented cases of the Zika virus in virtually every State in the Union, and that is because disease knows no boundaries in this world of international travel. In addition, the CDC has documented approximately 1,000 cases of Zika. It is an epidemic in Puerto Rico, where there are more than 475 documented cases--a true crisis for that U.S. territory. From my perspective, we have to act. We have to act quickly. The Blunt-Murray compromise bill deserves the emergency designation which is attached to it. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget regulations, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the Blunt-Murray amendment No. 3900, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I believe we are going to have that vote a little bit later. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Amendment No. 4039 Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, last night I was off the floor when Senator McCain of Arizona offered an amendment regarding the Veterans Choice bill. Before the decision is made, I wish to memorialize my support for the McCain amendment. As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, we waived jurisdiction so it could be offered on the VA component of this bill. I wish to add one further comment. The cost associated with extending the eligibility of Veterans Choice by 3 years, which is the McCain amendment, scores at a cost. But to recognize that cost, you have to assume we would not have treated an eligible veteran under any other program if Choice expired. We are never going to abandon our veterans. We have a commitment to the veterans for the health care they have signed up for. What Senator McCain is doing is trying to improve access to health care and to maintain access through the choice of a private sector provider or through a VA provider. There is no additional cost, unless you assume that you want to take away a benefit that we gave 2 years ago in the omnibus that we passed. I commend Senator McCain for extending the eligibility for Choice for 3 more years. I will support the amendment when it comes before the Senate, and I encourage all other Members to do the same. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote in relation to H.R. 2577. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on this amendment, I yield back the remainder of our time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time is yielded back. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 3946) was agreed to. Amendment No. 3900, as Modified, as Amended The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3900, offered by the majority leader for Mr. Blunt and Mrs. Murray. The Senator from Missouri. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, we have looked at the proposal. I think we have reached an agreement on the proposal that takes this issue up through September of next year. I think now is the time to move forward. I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment, and at that point we will work with the House for a final conclusion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that Republicans refused to work with us to fully fund the President's emergency supplemental proposal, and it shouldn't have taken us so long to get to this point, but I am pleased that this will move us to a down payment on the President's emergency funding package through the Senate. [[Page S3008]] I want to commend Chairman Blunt for his work with us on this and all the Democrats and Republicans who are supporting it. But I want to remind all of us, this is only a first step, and we have to make sure that this agreement gets through the House and to the President's desk in the least amount of time. I hope we can separate it from this bill and move it quickly. That was objected to yesterday over pay-fors, which are not part of this amendment, but this is a critical emergency. We need to move on this first step, and I hope we can do it in a timely manner. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. VITTER.

Amendment No. 4039 Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his tremendous effort on behalf of veterans and the different approaches he has used. I don't think anybody has worked harder on it or understands it better. I wish there were more we could do for veterans and will work with him to see that that happens, but this amendment isn't the right place to do it. This amendment proposes that we increase overspending by $7.7 billion for a continuation of the Veterans Choice Program. It doesn't offer badly needed reforms to the program, it simply provides more funding. Unfortunately, the accountability measures currently in place at the VA do not go far enough in ensuring that the health care needs of our veterans are the priority. By extending the Choice Program, we would be extending problematic waiting periods, we would be extending a backlog of health care claims, and we would be giving little or no authority to the VA to manage its employees. We have been getting complaints about many of these things, and another veterans proposal in the Senate improves both health care access for veterans and expanded disciplinary [[Page S3009]] measures at the VA. Senator McCain has worked on that as well. At the same time, it provides offsets to ensure that we continue to help our veterans in the future. I have been concerned about what I thought was $6 billion of emergency expense every year. I had them actually total that up in the committee and found out that we do $26.1 billion a year in emergency spending. We are going to have to find that money somewhere because if we don't provide offsets, we will not be able to help our veterans or our military or our education or anything else. Continued spending without making responsible choices for priorities will put us in a real hole. In order to make sure we are spending on our priorities, such as national defense and our veterans, and that they are not crowded out, I raise a point of order. Mr. President, pursuant to section 314(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I raise a point of order against the emergency designation found on page 3, lines 7 through 12, of amendment No. 4039 to H.R. 2577, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note with some interest that the Senator from Wyoming did not have the same zeal for the $1.1 billion that we just passed in emergency spending for Zika that is not paid for, but the important issue is, that this is a program for 1.4 million appointments for veterans who would otherwise wait for delayed care, over 2.5 million separate payments to doctors, 450,000 Choice health care providers--the list goes on and on. All I am asking for is an extension of a program that is in effect and helping our veterans. The fact is, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee said last night: What Senator McCain is trying to do to improve access to health care is maintain the access through the choice of a private sector provider or VA provider. There is no additional cost unless you assume that you want to take away a benefit that was given 2 years ago in the omnibus bill we passed. He goes on to say he would support this amendment. Who is taking advantage? The majority of the people who are taking advantage of this Choice Card, I will tell the Senator from Wyoming, are the young men and women who are just returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. We are giving them a choice. We are giving them a choice to be able to get the care they need and deserve. In my home State of Arizona, 50 veterans died while on a nonexistent waiting list--50 of them. That is why we have a Choice Card, so they can go out and get the care they need and want and not be on a nonexistent waiting list. I don't know what the priorities are of the Senator from Wyoming, but I can tell him now, they are not mine, and they are not of the men and women who are serving this Nation who deserve the best care and the choice of going to the provider that they want to within certain parameters. This is simply an extension of a program that is in existence that cares for our men and women who served our Nation with sacrifice, and some of them didn't even come back to have a chance to have a Choice Card. Mr. President, I ask to waive the budget point of order. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable budget resolutions for the purposes of my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 84, nays 14, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 79 Leg.] YEAS--84 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Blunt Booker Boozman Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Cochran Collins Coons Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Moran Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Portman Reed Reid Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Schatz Schumer Scott Shaheen Stabenow Tester Thune Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--14 Barrasso Coats Corker Cornyn Durbin Enzi Lankford Lee Murkowski Paul Perdue Sessions Shelby Sullivan NOT VOTING--2 Cruz Sanders The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 84, the nays are 14. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to, and the point of order falls. The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 1:45 p.m. be equally divided between the two managers or their designees and that at 1:45 p.m. the Senate vote in relation to the Collins amendment No. 3970 and the Lee amendment No. 3897; further, that following disposition of the Lee amendment, all postcloture time be expired; that the substitute amendment, as amended, be adopted; that the cloture motion on the underlying bill be withdrawn, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the issue that was just brought up dealing with veterans funding and specifically the Choice Program. Three years ago, Congress put into place a response to what was happening in VA centers all over the country. We were all appalled with what was happening at VA centers all over the country. But for any of us who are in congressional offices, we were aware, were pushing on this issue, and had pushed on this issue for a while. But the media exposed what we all saw, and that was long-secret waiting lists for veterans so that the VA centers could keep their positive numbers up and look better--months of waiting for things that would take days across the street. As I dealt with the VA center in my own city, at times it would take 6 months to get a knee replacement surgery at the VA center, when at the great hospital directly across the street, they could get that same surgery within 2 days. As to hearing aids, it would take months and months to actually go through the process and to get them at our VA centers. As to cancer care, if you were diagnosed with cancer and had needs and treatment that was going to be required, they would literally send you across the country, sometimes more than 2,000 miles away, to actually get cancer treatment--away from your family. Congress responded to that by putting into place the Choice Act. It was an emergency. There were major problems that were happening around the country in multiple VA centers, and there had to be a response right then. Congress set aside emergency funding and an emergency response to make sure something came into existence that only loosely existed before. What was called community care was now clarified to say that this is Choice, and it was simple. If a veteran had to wait [[Page S3010]] more than 30 days to get into an appointment or get treatment or if they lived more than 40 miles from a VA center, they would be given the option to go wherever they wanted to go. VA was required to start working relationships in every community across the country so that veterans would have the option to go wherever they wanted to go. I would acknowledge that program is in its infancy. It is 2 years old at this point. It has a ways to go to be perfected. There are still problems with it, and there is a constant push from Congress to provide accountability to make sure that program is done and done well. That should be the first step in giving veterans real choice. The first step of that is 30 days or 40 miles. The second step of that is any VA- eligible veteran would get a card and they could go to anyplace that accepts Medicare. If they accept Medicare anywhere in the country--any lab, any hospital, any doctor--they should also be able to receive veterans as well. So veterans can go wherever they choose to go regardless of the distance. I have veterans who drive past six great hospitals, drive 200 miles to get to a VA center, and their families have the burden of all of that travel. It should not be that way. Veterans should be able to go wherever they choose to go for care. So the Choice Program is not only a good program, it is the right direction to go and it is a positive first step. But here is the problem: The way this particular amendment has come up, it is not only not germane to this bill because it deals with something that started 3 years ago and we are dealing with a new bill right now, but it is also an issue of, we are doing the right thing the wrong way. My staff has heard me say this over and over again: There is a right thing to do and there is a right way to do it. Three years ago, we knew this was an issue. Three years ago, the planning should have been put in place to put this into the normal appropriations process. This process puts it into place, so we are adding $7.5 billion onto our children for a program that should be in the normal appropriations process that was started 3 years ago and that is not an emergency anymore. This is not an emergency. This is now normal funding of a program we want to keep going and expand. So there is a big issue here we do have to resolve. I want to see us do the Choice Program and do it right, but there is a right thing to do and a right way to do it. This program is already fully funded through the next year. It is not an emergency. It is in place, funded, and ready to go. It doesn't go away in the next year, all the way through the fiscal year. Let's put it in the normal process, let's do it the right way, and let's not add $7 billion to our children for an emergency that is actually a year away. No one is going to convince me that in a $4 trillion budget, there are not areas we could cut. Earlier this week I identified $86 billion in funds that are available to cover the $1 billion for Zika that this Congress decided to do in emergency funding anyway. We have the funds available. We can honor our veterans. We can do this and also honor our children. At the same time we are honoring our veterans, let's honor the next generation and make sure we are not adding debt to the next generation. With that, Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the McCain amendment No. 4039 is not germane to the Collins amendment No. 3896, as amended, or H.R. 2577. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained, and the amendment falls. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support my VA spending bill to final passage. It is a very bipartisan bill. I also would like to thank my ranking Democratic member, Senator Jon Tester of Montana, who has been a great partner. We have worked with all Senators on both sides of the aisle to include their priorities and have worked through dozens of amendments. We include more than two dozen amendments in this bill. The bill provides record funding for our veterans' health care, protects whistleblowers, includes opioid safety, and also has the RAID Act to clean up the VA so that cockroaches are not in the VA kitchens and dining facilities. This bill also adds 100 staff to the IG's office and combats veteran homelessness. It requires better screening of VA doctors so they can't switch from State to State. The bill also increases medical research and adds money for health care for our veterans. I thank the subcommittee staff for doing outstanding work this year, and that includes Tina Evans, Chad Schulken, Michael Bain, Robert Henke, D'Ann Lettieri, Patrick Magnuson, and Carlos Elias. The bottom line: This bill does right by our troops and does right by our veterans. I thank my Senate colleagues and urge its rapid adoption. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to voice my full support for the fiscal year 2017 Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies appropriations bill which includes the fiscal year 2017 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and related agencies appropriations bill. Each of these bills was passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee by a vote of 30-0 last month. I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan package of bills. I commend Senators Collins and Reed for their hard work on the T-HUD bill and their collegiality on the floor this week managing this bill. T-HUD is our annual jobs bill making investments at the State and local level, delivering on America's physical infrastructure needs and America's compelling human needs. The bill before us will keep our roads and transportation systems safe and in good repair while preserving housing assistance for our Nation's most in need. I am especially proud of Senators Collins and Reed for making renewed investments in lead paint poison prevention. As the Maryland Senator from Baltimore, this is an issue I know all too well. Senator Kit Bond and I worked together on the VA-HUD bill to first bring attention to this crippling public health problem. April 19 marked the anniversary of Freddie Gray's death, a young man who grew up in Baltimore's low- income housing. Before Freddie's second birthday, his blood lead levels were seven times the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's suggested level, leaving Freddie severely and permanently brain damaged. Today there are still half a million children under the age of 6 with lead poisoning. This bill increases lead prevention funding in three programs. First, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes is funded at $135 million, an increase of $25 million to support lead-based paint hazard reductions in 1,750 additional units. This program provides safer homes for more than 6,200 people. Second, the Mikulski-Bond Lead Hazard Reduction Demo Program is funded at $55 million, an increase of $10 million. This program provides competitive funds to State and local governments to implement lead hazardous reduction programs in privately owned and owner-occupied housing. Third, the Public Housing Capital Fund is funded at $1.9 billion, an increase of $25 million. This will remediate 1,500 public housing units. This bill also includes a number of reforms to HUD's lead programs. Among these is the requirement for HUD to update its blood level standard to the stronger Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standard. HUD's standard hasn't been updated since 1999. In addition, the bill makes studio and efficiency apartments eligible for remediation grants for the first time. It is estimated that 34,000 zero-bedroom dwellings house children under 6 years old. The transportation portion of this bill makes significant investments in Maryland's highways, byways, and transit systems. It cuts the first check under the FAST Act passed last December. This means more formula funding for every State. For Maryland, that is an increase of $62 million. For transit, this bill provides increased funding for the Federal Transit [[Page S3011]] Administration totaling $575 million. It includes the Job Corridor- Purple Line project in the Washington suburbs of Maryland. A total of $125 million is provided for the construction of this light rail project. For the DC Metro system, this bill provides the eighth installment of $150 million in Federal dedicated funding. This is the fully authorized level and will be matched dollar for dollar by the three jurisdictions. Fighting for this annual appropriation was the promise I made and have kept since the deadly Fort Totten crash in June 2009. This funding must be used on capital improvements relating to safety including buying new rail cars, track improvements, and signal upgrades. I included bill language requiring the U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary to do three things before this funding money can be spent. First, the Secretary must approve each expenditure. Second, the Secretary must certify Metro is making progress implementing FTA's safety and financial management corrective actions. Third, the Secretary must determine that Metro is using this money for top safety priorities. In addition to this dedicated funding, I am proud of the safety amendment I introduced with Senators Shelby, Cardin, Warner, Kaine, and Brown that was passed earlier in the week. This amendment provides additional funding to FTA to expand its safety oversight workforce for a total increase of $5.25 million over the current year funding level. It will enable FTA to hire six full-time employees for Metro's Rail Operations Control Center, four more investigators, seven additional inspectors, and six more contractors. This additional funding means FTA will now have more inspectors to watch as Metro crews work to complete SafeTrack, the yearlong plan to accelerate repairs on the system. Inspectors will be there to make sure the track work is fixed the right way for good. FTA also will have safety staff at the Rail Operations Control Center 24 hours a day and 7 days a week making sure emergency procedures are followed to prevent future incidents. FTA staff will help Metro implement the National Transportation Safety Board's recent recommendations to overhaul the center's emergency operations and training. FTA staff will make sure these reforms remain in place and are followed. Finally, more investigators will help FTA tackle approximately 100 Metro investigations conducted each year. I also want to say a few words about the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. This is another bipartisan bill funding vital programs for the health and well-being of our Nation's veterans, troops, and their families developed by Senators Kirk and Tester. Overall, this bill provides $83 billion in discretionary funding which is an increase of $3.2 billion above the current year funding level. This bill fully funds VA Medical Services at the President's request of $52.8 billion. This is $1 billion over what we advanced last year to address increased demand for VA medical care both within and outside the VA health care system. The bill provides additional funding for disability claims processing. Significant progress has been made to eliminate the backlog in processing initial claims, but unfortunately, the backlog in appeals is rapidly building. This bill includes $2.9 billion for claims processing, $30 million above the request, to hire 300 new claims processors and 240 additional employees for the Board of Veterans Appeals. Also included is an increase of $46 million for the Board of Veterans Appeals, bringing their total funding to $156 million. This will provide for hiring an additional 240 new employees focused on appeals processing. For our women veterans, this bill makes significant strides bring parity between male and female veterans. This bill mandates that the VA research and acquire prosthetic devices specifically designed for women. It includes $5.3 billion overall to treat more than 500,000 female veterans who get care through the VA. This bill targets $535 million for gender-specific health care which is $20 million over the request and nearly $70 million over the current funding level. This includes gynecology, reproductive health, and mental health care for women. I also was proud to support Senator Murray's amendment in committee, allowing the VA to cover the cost of reproductive services for veterans who suffered service-related injuries that prevent them from starting families. The military construction part of this bill fully funds all seven Maryland projects included in the President's budget request. This means a total of $340 million for construction jobs at Fort Meade, Pax River, Joint Base Andrews, and Bethesda Medical Center. Finally, the bill includes $1.1 billion in emergency spending to combat the urgent Zika crisis. CDC, NIH, and USAID need this funding on the ground today. $1.1 billion is a bottom line, not a starting point for negotiation. I am committed to sending a Zika supplemental to the President as soon as possible. I urge all of my colleagues to support this package of bills. It meets many compelling human needs and physical infrastructure needs of our nation and does not include poison pill riders. It is an example of how, working together, we can solve problems and put America to work. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to speak in support of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs division of the substitute before us. I commend Chairman Kirk and Ranking Member Tester for their leadership in crafting the fiscal year 2017 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs funding bill. As a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, I have appreciated their steady, strong advocacy for our Nation's veterans, servicemembers, and their families. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I know well the sacrifices of those who serve and have served on our behalf, as well as the sacrifices made by their families. The vital programs and benefits funded by this bill will help fulfill our obligations to them and honor their commitment to our Nation. While we can never fully repay these debts, we must strive to provide each veteran with the quality health care that they deserve. One way this bill helps to meet this goal is through the extension it would provide of the highly successful Access Received Closer to Home, or ARCH, program. This pilot program, which is scheduled to expire in August, serves rural veterans in northern Maine, Montana, Kansas, Virginia, and Arizona, providing them access to high quality care in their communities and near their families. Many of my constituents tell me that this program has proven to be a lifeline for them and has saved them the arduous burden of traveling up to 600 miles round trip to receive care at the Togus VA Medical Center in Augusta, ME. In Maine, the program not only reduces wait times for appointments and prevents veterans from going through a third-party administrator to receive care, but it is cost effective. According to the VA's own statistics, the average cost of ARCH per veteran in Maine is less than half the average cost for VHA direct care. More than 90 percent of ARCH veterans are overwhelmingly satisfied with their care, a testament to why ARCH should be a model for the Nation. Ensuring that veterans continue to receive this seamless care is paramount, and I thank Chairman Kirk and Ranking Member Tester for including an extension of this vital program in the fiscal year 2017 funding legislation. I am also pleased that this legislation would fund the President's fiscal year 2017 request for VA medical leases, including funding to lease a new Community Based Outpatient Clinic--CBOC--facility in Portland, ME. This project would allow VA to consolidate and colocate the Saco and Portland CBOCs with Maine Medical Center and its affiliate, the Tufts University School of Medicine. This collaboration will provide primary care, mental health, women's health, and specialty care medical services for veterans. This legislation would also help to address the opioid epidemic by requiring the Department to improve appropriate pain care for veterans. It also includes programs to help end veteran homelessness, expand care services focused on our growing population of female veterans, and support caregivers, who shoulder the enormous responsibility of caring for veterans who are unable to care for themselves [[Page S3012]] Finally, I want to highlight the funding included in this legislation for our Nation's civilian and military members--and their families--who serve at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME. The legislation includes $74.9 million for housing, the replacement of the medical and dental clinic, and utility nuclear improvements. These projects will help provide the exceptional personnel at PNSY with the facilities they need and deserve to carry out the mission. Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their excellent work in balancing the priorities within their bill, and I urge my colleagues to advance this important legislation. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, universal, safe, and consistent trucking regulations are vital to all aspects of the trucking industry and to all users of the national highway system. Ensuring highway safety must remain a priority of this body. It also remains critical that this body maintain predictable safety laws to sustain efficient outcomes for truckers, trucking companies, the manufacturers and growers of the goods that trucks transport, and the customers who buy the products. Congress determined years ago that a uniform system of Federal trucking rules would lead to safer and more productive outcomes than a 50-State patchwork of trucking regulations, as goods are often transported across State lines. Despite Congress's intentions, we are seeing various State trucking rules being implemented across the country that stray from the Federal guidelines. We need to figure out how to address this. We need to make sure that we have commonsense rules that don't change every time a driver crosses a State line while continuing to protect truck drivers and road users from unsafe situations. I think we have got a little more work to do before we are ready for a solution, but I pledge to work with all who are willing and maybe we can figure something out in the coming months. Thank you. Maritime Security Program Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I join today with my good friend, Senator Hirono, to address the requirement for full authorized funding of the Maritime Security Program. Senator Hirono and I serve together on the Seapower Subcommittee and firmly believe that this program is important to our national security. The United States needs a U.S.-flag merchant marine that is strong, active, competitive, and useful to the military. Our merchant marine has a long history of providing sealift support to our Armed Forces for global military operations. The Maritime Security Program is a unique public-private partnership that helps the merchant marine, enhancing America's commercial sealift capability while saving the American taxpayer billions of dollars. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Seapower Subcommittee, I could not agree more with the Senator from Mississippi's views concerning the importance of the MSP program. The 60-ship MSP program is the most prudent and economical means to address the U.S. military's current and projected sealift requirements. A 2006 report prepared for the Military Sealift Committee of the National Defense Transportation Association concluded that ``the likely cost to the government to replicate just the vessel capacity provided by the MSP dry cargo vessels would be $13 billion.'' In addition, the U.S. Transportation Command, TransCom, has estimated that it would cost the U.S. Government an additional $52 billion to replicate the ``global intermodal system'' that is made available to the Department of Defense, DOD, by MSP participants. In contrast, MSP participants now provide DOD with the same vessels and global intermodal system at a fraction of what it would cost our government to do the job itself. Mr. WICKER. The Senate version of the Transportation-HUD Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2017 includes $275 million for the Maritime Security Program. This is an increase of $65 million above the enacted level for fiscal year 2016. Although we are pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee has recommended this increase in funding, we hasten to point out that Congress acted last December to increase the authorization level for the Maritime Security Program to $299,997,000 for fiscal year 2017. The House Appropriations Committee has recommended funding for the next fiscal year that would meet this authorization. As this appropriations bill works its way through Congress, we urge the chairs and ranking members of the Transportation-HUD Appropriations Subcommittees and the full Appropriations Committee to work in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to provide funding for the Maritime Security Program at its fully authorized level of $299,997,000 for fiscal year 2017. Ms. HIRONO. I strongly agree with Senator Wicker. Despite the clear benefits the MSP program provides, the MSP commercial fleet is under extreme economic pressure from reductions in government-impelled cargoes and foreign competitive factors. I completely share the concerns expressed by the then-TransCom commander, GEN Paul Selva, in his March 2015 testimony before the Armed Services Committee, where he stated that the ``reduction in government impelled cargoes due to the drawdown in Afghanistan and reductions in food aid . . .are driving vessel owners to reflag to non-U.S.-flag out of economic necessity . . .With the recent vessel reductions, the mariner base is at the point where future reductions in U.S.-flag capacity puts our ability to fully activate, deploy and sustain forces at increased risk.'' Accordingly, to ensure that this essential U.S. commercial sealift capability provided by the MSP program remains available to meet America's national security requirements, the MSP program needs to be fully funded as authorized by the Congress. Mr. WICKER. I would like to add a comment from the current TransCom commander, GEN Darren McDew. In January, General McDew said, ``As a military professional and senior leader, I think about and plan for what the future may hold, and I would tell you we must prepare for the real possibility we will not enjoy the uncontested seas and broad international support experienced in 1991. If either of those possibilities becomes reality, and if we remain committed to responding to security incidents around the globe, the only way of guaranteeing we decisively meet our national objectives is with U.S. ships operated by U.S. mariners.'' I thank Senator Hirono for joining me in this effort to ensure that full funding is secured for the Maritime Security Program in fiscal year 2017. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. U.S. Innovation and Competitiveness Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the need to drive innovation and competitiveness here in the United States. I vividly remember watching the Apollo missions on TV and the launch of that 36-story tall Saturn V rocket that took Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the surface of the Moon. The space program not only inspired a generation of Americans, but it also led to incredible advances in science and technology that over the last 50 years have accounted for as much as half of all the economic growth in the United States. These groundbreaking advances firmly established our Nation as an international leader in innovation. During the height of the space race, America's Federal investment in research and development reached nearly 2 percent of the Nation's GDP. Today, overall Federal R&D spending--the seed corn of our future prosperity--has fallen to a historic low of 0.78 percent of GDP. With the United States investing less on science, research, and education, and our competitors outpacing us, we are losing our footing in the global marketplace. Congress must increase the Federal investment in R&D to 1 percent of GDP if we want to continue to be leading the world in innovation. This commitment should include a focus on increased Federal support for basic research--an essential component of any kind of innovation economy. [[Page S3013]] In addition to increased investment, we in Congress need to implement policy solutions that will reassert American leadership internationally. We need to invest in what works. We need to listen to the innovators, academic leaders, and industries that are making the life-changing inventions of the future a reality. To that end, my colleague Senator Cory Gardner and I have convened a series of roundtable discussions on ways to improve the American innovation system. Just last week, our Commerce Committee leaders, Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson, held a productive hearing on ways to leverage the U.S. science and technology enterprise. After receiving input from industry, academia, science organizations, and economic development organizations, Senators Thune, Nelson, Gardner, and I are working to develop new legislation to guide our Nation's research priorities in the coming years and to improve America's innovation system. Through these roundtables, we heard that the stakeholder community agrees that modest, sustained, and predictable increases in Federal research and development investments are absolutely critical to ensuring the economic competitiveness of the United States. We need continued Federal investment in basic research, while also providing opportunities to commercialize that research. There is basic research that our companies simply cannot afford to conduct, making Federal investment absolutely critical. We also need to work to reduce administrative burdens on researchers so that we can maximize our Federal research investment. We need that investment to be put into the lab and not filling out more paperwork. We need stronger partnerships between government, the private sector, and academia in order to capitalize on discoveries emerging from our world-class research universities, such as the University of Michigan, Wayne State University, and Michigan State University. We must also close the significant employment gap in the STEM workforce for women and underrepresented minorities. Women make up less than 50 percent of post-bachelor STEM degree programs and only about one-quarter of the STEM workforce. Underrepresented minorities, including Hispanics and African Americans, make up about 10 percent of the science and engineering workforce. Last month, I joined a number of my colleagues in introducing the STEM Opportunities Act, legislation that would improve inclusion of women, minorities, and people with disabilities in STEM careers. It is a top priority for me to see that a similar provision is included in our bipartisan legislation. Finally, if we want to continue to be a leader in the global economy, we need to be a nation that makes things. Michigan is a State that builds and grows things, and I will continue to fight to make sure we continue doing that. Investments in advanced manufacturing will support firms of all sizes and support good-paying jobs and help keep them here in the United States. That is why it is one of my top priorities for this legislation that we ensure American manufacturing companies can compete and succeed in the highly competitive global marketplace. Last month, I joined my colleagues, Senators Coons and Ayotte, to introduce the bipartisan Manufacturing Extension Partnership Improvement Act. The Manufacturing Extension Program, or MEP, is a Federal public-private partnership that helps businesses get their products to market through a variety of consulting services. The MEP Improvement Act would expand and improve the MEP Program to serve small- and medium-sized manufacturing companies, which are a critical part of our economy and our national competitiveness. Including key components of the MEP Improvement Act will be a top priority for me in the new legislation being drafted. Science and technology are inseparable from the American competitiveness ecosystem. However, we need to focus on the entire ecosystem--from STEM, or STEAM, to basic research, to application and commercialization--and the inspiration that drives ambitious endeavors like exploring space and the other frontiers of science. We in Congress must do our part by supporting and investing in our efforts to drive economic growth, unleash increased productivity, enhance our safety and security, and make the world a better place for future generations. We are facing big challenges as a Nation, but I am committed to working with everyone--Democrats, Republicans, industry, academia, workers, students, and employers--to increase investments and implement the solutions that will ensure American competitiveness and create more good-paying jobs here in the United States. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if there is one specialty that every Member of Congress has, it is air travel. We spend more time on airplanes, more time in airports, more time waiting for flights and worrying about flights than most other Americans. As Members of Congress, we are veterans of air travel. We have all seen the footage of people waiting to go through security screening at major airports, particularly in the city of Chicago at both O'Hare and Midway. The lines are so long that people have had to wait 2 to 3 hours--2 to 3 hours to go through a security checkpoint. People are angry, and I don't blame them. Thousands of people have missed their flights, and some were stuck sleeping in airports overnight. The commissioner of aviation, Ginger Evans, told me: We pulled out the cots that we save for snow emergencies so that people now, in the heat of early summer, are facing the same kinds of delays. Our highest priority is to protect those who travel on our airplanes. Poor planning and inadequate funding have led to alarming delays across airports in America, and in Chicago we have felt it more than most. More needs to be done to fix the problem. That is what I have been working to do. Earlier this week, I talked to the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on the phone about the next steps. Yesterday, I followed up with a call to TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger to hear his thoughts. We all agree that the real problem is the shortage of TSA screeners. More people need to be hired and trained so security lines can stay open and people can move through the checkpoints faster. In the meantime, there are immediate steps we need to take in Chicago. First, we are going to get 58 more TSA screening officers in the next 2 weeks and 224 by August. That is about a 15-percent increase in TSA staff, and it is a good start. O'Hare will also receive 5 K-9 teams. That will double the number of K-9s we have at the airport. Two teams were brought in yesterday, and the rest will arrive within 5 days. These bomb-sniffing dogs do important work. They check carry-on baggage. If there is no problem, the passengers can move out of the standard line and into the expedited line. These dogs can help us speed up the process by allowing up to 5,000 additional passengers a day to move through the faster security lines. There will also be a shift of 100 TSA staff from part-time to full- time status so more people can be on deck to help with the lines. And officers who currently work on nondirect security functions are going to be called to pitch in and help officers at the checkpoints. We are also working to get more people enrolled in TSA PreCheck. I can't emphasize enough how important that is. For $85, a regular traveler can buy--or at least apply for and be given--a TSA PreCheck status for 5 years. PreCheck lines can scan nearly twice as fast as the ordinary lines. Customers don't have to wait as long or remove their shoes, belts, or light jackets. We need to make sure more people are hearing about this option and are signing up for it as quickly as possible. TSA is now working on a mobile app to help people get enrolled while they are waiting in lines, and they are also looking at lowering PreCheck signup costs by competing out the actual function of signing up for PreCheck. [[Page S3014]] PreCheck has gotten a lot of traction, especially in Chicago, where this past month alone we have seen 5,700 new enrollments. I hope we can continue to quickly expand this program to help more people into the faster lines. The airlines have to be part of the solution as well. I am glad Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut is on the floor because both he and Senator Markey of Massachusetts spoke out early on this aspect that I am about to address. Airlines can help us by reducing high wait times, especially during the peak summer season. I have joined my colleagues Senator Blumenthal and Senator Markey in urging the airlines to suspend the checked bag fees over the summer. A lot of people are dragging their bags on the airplanes because they don't want to pay to have them checked. On Monday, I spoke with Secretary Johnson, who told me baggage fees are contributing to long lines because more people are carrying on luggage that should be carefully screened through check-in. Over the last year, the volume of passengers and personnel passing through security checkpoints has increased 7 percent while the number of checked bags has increased only 3 percent. That tells the story: More people are carrying on their luggage and causing problems as more travelers pack their roller bags to the brim, making the bags take even longer to be scanned. Waiving the checked baggage fee during the summer travel season can reduce the incentive for passengers to carry-on luggage, and it can help speed up the process. Let me also add that it is in this baggage that people are dragging onboard that TSA screeners are finding things that aren't supposed to be on an airplane. Last year, they found 2,653 firearms, and 83 percent of them were loaded. Most of them were from one State; I will not name it. But by and large, we have to be more mindful of the fact that this stops the process or at least slows it down. I am convening a meeting with Administrator Neffenger tomorrow, along with State and local officials and airlines at Chicago O'Hare, and then we are also going to be visiting the Midway airport. We will see firsthand what airlines are experiencing and what their response is. We have to stop this meltdown when it comes to airport security. Let me close by saying this: The news today about EgyptAir was a grim reminder that we still live in a very dangerous world. The role and responsibility of the Transportation Security Agency is to make sure that when we and our families travel, we come off those planes just as safely as we went on. It is an important security responsibility. Yes, it is an irritation and a frustration, but we need to do it in this dangerous world to make sure that we stop people from using their carry-on baggage and other sources to cause harm to innocent people. I stand behind TSA and its mission, but what happened in Chicago is unacceptable. This meltdown should have been avoided. There should have been better management, more screeners, and we should have been ready for the surge in passengers. Beginning this week, we are going to make that right. I hope the visit by the TSA Administrator tomorrow will be the beginning of a conversation that will not only help our airports in Chicago but also help our Nation. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from Illinois for his leadership on this issue and his support for the initiative that Senator Markey and I first raised, which he has supported so very helpfully, and essentially that is to persuade the airlines to stop charging for bags that are checked onto planes as opposed to being carried on. Obviously, the fee for checking those bags adds to the number of carry-ons and provides an incentive for larger numbers of carry-ons. In fact, TSA itself reports that there has been an increase in carry-ons due to these fees. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank the Presiding Officer. The elimination of the fees for checked bags is not a panacea. It is not going to solve this problem alone. But it will, along with other measures, help reduce lines that result from screening. I commend Admiral Neffenger for his very close and prompt attention to this matter and for a number of the initiatives he has taken. We heard about them in the Commerce Committee this morning. I also thank Secretary Johnson for supporting elimination of the fees for checked bags. I think his leadership will be important. There are a number of other initiatives that can and should be taken. There is automated equipment that can expedite the screening of those carry-on bags. The use of additional screeners is important. The number has been reduced over the last 3 years by about 5,800. The addition of another close to 800 will help compensate. But again, alone, none of these solutions will provide the answer. As far as the automated equipment is concerned, the cost for the 20 busiest airports is about $30 million--a pittance compared to the $3.8 billion in revenue the airlines make every year as a result of the fees for checked baggage. I will repeat that: $3.8 billion is going to airlines as a result of their purposefully charging for bags checked instead of carried on. Many of those bags that go through screening now wind up in the holds of those airplanes anyway because there isn't room for them on the plane, so they wind up being checked at the gate. That simply adds to the cost and inconvenience of passengers: delayed flights, missed flights, flights that are in effect late because of the boarding problems. All of these accumulating issues are reasons to eliminate these fees and also give passengers the benefit of lower costs. My hope is that the airlines will voluntarily eliminate these fees for checked bags. After the meeting we had today with Admiral Neffenger, I am encouraged that the TSA will take initiative and help to implement other measures as well. In the meantime, we need the airlines to show some leadership as well, and I am hopeful they will do the right thing. The U.S. Travel Association has called it a national crisis. The evidence is irrefutable. At checkpoints that have no fee charges for bags, the carry-ons are 27 percent lower, so the numbers of carry-ons definitely diminish as the fees are eliminated. This evidence is irrefutable and argues powerfully that the airlines should not keep their passengers waiting in line. They should make some sacrifice to their bottom line and should not be profiting at the expense of their passengers. I will conclude by saying on this point--and I am so glad to see my colleague and friend from Massachusetts--that we need this initiative now, and we need it to happen. I also want to advocate on behalf of the safety of our roads. Blumenthal amendment No. 4002 will not be called up in part because it had been willfully mischaracterized by an industry campaign. In effect, we need to make truck drivers more safely empowered on the roads to take steps to protect themselves. Drivers who spend too much time behind the wheel are tired. They can't drive as safely. This amendment would enable them to drive more safely, give them the rest they need, protect them, and enable the roads to be safer not only for them but for people generally. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I yield to Senator Markey. Mr. MARKEY. I just want to thank the Senator for his work. We have been partnering on this issue of eliminating bag fees at airports. Since they have been imposed, 27 percent more bags now go through baggage clearing with passengers. If we could just get that out of the way, get rid of those baggage fees, I think it would expedite dramatically the ability of people to get on planes in this country. So I am glad we are able to have this moment to be able to speak about the importance of this issue. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, the Senator from Massachusetts and I have been partners in this effort, and I hope we can prevail. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. [[Page S3015]] Amendment No. 3970 to Amendment No. 3896 Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I call up the Collins-Reed-Cochran amendment No. 3970. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment numbered 3970 to amendment No. 3896. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to carry out a final rule and notice of the Department of Housing and Urban Development) At the appropriate place in division A, insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to direct a grantee to undertake specific changes to existing zoning laws as part of carrying out the final rule entitled ``Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing'' (80 Fed. Reg. 42272 (July 16, 2015)) or the notice entitled ``Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Assessment Tool'' (79 Fed. Reg. 57949 (September 26, 2014)). Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the amendment that Senator Jack Reed, Senator Thad Cochran, and I are offering would make very clear that none of the funds made available in this appropriations bill can be used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to direct a recipient of Federal funds to undertake changes to their zoning laws. There has been concern that some have brought up that a new rule that was issued last year by the Department would somehow allow HUD to be the national zoning authority for every neighborhood in our country. While I do not believe that is a correct interpretation of the fair housing amendment or regulation that HUD has promulgated, the Collins- Reed-Cochran amendment ensures that HUD cannot do that. It eliminates that possibility and ensures that communities will continue to make their own decisions to address these Federal requirements. By contrast, the proposal offered by my colleague from Utah, Senator Lee, would prohibit all funding for a rule that was issued by HUD based on a requirement that is included in the landmark civil rights era law known as the Fair Housing Act of 1968. It is important to know that this regulation was in direct response to a 2010 GAO report that criticized HUD's implementation of the requirement of the law that grantees, recipients of these funds, affirmatively enhance fair housing opportunities. It also was issued in response to requests from communities seeking guidance to ensure compliance because they don't want to be sued for inadvertently violating Fair Housing Act requirements. So communities asked HUD for more tools, better assessments, and more guidance to make sure that they were in compliance. It is important to know that the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination not only based on race, national origin, and religion but also against those with disabilities. Indeed, 56 percent of the complaints of housing discrimination have been initiated by individuals with disabilities. That is why Senator Lee's amendment is opposed by the Paralyzed Veterans of America and other disability groups, as well as the Urban League, the NAACP, and countless civil rights groups. On the first vote, we will be voting on the Collins-Reed-Cochran amendment. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Will Senator Collins yield briefly for a question? Ms. COLLINS. Yes, I will yield. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Senator Collins and every member of this body know that I support fair housing. It is so important for my State, where there is a lack of affordable housing, and the Anchorage School District is one of the most diverse in the Nation. However, I have heard concerns from people in Alaska. They worry not so much about the rule itself but about how HUD could implement it. Many communities in Alaska are overwhelmingly Alaska Native, 90 percent or more of the population. Will this affirmatively furthering fair housing rule result in Federal grants being withheld from communities that are currently and have long been populated almost entirely by Alaska Natives because those communities are now considered to be segregated? Ms. COLLINS. No community in the United States or its insular areas will lose Federal housing funds solely because of its racial demographics. There are communities throughout the United States that are racially homogenous for reasons that have nothing to do with discrimination or other historic barriers. The rule does not change the Fair Housing Act, which for decades has included the affirmative fair housing requirement. The whole purpose of the rule is to ensure that States and communities that receive Federal funds take this requirement seriously. This rule is a planning tool, created to help grantees identify barriers to fair housing and plan how to address them. The rule does not penalize any community for where it starts but rather assists a community in taking meaningful steps to address any barriers it may find. HUD would never deny Federal funds to a community simply because of its demographics. It has never done so in the 48 years since the passage of the Fair Housing Act, and it will not under this rule. Additionally, I know some have expressed concern about what effect this rule would have on Alaskan Natives and other Native Americans. HUD's housing programs for Native Alaskans and other Native Americana are authorized under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act, NAHASDA. NAHASDA includes a statutory exemption from the Fair Housing Act, which the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule does not change. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule, which my amendment would defund, is equal parts condescension and willful blindness. The condescension of this particular rule and its proponents is that local governments and public housing authorities across America can't figure out how to provide fair and affordable housing to their communities without the help, without the paternalistic interference of Federal bureaucrats. This is the epitome of the paternalism that informs so much of what happens in Washington, DC, today. I don't doubt, as Senator Collins has said repeatedly, that local governments would like ``better guidance'' from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington. But this is a problem that was created by HUD, with its onerous requirements and its vague mandates, not the result of local governments being unable or unwilling to provide adequate low-cost housing for their neighbors in need. This brings us to the willful blindness part of the affirmative furthering fair housing rule. Proponents of the rule claim that HUD officials consulted closely with local governments and public housing authorities when drafting and finalizing the AFFH rule. In their telling, local housing agencies across the country are welcoming the AFFH rule with open arms. But this ignores what local officials have actually said about AFFH. I will let these local officials speak for themselves. Roger Partridge, the county commissioner of Douglas County, CO, had this to say, in an email, about AFFH, the closed process that produced it, and the immense burdens it will place on local governments: Douglas County believes that the Assessment of Fair Housing tool as it now stands is an unfunded mandate that will create an administrative nightmare for jurisdictions who want to further fair housing and implement community programs with HUD grants. Partridge continues: HUD headquarters has repeatedly ignored the local practitioners responsible for AFFH and implementing the AFH in our communities. He continues: In fact, HUD headquarters staff was in Denver for a Public AFFH roundtable on April 21st, during [the AFH tool] comment period. They ignored the opportunity to inform Region VIII Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) staff or the local practitioners attending the roundtable. No notice from the HUD EXCHANGE to the grantee list serve was found. The local governments who were asked to comment on the publication were shut out of the process. Likewise, this is what we have heard from Salt Lake County officials: The administrative burden imposed by this tool is excessive. Resources that could be put [[Page S3016]] into housing related tasks are being funneled into completing the tool and its associated administrative tasks. Additionally, although HUD claims that this tool can be completed without the use of a consultant, the assessment is complex enough to warrant considering a consultant. The rule imposes a jurisdictional and regional analysis that is too complex to be effectively completed by staff without specific statistical and mapping knowledge. As housing providers, most staff at PHAs have comparative advantages that lie in providing affordable housing services, but not providing complex statistical data analysis. Forcing PHA staff to do this analysis is an inefficient use of their scarce time. Salt Lake County officials added the following: The AFH does not recognize the zero-sum nature of a PHA's resource allocation. By allocating resources to complete this process, PHAs are not allocating resources somewhere else. Those resources could be used to provide additional housing assistance. Instead of ignoring the words and the experiences of our local officials, and instead of condescending to them, we should listen to them and learn from them. We should stop this disastrous new housing rule from causing more problems than it has already caused. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Alabama is going to speak, and the Senator from Rhode Island should have an opportunity to speak. So I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute for each side prior to the votes in this series. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Lee's amendment that would prevent the implementation of HUD's affirmatively furthering fair housing regulation. Contrary to statements that have been made, the Senator's amendment does nothing to change fair housing laws or to prevent the enforcement thereof. What the Lee amendment does is to prevent the implementation of a rule that would give HUD Federal control over local planning decisions. Supporters of this program have argued that it is intended to protect communities from fair housing lawsuits. It is quite the contrary. This rule, if allowed to be implemented, will actually lay the predicate for endless litigation against every community in our respective States that are required to participate. This should be unacceptable to every Member of this body. Supporting Senator Lee's amendment is the only option before us to prevent centralized Federal control of local planning decisions. In my judgment, the Collins-Reed amendment does nothing to restrain the full implementation of HUD's program. I urge my colleagues to support the Lee amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. REED. Mr. President, the pending amendment is authored by my colleague from Maine and myself. The amendment makes very clear that local officials will remain in charge of zoning decisions and will determine how to best meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act. Those obligations are fundamental to our American fabric, our lives, and the aspirations of this country, because they protect Americans' housing choices no matter their physical ability, race, family status, or religion. These protections are fundamental to who we are. But without effective information and transparency so that local communities can make wise decisions, these aspirations can never be realized, are seldom realized, or are not realized to the extent that we, as Americans, feel that they should be. Senator Collins and I have worked very hard to develop language that provides local communities with wide flexibility to meet their requirements under the Fair Housing Act. Those requirements will still be there regardless of our action today. If the resources made available under the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing regulations are not provided, however, those communities will still be required to ensure that housing is available within their communities, regardless of race, physical ability, or the other protected classes under the law. The Lee amendment would make grantees liable for compliance without providing the data and tools needed to comply. The thrust--the heart and soul--of this HUD proposal, based on GAO analysis, is to give local communities the tools, so that they can determine the local answer that makes sense. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 4 minutes equally divided on the Collins amendment. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Let me just reiterate what I have been saying repeatedly. What the amendment Senator Reed, Senator Cochran, and I have introduced does is make very clear that HUD is prohibited from intervening in local decisions regarding zoning ordinances. That is in direct response to what some people have been claiming, incorrectly in my view; that the rule on affirmatively furthering fair housing would somehow allow HUD to be a national zoning commissar. That is not the case, but to make absolutely sure that could never happen, we have teamed up on this amendment to prohibit HUD from intervening in local zoning matters. It is very different from the Lee amendment, which we will discuss shortly. This is an important clarification that should take away any fear that there is any possibility of HUD using funds authorized by this bill to interfere in local zoning decisions. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Maine in and of itself is unobjectionable and does no harm, and on that basis I intend to vote for it. Unfortunately, it also doesn't do anything. It does nothing to help the many housing agencies that have told the Federal Government that President Obama's AFFH rule imposes far too many reporting costs and their already stretched staffs are going to suffer as a result. It does nothing to shield local housing authorities from the very many real lawsuits they will face as a result of the data collected from this regulation, and it does nothing to stop HUD from blackmailing local housing agencies with Community Development Block Grant Program funds. At this time, I wish to cede the remainder of my time to my friend, the senior Senator from Alabama. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we should all be aware that the Collins- Reed amendment provides no protections to local communities on their local planning rules because it merely prohibits an activity that the rule does not contemplate. Even the sponsor of this amendment acknowledged earlier today that the amendment prohibited an activity that she believed would not occur. Make no mistake that the so-called affirmatively furthering fair housing rule will likely heavily influence local zoning decisions. However, it does so indirectly, not through direct action as in the Collins-Reed amendment. HUD advertises this fact on its own Web site, where it details how communities will have to submit for approval an assessment of fair housing and that these communities will ``use the fair housing goals and priorities established in their [assessment] to inform the investments and other decisions made in their local planning processes.'' In other words, HUD does not intend to direct any specific zoning requirements. It does, however, intend to significantly influence local zoning decisions by withholding approval of local plans until they meet HUD's central planning goals. This amendment is not sufficient on its own. I believe the only way to prevent HUD from intruding into local community planning exactly as they openly state they intend to do is to support the Lee amendment. I believe the Collins-Reed amendment is not alternative to Senator Lee's amendment, it is, at best, complementary to the Lee amendment, and that is something we will have to vote on in just a few minutes. I thank the Presiding Officer. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of time on our side, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? [[Page S3017]] There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN: I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Heinrich), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 87, nays 9, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 80 Leg.] YEAS--87 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Blunt Boozman Burr Cantwell Capito Carper Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Lee Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Mikulski Moran Murkowski Murray Nelson Paul Perdue Peters Portman Reed Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Schumer Scott Sessions Shaheen Shelby Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Warner Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--9 Booker Brown Cardin Menendez Merkley Murphy Reid Schatz Warren NOT VOTING--4 Boxer Cruz Heinrich Sanders The amendment (No. 3970) was agreed to. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Ms. COLLINS. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 3897 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). There is now 4 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the Lee amendment No. 3897. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the subsequent votes in this series be 10 minutes in length. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, unlike the Collins amendment that just passed with broad support, my amendment would actually do something with respect to affirmatively furthering the fair housing rule. Specifically, it would defund this rule and ultimately force the Department of Housing and Urban Development to respond to the GAO in a way that does not undermine local control or increase costs on already stretched thin local housing agencies. My colleagues who oppose this amendment have given a number of examples of local governments being newly connected to make better governing decisions, but my amendment in no way stops local governments from continuing to do that. All my amendment does--the only thing it does--is to prevent the Federal Government from forcing local governments to comply with a costly and unnecessary new data collection program, and it does so in order to protect local autonomy. I therefore encourage each of my colleagues to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my colleague Senator Lee would prohibit all funding for a fair housing regulation issued by HUD based on a requirement of a landmark civil rights law, the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Not only was this not a regulation that appeared out of thin air, the GAO did a report criticizing HUD, and once the regulation was implemented, closed the recommendation. In addition, communities asked HUD to issue better guidance on this part of the law so that they could avoid being sued under the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I move to table the Lee amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Amendments Nos. 4050 and 4026, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3896 Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number: Amendment No. 4050, offered by Senator Rubio; and amendment No. 4026, as modified, offered by Senator Baldwin. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the amendments en bloc by number. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for others, proposes amendments numbered 4050 and 4026, as modified, en bloc to amendment No. 3896.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before I make some closing remarks, I would yield to Senator Reed, who has been such an extraordinary partner as we have worked together in a transparent and collaborative way to bring this bill across the finish line. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me return the compliment to the Chairman of the committee, Senator Collins of Maine, for her extraordinary insight, leadership, and ability to bring us together. This bill reflects the priorities of members on both sides of the aisle, it reflects sound policy, and it was a pleasure to work with her. I think that she will also commend our extraordinary staffs who provided support, working many times when we were not working to get the job done. I thank Dabney Hegg, Heideh Shahmoradi, Christina Monroe, Nathan Robinson, Jordan Stone, Jason Woolwine, Mike Clarke, Lydia Collins, and Gus Maples. These are professionals who are thoughtful, skillful, pleasant, and probably deserving of the real praise for work done on the floor. Let me once again thank Senator Collins for her thoughtful leadership and her commitment to fairness and principle. I think that she is one of the major reasons we are here today. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senate has completed its consideration of this appropriations measure, which provides essential funding for the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, related agencies, military construction programs, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and to combat Zika. I thank all of my colleagues for working together with us in an open and collaborative manner. I would note that the legislation we just passed incorporates some 40 [[Page S3019]] amendments. There were also recommendations from more than 75 Senators from both sides of the aisle included in the Transportation-HUD appropriations portion of this bill which were incorporated at the committee level. I thank all of my colleagues for giving us their suggestions, their requests, and their insights. It made for a better bill. As I mentioned, I am particularly grateful to Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Transportation-HUD Subcommittee, for his work. I also thank the staff for their diligence and commitment throughout this process. As Senator Reed mentioned, we worked extremely hard, but our staff worked even harder. So I thank Heideh Shahmoradi, Rajat Mathur, Jason Woolwine, Lydia Collins, Gus Maples, Dabney Hegg, Nathan Robinson, Christina Monroe, Jordan Stone, and Mike Clarke on the subcommittee staff. I also give special thanks to the floor and cloakroom staffs who worked so hard. Without the help of Laura Dove and her team and the team on the Democratic side, we could not be where we are today. They did a lot of the vetting that needed to be done on various amendments. They helped us in the negotiations and compromises that ultimately were included in this bill. I would note that our Transportation-HUD portion of this bill recognizes the fiscal reality while making critical investments into our crumbling infrastructure and economic development projects. It meets our responsibility to vulnerable populations. I think most of our colleagues are unaware that 84 percent of HUD's budget goes to subsidized housing. When we fund that, we keep very vulnerable low- income families, disabled individuals, and our low-income seniors from being at risk of homelessness. We also paid special attention in this bill to vulnerable homeless populations, such as our veterans and our young people. We continued a program the administration wanted to abolish that helps our homeless veterans, to whom we owe so much--$57 million in new vouchers, so that we can continue the progress we are making in housing our homeless veterans. Since we started this program, the number of homeless veterans has declined by about one-third. This program works, but we can't declare victory until the job is done. That is why both last year and this year we funded the program, even though the President's budget sought to eliminate it. We have made real investments in helping some of our most vulnerable young people, and those are youth who have been in the Foster Care Program and then age out of that program. In some cases, they are aging out of the program before they have even graduated from high school, and they have nowhere to go. So through family reunification vouchers and other programs, we are beefing up support so they don't fall through the cracks and become vulnerable to traffickers, to dropping out of school, to couch surfing, or ending up in shelters. In particular, I am very proud of the work we have done in that area. I am very pleased this bill funds the TIGER Grant Program at $525 million. This program has been extraordinarily popular and effective. It has funded projects in each and every State--projects that have led to job creation and economic development. When we think about it, at heart, much in this bill is about creating jobs and security for our fellow citizens. If you don't have a place to live, it is very difficult to show up for work every day. If the infrastructure is crumbling, it is very difficult for a business to hire the employees who produce the products and get those products to market. The construction projects this bill will fund creates good-paying jobs. In many ways, I think of this as a jobs bill. Let me give another example of a very popular program, the Community Development Block Grant Program. If you ask of the mayors and other town and city officials in your State, they will point to that program as one that gives them the flexibility to improve their downtowns, to make investments that bring new employers to the region, to build affordable housing, whatever their needs are, and that is the beauty of that program. It is not dictated from Washington. It gives tremendous flexibility to States and communities to design the kinds of economic development programs that boost growth and create jobs. In short, our bill strikes the right balance between thoughtful investment and fiscal restraint and thereby sets the stage for future economic growth, something I know the Presiding Officer has been a real leader in speaking out about and reminding us that must be our focus as Members of the Senate. I am also pleased we were able to bring spending bills to the floor for Members to examine, debate, and vote on in a transparent manner. The worst situation is when we do a series of continuing resolutions temporarily funding the essential functions of government. They create such uncertainty, they lock in priorities from previous years rather than reflecting today's priorities, and they end up costing more money. Agencies are unable to enter into contracts. Businesses, because of the uncertainty, tend to build in a little extra into their bids. It is a terrible way to operate. Equally bad is the practice of bundling all 12 of the appropriations bills into one gigantic omnibus bill, thousands of pages long, that is rushed through at the end of the fiscal year--or, more often, at the expiration of one of those continuing resolutions that I just deplore. We are not doing that this year. This is the third appropriations bill that the Senate has passed earlier than ever, with great cooperation from both sides of the aisle. The Members of the Appropriations Committee and its two leaders, Senator Cochran and Senator Mikulski, deserve great credit for putting us on a strict schedule and keeping the process moving. In fact, in the full committee today, we approved two more appropriations bills that are ready to come to the Senate floor. That is the way the process used to work. That is the way the process should work, and that is the way the process is working this year. I believe it is a great credit to the Senate, to the leaders of the Appropriations Committee, and to Majority Leader McConnell, who has made it a goal that all 12 bills be reported by the Appropriations Committee and brought to the Senate floor, individually or two or three combined, for full and open debate. Again, I thank Members on both sides of the aisle. Many of your requests are included in this important legislation. I feel fortunate to have worked with Senator Jack Reed on this bill. He is not only a great colleague and a terrific Senator but also a good friend. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3004-S3019] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate seeing the Presiding Officer in the chair and having a ``Corey'' represented and presiding over the U.S. Senate. I rise today to speak against an amendment now pending to this bill that would block a rule that seeks to fulfill the promise of the Fair Housing Act. This issue is very deeply personal to me and one that really has defined my own personal history. I would like to start by telling a story. In 1969, just 1 year after the passage of the Fair Housing Act, a couple here in Washington, DC, married with two boys, decided to move to New Jersey. In New Jersey, they encountered a lot of a practice called real estate steering, where Black couples were steered away from certain neighborhoods. Realizing they were being steered away from White neighborhoods, they grew frustrated, and they sought the help of the fair housing council. They set up an elaborate sting operation where my parents would go look at a home--or this couple would go look at a home--and they would then be followed by a White couple. The couple was told the house was sold or it was not for sale. The White couple would then appear and find out if that was, indeed, true. Most often for this couple from Washington, DC, yes, they would find out the house was still for sale. Eventually this couple found a house they loved in a small town called Harrington Park, NJ, but they were told that the house was not for sale. They were told the house had been pulled off the market or sold. They left. Then the White couple came behind them. Lo and behold, the house had not been sold or was not pulled off the market. The White couple pretended that they loved the house as the Black couple did and put a bid on the house. The bid was accepted. On the day of the closing, instead of the White couple showing up, the African-American gentleman from the Black couple and a volunteer lawyer came to confront the real estate agent. The real estate agent was so upset that he stood up and punched the lawyer representing the Black couple and sicced his dog on the African-American man. Yet the law was on their side. The fair housing law of the United States of America, the law of the Federal Government, was on their side. Eventually, that Black couple and their two kids moved into that home in Harrington Park, NJ. That was 1969. It was the year I was born, and that couple was my parents, Cary and Carolyn Booker. That is my origin story. Legislation that this body passed empowered my family to move into the home of their dreams in an all-White neighborhood with incredibly good schools that I went through from K-12. I am the beneficiary of work this body did to ensure that our American values are preserved, our values of inclusion and integration, to make sure fair housing is the law of the land. That work gave me my start in life. The activism of local activists, combined with the law of the land as passed by us, defined my path. After decades of struggle in communities across the country, we have largely been successful in banning overt housing discrimination. We [[Page S3005]] should be proud of our work. But legislation that we passed should not become a relic of history. It is not something for us to turn and admire. We all know on many issues the cause of freedom and the cause of justice necessitate constant vigilance. So I rise today with the knowledge that while major pieces of civil rights legislation like the Fair Housing Act have had a significant impact on millions of Americans--White, Black, Latino, Asian, disabled--this has had a full impact. We still have work to do to continue that vigilance to make sure that those values, those ideals, and the law of the land are made real for families. Unfortunately, for nearly 50 years there has not been real guidance, direction, or tools to help local officials achieve the goals of the Fair Housing Act, which are integrated housing, fair housing, equal access. In 2010, in fact, the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, failed to properly administer oversight obligations under the Fair Housing Act and failed to monitor its guarantees for compliance with the law. In 2013, HUD proposed affirmatively furthering fair housing, a new rule that would seek to fulfill the promise of the Fair Housing Act and eliminate a lot of the historic patterns of segregation that still go on in America today. The vision for the rule is to institute a data- driven analysis of localities and to develop Federal grant programs for housing and economic inclusion. When I was mayor, people came to me with passions and accusations and the like. I used to always say: In God we trust, but, everybody else, bring me data. It is important to look at the numbers to know what really is going on. So HUD brought about this idea of making sure we have that data--not in a rushed process. The administration engaged in a diligent 2-year rulemaking process with public inclusion, participation from others, and lots of public comment periods. They finalized that rule in July 2015. It is unfortunate that one of my dear colleagues--somebody whom I value very much because we do a lot of work across the aisle--has introduced an amendment that would block this rule's implementation, and I must respectfully disagree with the intent of this amendment. The Fair Housing Act and, really, the entirety of the Civil Rights Act were meant, again, to be real today, not just relics of yesterday. They were meant to be guideposts and standards by which we hold ourselves accountable for the values we put forth. The affirmatively further fair housing rule is a measure of accountability for HUD and for ourselves. You cannot change what you cannot measure. Let me say that again. I learned this as a manager: If you can't measure it, you can't change it or affect it. The rule will arm communities most in need with knowledge and numbers so they can make intelligent local decisions and best apply their resources. It is what everyone who has to manage something needs: accurate data. It will improve the access to quality data on local demographics and streamline the process for analyzing local fair housing impediments, helping grantees establish their own local fair housing priorities. This rule does not interfere with local zoning or housing laws, and it prevents further taxpayer dollars from being used to discriminate. Every stakeholder--every one of us--is afforded an opportunity to comment on the rule that HUD made, and, as a former local leader, it empowers people at the localities to do justice by their communities. This is a balanced and a measured rule, and it takes up the cause of the work to make our country more and more just. I know personally that so much of the character of our country comes from the values we have as a whole. There are rare times in our history where this body is called upon to affirm those values. This body's history--the noble history of this body--is something I have benefited from personally around fair housing. Now we have more tools necessary, with big data and analysis, to more effectively and affirmatively assert our values and ensure injustice is not being done. I want to make sure that we defeat this amendment for those reasons. I believe and know the values of my colleague who proposed this. I do not think it achieves the end that we want to see by disempowering people to try to help families like mine. I was a child in DC moving to New Jersey and found justice--found a pathway toward integration. Indeed, I doubt I would be here right now if it weren't for the laws of our land. I hope we can defeat this amendment and ensure that our Nation becomes more fair and more just and that more families like mine can find the America we hail when we pledge allegiance to the flag and say we are a Nation of liberty and justice for all. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum calls be charged equally, fairly--like fair housing--fairly, to both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized. The Appropriations Process Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senators have been working diligently this week, continuing our efforts to advance American priorities and responsibly fund important programs through the appropriations process. We have made good progress so far. The Senate already passed one funding bill by a broad majority at a record early time. Another Appropriations subcommittee approved its own funding bill just the other day, and it is my hope that we will be able to move two more funding measures across the finish line very shortly. With continued work and cooperation, we can do just that. The two measures before us are the result of hard work, negotiation, and compromise. They are the product of strong leadership by Senators Collins and Kirk, and they are the culmination of a good deal of input from both sides of the aisle. Here is what we know these bills can achieve: The transportation and housing infrastructure appropriations bill will invest in our transportation systems and help ensure safety and efficiency. The veterans and military construction funding bill will help improve care for veterans and increase oversight and accountability efforts at the VA. The legislation before us will also include a provision to help address Zika. This compromise provision will focus on immediate needs while also providing resources for longer term goals such as a vaccine. It is another reminder that keeping Americans safe and healthy is a top priority for us all. Let's continue our work today to move these important funding measures closer to passage. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3897 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, a home is more than just a roof over someone's head; it is actually where a family builds their lives. In our country, we need to do everything we can to make sure families have options when it comes to finding a place to live, and they need access to affordable, safe, and fair housing. Unfortunately, today Republicans want to deal a significant blow to fair housing. The amendment they are offering would tear down the civil rights protections in the Fair Housing Act of 1968, and I am here today to strongly urge my colleagues to vote against it. Before the civil rights movement, African Americans faced an enormous amount of injustice and racism in housing. People of color were often relegated to substandard housing. They were denied mortgages, and rent in an [[Page S3006]] African-American neighborhood was often higher than rent in a White neighborhood. When the Fair Housing Act went into effect in 1968, it not only banned discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing, it went a step further: A new Federal housing agency was charged with proactively rooting out discrimination and segregation in communities across the country. That is an important part of the law because today people across the country still face systemic and sometimes racially motivated barriers to housing. People with disabilities, people of color, families with children, and religious groups in many areas have limited housing choices. Last year the Department of Housing and Urban Development, also known as HUD, issued a long-overdue rule to help carry out that mission to proactively eliminate housing segregation and discrimination. For States and local governments that get HUD investments, this rule would improve the quality and access to data on demographics, it would help researchers analyze the barriers people face to access fair housing, and it would help set priorities and goals for carrying out the mission to actively fight back against discrimination and segregation. Based on pilot programs from around the country, we know this rule can help expand opportunity to more Americans. One of those pilots was in Seattle in my home State of Washington. After an assessment of high- poverty areas in Puget Sound, the city saw that neighborhoods that historically have been disenfranchised lacked job opportunities. Armed with that data, the city is setting up a food distribution center and a job incubator in those neighborhoods. The city's work is helping to foster job growth in places where low-income residents live, and through that work, the city expanded economic security to more people. That would not have been possible without the data this long-overdue rule provided us. This is the kind of success this new rule will help further, but unfortunately we are seeing that some Republicans want to put a stop to those positive changes and backtrack on the gains we have made on civil rights in housing, and to me, that is unacceptable. Here in Congress, we should be clearing pathways for more Americans to access more housing, not blocking the away. I am here today to urge my colleagues to vote against that amendment, which we will be voting on later. Mr. President, while I have the floor, I wish to talk about another topic that is very important to me. I am very honored to come to the floor today with good news for thousands of military families, including three couples I met just last week here in the Nation's Capital. Each of the veterans I met with had suffered a catastrophic injury while fighting for our country, which changed the course of their lives and their families' lives forever. Matt Keil was shot by a sniper and paralyzed. Kevin Jaye was injured by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Tyler Black was paralyzed during a firefight. What was the one thing each of these veterans wished for after he returned home and got out of the hospital? Well, like so many women and men in our country, they dreamed of having a family of their own. Even though each veteran suffered injuries that made it nearly impossible to conceive naturally, they have hope because in this day and age, the medical technology exists to make their dream of having a family come true. The most popular path is in vitro fertilization, known as IVF, but because of a policy enacted decades ago, the VA is barred from covering the costs of IVF, which forced Matt, Kevin, and Tyler, with their partners, to go down that road alone even though their injuries were caused while serving all of us overseas. Collectively, they have paid tens and tens of thousands of dollars out- of-pocket. Matt said to me that when he heard the VA wouldn't cover the one medical procedure he and his wife wanted so badly, he felt like his country had abandoned him. We are talking about a man who sacrificed his body for our country. I believe this is wrong. When this country sends brave men and women to work, we promise to take care of them when they return home. That is why I have been fighting to change this policy once and for all, and today I am very proud to see this effort take a big step forward with bipartisan support here in the Senate. My provision in the underlying VA appropriations bill will finally allow the VA to cover those costs and let our veterans know their country is there for them when they come home. It is the right thing to do for Matt and his wife Tracy, Kevin and Lauren, Tyler and Crystal, and every other military family in this country. As we move to pass this bill through the Senate, I call on my colleagues in the House to follow suit and get this done. This is not about politics or partisanship, and we shouldn't be cutting corners when it comes to our veterans and their families. This is a chance to support our veterans and the dreams they have fought so hard for--to have a family. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3900, as Modified Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I call for regular order with respect to the Blunt amendment No. 3900. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending. Mr. LEE. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise not to debate the broad question of the Federal Government's proper role in protecting and advancing public health; instead, I am here to stress to my colleagues that with a growing national debt that will soon exceed $20 trillion, we cannot continue spending money we don't have. If this emergency supplemental measure is adopted, it will be the 15th emergency supplemental we have passed since 2006, totaling about $190 billion in deficit spending. This is not how responsible governments budget. It is not how responsible governments behave. Indeed, we have the ability to provide the resources the country needs to fight the Zika virus without adding to our national debt. For starters, we can undo the $500 million President Obama took from the international infectious diseases account which was placed in his unapproved Green Climate Fund. USAID is sitting on $1.2 billion in unobligated Ebola funds. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response currently has $347 million not being put to use. There is $525 million in CDC's global health security agenda that is unspoken for. To the extent that the Zika virus is truly an emergency, one that deserves the Federal Government's attention, we already have more than enough unused emergency funds to pay for the fight against this emerging threat. Yesterday, my colleague, the distinguished junior senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Lankford, illustrated that this administration has tens of billions of dollars in unobligated discretionary funds to pay for this as well. What we should not do, however, is allow the Zika virus to be yet another excuse to run up the national debt, just so appropriators can come back and use unspent emergency money on nonemergency parochial priorities at some later date. The entire emergency spending label is to some, perhaps, a little bit misleading. It does not mean that the money gets spent any faster. All it does is give Congress the ability to spend the money without having to pay for it, to spend the money without having to offset it somewhere else. That is not how we should operate. I urge my colleagues to uphold this budget point of order. Mr. President, pursuant to section 314(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I raise a point of order against all of the emergency designations contained in amendment No. 3900, a list of which I am sending to the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I certainly share the deep concern expressed by my colleague from Utah over the growing size of the Federal debt. It is a serious problem. I encourage him to look at the chart that Senator Alexander has produced, which shows where the problem is. [[Page S3007]] The problem is on the mandatory side of the budget, not the discretionary side of the budget, which, due to efforts we have made, has been held relatively flat for several years. But the mandatory spending side of the budget is soaring. There is no doubt about that. For example, many of us, when the administration presented its budget, rejected the gimmicks that were included, for example, in the transportation budget to shift some $7 billion from discretionary to mandatory spending. That was unwarranted. We did not do that. But if ever there were an emergency, it is the threat posed to public health by the Zika virus. About 2 weeks ago, Senator Johnny Isakson and I went to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA, and heard briefings from the top experts in the world about the threat posed by the Zika virus. The fact is that the news keeps getting worse and worse. Zika has now been linked for certain to a severe kind of birth defect, making pregnant women particularly at risk. It has also been linked to a disease known as Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause paralysis and even death. Those of us who live in Northern States--this kind of mosquito, for example, is found only in the very southern tip of Maine--should take no comfort from that fact. The CDC has documented cases of the Zika virus in virtually every State in the Union, and that is because disease knows no boundaries in this world of international travel. In addition, the CDC has documented approximately 1,000 cases of Zika. It is an epidemic in Puerto Rico, where there are more than 475 documented cases--a true crisis for that U.S. territory. From my perspective, we have to act. We have to act quickly. The Blunt-Murray compromise bill deserves the emergency designation which is attached to it. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget regulations, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the Blunt-Murray amendment No. 3900, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I believe we are going to have that vote a little bit later. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Amendment No. 4039 Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, last night I was off the floor when Senator McCain of Arizona offered an amendment regarding the Veterans Choice bill. Before the decision is made, I wish to memorialize my support for the McCain amendment. As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, we waived jurisdiction so it could be offered on the VA component of this bill. I wish to add one further comment. The cost associated with extending the eligibility of Veterans Choice by 3 years, which is the McCain amendment, scores at a cost. But to recognize that cost, you have to assume we would not have treated an eligible veteran under any other program if Choice expired. We are never going to abandon our veterans. We have a commitment to the veterans for the health care they have signed up for. What Senator McCain is doing is trying to improve access to health care and to maintain access through the choice of a private sector provider or through a VA provider. There is no additional cost, unless you assume that you want to take away a benefit that we gave 2 years ago in the omnibus that we passed. I commend Senator McCain for extending the eligibility for Choice for 3 more years. I will support the amendment when it comes before the Senate, and I encourage all other Members to do the same. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote in relation to H.R. 2577. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3900, as Modified Under the previous order, all postcloture time has expired. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion to waive. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: The Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 70, nays 28, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 76 Leg.] YEAS--70 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Blunt Booker Boozman Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Cochran Collins Coons Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Hoeven Isakson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murkowski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Portman Reed Reid Roberts Rounds Rubio Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Tillis Udall Vitter Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--28 Barrasso Coats Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Heller Inhofe Johnson Lankford Lee Moran Paul Perdue Risch Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Thune Toomey NOT VOTING--2 Cruz Sanders The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 70, the nays are 28. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to and the point of order falls. Amendment No. 3946 The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3946, offered by the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on this amendment, I yield back the remainder of our time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time is yielded back. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 3946) was agreed to. Amendment No. 3900, as Modified, as Amended The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3900, offered by the majority leader for Mr. Blunt and Mrs. Murray. The Senator from Missouri. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, we have looked at the proposal. I think we have reached an agreement on the proposal that takes this issue up through September of next year. I think now is the time to move forward. I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment, and at that point we will work with the House for a final conclusion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that Republicans refused to work with us to fully fund the President's emergency supplemental proposal, and it shouldn't have taken us so long to get to this point, but I am pleased that this will move us to a down payment on the President's emergency funding package through the Senate. [[Page S3008]] I want to commend Chairman Blunt for his work with us on this and all the Democrats and Republicans who are supporting it. But I want to remind all of us, this is only a first step, and we have to make sure that this agreement gets through the House and to the President's desk in the least amount of time. I hope we can separate it from this bill and move it quickly. That was objected to yesterday over pay-fors, which are not part of this amendment, but this is a critical emergency. We need to move on this first step, and I hope we can do it in a timely manner. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. VITTER. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is necessarily absent.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the cloture vote on the Collins amendment No. 3896, Senator Enzi or his designee be recognized to make a budget point of order against McCain amendment No. 4039; further, that Senator McCain be recognized to make a motion to waive the point of order and that the Senate immediately vote on the motion to waive. I further ask that the votes in this series be 10 minutes in length, strictly enforced. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Amendments Nos. 3898 and 3899, as Modified, Withdrawn The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendments Nos. 3898 and 3899 are withdrawn. The Senator from Wyoming. Amendment No. 4039 Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his tremendous effort on behalf of veterans and the different approaches he has used. I don't think anybody has worked harder on it or understands it better. I wish there were more we could do for veterans and will work with him to see that that happens, but this amendment isn't the right place to do it. This amendment proposes that we increase overspending by $7.7 billion for a continuation of the Veterans Choice Program. It doesn't offer badly needed reforms to the program, it simply provides more funding. Unfortunately, the accountability measures currently in place at the VA do not go far enough in ensuring that the health care needs of our veterans are the priority. By extending the Choice Program, we would be extending problematic waiting periods, we would be extending a backlog of health care claims, and we would be giving little or no authority to the VA to manage its employees. We have been getting complaints about many of these things, and another veterans proposal in the Senate improves both health care access for veterans and expanded disciplinary [[Page S3009]] measures at the VA. Senator McCain has worked on that as well. At the same time, it provides offsets to ensure that we continue to help our veterans in the future. I have been concerned about what I thought was $6 billion of emergency expense every year. I had them actually total that up in the committee and found out that we do $26.1 billion a year in emergency spending. We are going to have to find that money somewhere because if we don't provide offsets, we will not be able to help our veterans or our military or our education or anything else. Continued spending without making responsible choices for priorities will put us in a real hole. In order to make sure we are spending on our priorities, such as national defense and our veterans, and that they are not crowded out, I raise a point of order. Mr. President, pursuant to section 314(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I raise a point of order against the emergency designation found on page 3, lines 7 through 12, of amendment No. 4039 to H.R. 2577, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note with some interest that the Senator from Wyoming did not have the same zeal for the $1.1 billion that we just passed in emergency spending for Zika that is not paid for, but the important issue is, that this is a program for 1.4 million appointments for veterans who would otherwise wait for delayed care, over 2.5 million separate payments to doctors, 450,000 Choice health care providers--the list goes on and on. All I am asking for is an extension of a program that is in effect and helping our veterans. The fact is, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee said last night: What Senator McCain is trying to do to improve access to health care is maintain the access through the choice of a private sector provider or VA provider. There is no additional cost unless you assume that you want to take away a benefit that was given 2 years ago in the omnibus bill we passed. He goes on to say he would support this amendment. Who is taking advantage? The majority of the people who are taking advantage of this Choice Card, I will tell the Senator from Wyoming, are the young men and women who are just returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. We are giving them a choice. We are giving them a choice to be able to get the care they need and deserve. In my home State of Arizona, 50 veterans died while on a nonexistent waiting list--50 of them. That is why we have a Choice Card, so they can go out and get the care they need and want and not be on a nonexistent waiting list. I don't know what the priorities are of the Senator from Wyoming, but I can tell him now, they are not mine, and they are not of the men and women who are serving this Nation who deserve the best care and the choice of going to the provider that they want to within certain parameters. This is simply an extension of a program that is in existence that cares for our men and women who served our Nation with sacrifice, and some of them didn't even come back to have a chance to have a Choice Card. Mr. President, I ask to waive the budget point of order. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable budget resolutions for the purposes of my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

On this vote, the yeas are 84, the nays are 14. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to, and the point of order falls. The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 1:45 p.m. be equally divided between the two managers or their designees and that at 1:45 p.m. the Senate vote in relation to the Collins amendment No. 3970 and the Lee amendment No. 3897; further, that following disposition of the Lee amendment, all postcloture time be expired; that the substitute amendment, as amended, be adopted; that the cloture motion on the underlying bill be withdrawn, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the issue that was just brought up dealing with veterans funding and specifically the Choice Program. Three years ago, Congress put into place a response to what was happening in VA centers all over the country. We were all appalled with what was happening at VA centers all over the country. But for any of us who are in congressional offices, we were aware, were pushing on this issue, and had pushed on this issue for a while. But the media exposed what we all saw, and that was long-secret waiting lists for veterans so that the VA centers could keep their positive numbers up and look better--months of waiting for things that would take days across the street. As I dealt with the VA center in my own city, at times it would take 6 months to get a knee replacement surgery at the VA center, when at the great hospital directly across the street, they could get that same surgery within 2 days. As to hearing aids, it would take months and months to actually go through the process and to get them at our VA centers. As to cancer care, if you were diagnosed with cancer and had needs and treatment that was going to be required, they would literally send you across the country, sometimes more than 2,000 miles away, to actually get cancer treatment--away from your family. Congress responded to that by putting into place the Choice Act. It was an emergency. There were major problems that were happening around the country in multiple VA centers, and there had to be a response right then. Congress set aside emergency funding and an emergency response to make sure something came into existence that only loosely existed before. What was called community care was now clarified to say that this is Choice, and it was simple. If a veteran had to wait [[Page S3010]] more than 30 days to get into an appointment or get treatment or if they lived more than 40 miles from a VA center, they would be given the option to go wherever they wanted to go. VA was required to start working relationships in every community across the country so that veterans would have the option to go wherever they wanted to go. I would acknowledge that program is in its infancy. It is 2 years old at this point. It has a ways to go to be perfected. There are still problems with it, and there is a constant push from Congress to provide accountability to make sure that program is done and done well. That should be the first step in giving veterans real choice. The first step of that is 30 days or 40 miles. The second step of that is any VA- eligible veteran would get a card and they could go to anyplace that accepts Medicare. If they accept Medicare anywhere in the country--any lab, any hospital, any doctor--they should also be able to receive veterans as well. So veterans can go wherever they choose to go regardless of the distance. I have veterans who drive past six great hospitals, drive 200 miles to get to a VA center, and their families have the burden of all of that travel. It should not be that way. Veterans should be able to go wherever they choose to go for care. So the Choice Program is not only a good program, it is the right direction to go and it is a positive first step. But here is the problem: The way this particular amendment has come up, it is not only not germane to this bill because it deals with something that started 3 years ago and we are dealing with a new bill right now, but it is also an issue of, we are doing the right thing the wrong way. My staff has heard me say this over and over again: There is a right thing to do and there is a right way to do it. Three years ago, we knew this was an issue. Three years ago, the planning should have been put in place to put this into the normal appropriations process. This process puts it into place, so we are adding $7.5 billion onto our children for a program that should be in the normal appropriations process that was started 3 years ago and that is not an emergency anymore. This is not an emergency. This is now normal funding of a program we want to keep going and expand. So there is a big issue here we do have to resolve. I want to see us do the Choice Program and do it right, but there is a right thing to do and a right way to do it. This program is already fully funded through the next year. It is not an emergency. It is in place, funded, and ready to go. It doesn't go away in the next year, all the way through the fiscal year. Let's put it in the normal process, let's do it the right way, and let's not add $7 billion to our children for an emergency that is actually a year away. No one is going to convince me that in a $4 trillion budget, there are not areas we could cut. Earlier this week I identified $86 billion in funds that are available to cover the $1 billion for Zika that this Congress decided to do in emergency funding anyway. We have the funds available. We can honor our veterans. We can do this and also honor our children. At the same time we are honoring our veterans, let's honor the next generation and make sure we are not adding debt to the next generation. With that, Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the McCain amendment No. 4039 is not germane to the Collins amendment No. 3896, as amended, or H.R. 2577. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained, and the amendment falls. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support my VA spending bill to final passage. It is a very bipartisan bill. I also would like to thank my ranking Democratic member, Senator Jon Tester of Montana, who has been a great partner. We have worked with all Senators on both sides of the aisle to include their priorities and have worked through dozens of amendments. We include more than two dozen amendments in this bill. The bill provides record funding for our veterans' health care, protects whistleblowers, includes opioid safety, and also has the RAID Act to clean up the VA so that cockroaches are not in the VA kitchens and dining facilities. This bill also adds 100 staff to the IG's office and combats veteran homelessness. It requires better screening of VA doctors so they can't switch from State to State. The bill also increases medical research and adds money for health care for our veterans. I thank the subcommittee staff for doing outstanding work this year, and that includes Tina Evans, Chad Schulken, Michael Bain, Robert Henke, D'Ann Lettieri, Patrick Magnuson, and Carlos Elias. The bottom line: This bill does right by our troops and does right by our veterans. I thank my Senate colleagues and urge its rapid adoption. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to voice my full support for the fiscal year 2017 Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies appropriations bill which includes the fiscal year 2017 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and related agencies appropriations bill. Each of these bills was passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee by a vote of 30-0 last month. I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan package of bills. I commend Senators Collins and Reed for their hard work on the T-HUD bill and their collegiality on the floor this week managing this bill. T-HUD is our annual jobs bill making investments at the State and local level, delivering on America's physical infrastructure needs and America's compelling human needs. The bill before us will keep our roads and transportation systems safe and in good repair while preserving housing assistance for our Nation's most in need. I am especially proud of Senators Collins and Reed for making renewed investments in lead paint poison prevention. As the Maryland Senator from Baltimore, this is an issue I know all too well. Senator Kit Bond and I worked together on the VA-HUD bill to first bring attention to this crippling public health problem. April 19 marked the anniversary of Freddie Gray's death, a young man who grew up in Baltimore's low- income housing. Before Freddie's second birthday, his blood lead levels were seven times the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's suggested level, leaving Freddie severely and permanently brain damaged. Today there are still half a million children under the age of 6 with lead poisoning. This bill increases lead prevention funding in three programs. First, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes is funded at $135 million, an increase of $25 million to support lead-based paint hazard reductions in 1,750 additional units. This program provides safer homes for more than 6,200 people. Second, the Mikulski-Bond Lead Hazard Reduction Demo Program is funded at $55 million, an increase of $10 million. This program provides competitive funds to State and local governments to implement lead hazardous reduction programs in privately owned and owner-occupied housing. Third, the Public Housing Capital Fund is funded at $1.9 billion, an increase of $25 million. This will remediate 1,500 public housing units. This bill also includes a number of reforms to HUD's lead programs. Among these is the requirement for HUD to update its blood level standard to the stronger Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standard. HUD's standard hasn't been updated since 1999. In addition, the bill makes studio and efficiency apartments eligible for remediation grants for the first time. It is estimated that 34,000 zero-bedroom dwellings house children under 6 years old. The transportation portion of this bill makes significant investments in Maryland's highways, byways, and transit systems. It cuts the first check under the FAST Act passed last December. This means more formula funding for every State. For Maryland, that is an increase of $62 million. For transit, this bill provides increased funding for the Federal Transit [[Page S3011]] Administration totaling $575 million. It includes the Job Corridor- Purple Line project in the Washington suburbs of Maryland. A total of $125 million is provided for the construction of this light rail project. For the DC Metro system, this bill provides the eighth installment of $150 million in Federal dedicated funding. This is the fully authorized level and will be matched dollar for dollar by the three jurisdictions. Fighting for this annual appropriation was the promise I made and have kept since the deadly Fort Totten crash in June 2009. This funding must be used on capital improvements relating to safety including buying new rail cars, track improvements, and signal upgrades. I included bill language requiring the U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary to do three things before this funding money can be spent. First, the Secretary must approve each expenditure. Second, the Secretary must certify Metro is making progress implementing FTA's safety and financial management corrective actions. Third, the Secretary must determine that Metro is using this money for top safety priorities. In addition to this dedicated funding, I am proud of the safety amendment I introduced with Senators Shelby, Cardin, Warner, Kaine, and Brown that was passed earlier in the week. This amendment provides additional funding to FTA to expand its safety oversight workforce for a total increase of $5.25 million over the current year funding level. It will enable FTA to hire six full-time employees for Metro's Rail Operations Control Center, four more investigators, seven additional inspectors, and six more contractors. This additional funding means FTA will now have more inspectors to watch as Metro crews work to complete SafeTrack, the yearlong plan to accelerate repairs on the system. Inspectors will be there to make sure the track work is fixed the right way for good. FTA also will have safety staff at the Rail Operations Control Center 24 hours a day and 7 days a week making sure emergency procedures are followed to prevent future incidents. FTA staff will help Metro implement the National Transportation Safety Board's recent recommendations to overhaul the center's emergency operations and training. FTA staff will make sure these reforms remain in place and are followed. Finally, more investigators will help FTA tackle approximately 100 Metro investigations conducted each year. I also want to say a few words about the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. This is another bipartisan bill funding vital programs for the health and well-being of our Nation's veterans, troops, and their families developed by Senators Kirk and Tester. Overall, this bill provides $83 billion in discretionary funding which is an increase of $3.2 billion above the current year funding level. This bill fully funds VA Medical Services at the President's request of $52.8 billion. This is $1 billion over what we advanced last year to address increased demand for VA medical care both within and outside the VA health care system. The bill provides additional funding for disability claims processing. Significant progress has been made to eliminate the backlog in processing initial claims, but unfortunately, the backlog in appeals is rapidly building. This bill includes $2.9 billion for claims processing, $30 million above the request, to hire 300 new claims processors and 240 additional employees for the Board of Veterans Appeals. Also included is an increase of $46 million for the Board of Veterans Appeals, bringing their total funding to $156 million. This will provide for hiring an additional 240 new employees focused on appeals processing. For our women veterans, this bill makes significant strides bring parity between male and female veterans. This bill mandates that the VA research and acquire prosthetic devices specifically designed for women. It includes $5.3 billion overall to treat more than 500,000 female veterans who get care through the VA. This bill targets $535 million for gender-specific health care which is $20 million over the request and nearly $70 million over the current funding level. This includes gynecology, reproductive health, and mental health care for women. I also was proud to support Senator Murray's amendment in committee, allowing the VA to cover the cost of reproductive services for veterans who suffered service-related injuries that prevent them from starting families. The military construction part of this bill fully funds all seven Maryland projects included in the President's budget request. This means a total of $340 million for construction jobs at Fort Meade, Pax River, Joint Base Andrews, and Bethesda Medical Center. Finally, the bill includes $1.1 billion in emergency spending to combat the urgent Zika crisis. CDC, NIH, and USAID need this funding on the ground today. $1.1 billion is a bottom line, not a starting point for negotiation. I am committed to sending a Zika supplemental to the President as soon as possible. I urge all of my colleagues to support this package of bills. It meets many compelling human needs and physical infrastructure needs of our nation and does not include poison pill riders. It is an example of how, working together, we can solve problems and put America to work. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to speak in support of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs division of the substitute before us. I commend Chairman Kirk and Ranking Member Tester for their leadership in crafting the fiscal year 2017 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs funding bill. As a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, I have appreciated their steady, strong advocacy for our Nation's veterans, servicemembers, and their families. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I know well the sacrifices of those who serve and have served on our behalf, as well as the sacrifices made by their families. The vital programs and benefits funded by this bill will help fulfill our obligations to them and honor their commitment to our Nation. While we can never fully repay these debts, we must strive to provide each veteran with the quality health care that they deserve. One way this bill helps to meet this goal is through the extension it would provide of the highly successful Access Received Closer to Home, or ARCH, program. This pilot program, which is scheduled to expire in August, serves rural veterans in northern Maine, Montana, Kansas, Virginia, and Arizona, providing them access to high quality care in their communities and near their families. Many of my constituents tell me that this program has proven to be a lifeline for them and has saved them the arduous burden of traveling up to 600 miles round trip to receive care at the Togus VA Medical Center in Augusta, ME. In Maine, the program not only reduces wait times for appointments and prevents veterans from going through a third-party administrator to receive care, but it is cost effective. According to the VA's own statistics, the average cost of ARCH per veteran in Maine is less than half the average cost for VHA direct care. More than 90 percent of ARCH veterans are overwhelmingly satisfied with their care, a testament to why ARCH should be a model for the Nation. Ensuring that veterans continue to receive this seamless care is paramount, and I thank Chairman Kirk and Ranking Member Tester for including an extension of this vital program in the fiscal year 2017 funding legislation. I am also pleased that this legislation would fund the President's fiscal year 2017 request for VA medical leases, including funding to lease a new Community Based Outpatient Clinic--CBOC--facility in Portland, ME. This project would allow VA to consolidate and colocate the Saco and Portland CBOCs with Maine Medical Center and its affiliate, the Tufts University School of Medicine. This collaboration will provide primary care, mental health, women's health, and specialty care medical services for veterans. This legislation would also help to address the opioid epidemic by requiring the Department to improve appropriate pain care for veterans. It also includes programs to help end veteran homelessness, expand care services focused on our growing population of female veterans, and support caregivers, who shoulder the enormous responsibility of caring for veterans who are unable to care for themselves [[Page S3012]] Finally, I want to highlight the funding included in this legislation for our Nation's civilian and military members--and their families--who serve at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME. The legislation includes $74.9 million for housing, the replacement of the medical and dental clinic, and utility nuclear improvements. These projects will help provide the exceptional personnel at PNSY with the facilities they need and deserve to carry out the mission. Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their excellent work in balancing the priorities within their bill, and I urge my colleagues to advance this important legislation. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, universal, safe, and consistent trucking regulations are vital to all aspects of the trucking industry and to all users of the national highway system. Ensuring highway safety must remain a priority of this body. It also remains critical that this body maintain predictable safety laws to sustain efficient outcomes for truckers, trucking companies, the manufacturers and growers of the goods that trucks transport, and the customers who buy the products. Congress determined years ago that a uniform system of Federal trucking rules would lead to safer and more productive outcomes than a 50-State patchwork of trucking regulations, as goods are often transported across State lines. Despite Congress's intentions, we are seeing various State trucking rules being implemented across the country that stray from the Federal guidelines. We need to figure out how to address this. We need to make sure that we have commonsense rules that don't change every time a driver crosses a State line while continuing to protect truck drivers and road users from unsafe situations. I think we have got a little more work to do before we are ready for a solution, but I pledge to work with all who are willing and maybe we can figure something out in the coming months. Thank you. Maritime Security Program Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I join today with my good friend, Senator Hirono, to address the requirement for full authorized funding of the Maritime Security Program. Senator Hirono and I serve together on the Seapower Subcommittee and firmly believe that this program is important to our national security. The United States needs a U.S.-flag merchant marine that is strong, active, competitive, and useful to the military. Our merchant marine has a long history of providing sealift support to our Armed Forces for global military operations. The Maritime Security Program is a unique public-private partnership that helps the merchant marine, enhancing America's commercial sealift capability while saving the American taxpayer billions of dollars. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Seapower Subcommittee, I could not agree more with the Senator from Mississippi's views concerning the importance of the MSP program. The 60-ship MSP program is the most prudent and economical means to address the U.S. military's current and projected sealift requirements. A 2006 report prepared for the Military Sealift Committee of the National Defense Transportation Association concluded that ``the likely cost to the government to replicate just the vessel capacity provided by the MSP dry cargo vessels would be $13 billion.'' In addition, the U.S. Transportation Command, TransCom, has estimated that it would cost the U.S. Government an additional $52 billion to replicate the ``global intermodal system'' that is made available to the Department of Defense, DOD, by MSP participants. In contrast, MSP participants now provide DOD with the same vessels and global intermodal system at a fraction of what it would cost our government to do the job itself. Mr. WICKER. The Senate version of the Transportation-HUD Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2017 includes $275 million for the Maritime Security Program. This is an increase of $65 million above the enacted level for fiscal year 2016. Although we are pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee has recommended this increase in funding, we hasten to point out that Congress acted last December to increase the authorization level for the Maritime Security Program to $299,997,000 for fiscal year 2017. The House Appropriations Committee has recommended funding for the next fiscal year that would meet this authorization. As this appropriations bill works its way through Congress, we urge the chairs and ranking members of the Transportation-HUD Appropriations Subcommittees and the full Appropriations Committee to work in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to provide funding for the Maritime Security Program at its fully authorized level of $299,997,000 for fiscal year 2017. Ms. HIRONO. I strongly agree with Senator Wicker. Despite the clear benefits the MSP program provides, the MSP commercial fleet is under extreme economic pressure from reductions in government-impelled cargoes and foreign competitive factors. I completely share the concerns expressed by the then-TransCom commander, GEN Paul Selva, in his March 2015 testimony before the Armed Services Committee, where he stated that the ``reduction in government impelled cargoes due to the drawdown in Afghanistan and reductions in food aid . . .are driving vessel owners to reflag to non-U.S.-flag out of economic necessity . . .With the recent vessel reductions, the mariner base is at the point where future reductions in U.S.-flag capacity puts our ability to fully activate, deploy and sustain forces at increased risk.'' Accordingly, to ensure that this essential U.S. commercial sealift capability provided by the MSP program remains available to meet America's national security requirements, the MSP program needs to be fully funded as authorized by the Congress. Mr. WICKER. I would like to add a comment from the current TransCom commander, GEN Darren McDew. In January, General McDew said, ``As a military professional and senior leader, I think about and plan for what the future may hold, and I would tell you we must prepare for the real possibility we will not enjoy the uncontested seas and broad international support experienced in 1991. If either of those possibilities becomes reality, and if we remain committed to responding to security incidents around the globe, the only way of guaranteeing we decisively meet our national objectives is with U.S. ships operated by U.S. mariners.'' I thank Senator Hirono for joining me in this effort to ensure that full funding is secured for the Maritime Security Program in fiscal year 2017. Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. U.S. Innovation and Competitiveness Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the need to drive innovation and competitiveness here in the United States. I vividly remember watching the Apollo missions on TV and the launch of that 36-story tall Saturn V rocket that took Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the surface of the Moon. The space program not only inspired a generation of Americans, but it also led to incredible advances in science and technology that over the last 50 years have accounted for as much as half of all the economic growth in the United States. These groundbreaking advances firmly established our Nation as an international leader in innovation. During the height of the space race, America's Federal investment in research and development reached nearly 2 percent of the Nation's GDP. Today, overall Federal R&D spending--the seed corn of our future prosperity--has fallen to a historic low of 0.78 percent of GDP. With the United States investing less on science, research, and education, and our competitors outpacing us, we are losing our footing in the global marketplace. Congress must increase the Federal investment in R&D to 1 percent of GDP if we want to continue to be leading the world in innovation. This commitment should include a focus on increased Federal support for basic research--an essential component of any kind of innovation economy. [[Page S3013]] In addition to increased investment, we in Congress need to implement policy solutions that will reassert American leadership internationally. We need to invest in what works. We need to listen to the innovators, academic leaders, and industries that are making the life-changing inventions of the future a reality. To that end, my colleague Senator Cory Gardner and I have convened a series of roundtable discussions on ways to improve the American innovation system. Just last week, our Commerce Committee leaders, Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson, held a productive hearing on ways to leverage the U.S. science and technology enterprise. After receiving input from industry, academia, science organizations, and economic development organizations, Senators Thune, Nelson, Gardner, and I are working to develop new legislation to guide our Nation's research priorities in the coming years and to improve America's innovation system. Through these roundtables, we heard that the stakeholder community agrees that modest, sustained, and predictable increases in Federal research and development investments are absolutely critical to ensuring the economic competitiveness of the United States. We need continued Federal investment in basic research, while also providing opportunities to commercialize that research. There is basic research that our companies simply cannot afford to conduct, making Federal investment absolutely critical. We also need to work to reduce administrative burdens on researchers so that we can maximize our Federal research investment. We need that investment to be put into the lab and not filling out more paperwork. We need stronger partnerships between government, the private sector, and academia in order to capitalize on discoveries emerging from our world-class research universities, such as the University of Michigan, Wayne State University, and Michigan State University. We must also close the significant employment gap in the STEM workforce for women and underrepresented minorities. Women make up less than 50 percent of post-bachelor STEM degree programs and only about one-quarter of the STEM workforce. Underrepresented minorities, including Hispanics and African Americans, make up about 10 percent of the science and engineering workforce. Last month, I joined a number of my colleagues in introducing the STEM Opportunities Act, legislation that would improve inclusion of women, minorities, and people with disabilities in STEM careers. It is a top priority for me to see that a similar provision is included in our bipartisan legislation. Finally, if we want to continue to be a leader in the global economy, we need to be a nation that makes things. Michigan is a State that builds and grows things, and I will continue to fight to make sure we continue doing that. Investments in advanced manufacturing will support firms of all sizes and support good-paying jobs and help keep them here in the United States. That is why it is one of my top priorities for this legislation that we ensure American manufacturing companies can compete and succeed in the highly competitive global marketplace. Last month, I joined my colleagues, Senators Coons and Ayotte, to introduce the bipartisan Manufacturing Extension Partnership Improvement Act. The Manufacturing Extension Program, or MEP, is a Federal public-private partnership that helps businesses get their products to market through a variety of consulting services. The MEP Improvement Act would expand and improve the MEP Program to serve small- and medium-sized manufacturing companies, which are a critical part of our economy and our national competitiveness. Including key components of the MEP Improvement Act will be a top priority for me in the new legislation being drafted. Science and technology are inseparable from the American competitiveness ecosystem. However, we need to focus on the entire ecosystem--from STEM, or STEAM, to basic research, to application and commercialization--and the inspiration that drives ambitious endeavors like exploring space and the other frontiers of science. We in Congress must do our part by supporting and investing in our efforts to drive economic growth, unleash increased productivity, enhance our safety and security, and make the world a better place for future generations. We are facing big challenges as a Nation, but I am committed to working with everyone--Democrats, Republicans, industry, academia, workers, students, and employers--to increase investments and implement the solutions that will ensure American competitiveness and create more good-paying jobs here in the United States. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if there is one specialty that every Member of Congress has, it is air travel. We spend more time on airplanes, more time in airports, more time waiting for flights and worrying about flights than most other Americans. As Members of Congress, we are veterans of air travel. We have all seen the footage of people waiting to go through security screening at major airports, particularly in the city of Chicago at both O'Hare and Midway. The lines are so long that people have had to wait 2 to 3 hours--2 to 3 hours to go through a security checkpoint. People are angry, and I don't blame them. Thousands of people have missed their flights, and some were stuck sleeping in airports overnight. The commissioner of aviation, Ginger Evans, told me: We pulled out the cots that we save for snow emergencies so that people now, in the heat of early summer, are facing the same kinds of delays. Our highest priority is to protect those who travel on our airplanes. Poor planning and inadequate funding have led to alarming delays across airports in America, and in Chicago we have felt it more than most. More needs to be done to fix the problem. That is what I have been working to do. Earlier this week, I talked to the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on the phone about the next steps. Yesterday, I followed up with a call to TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger to hear his thoughts. We all agree that the real problem is the shortage of TSA screeners. More people need to be hired and trained so security lines can stay open and people can move through the checkpoints faster. In the meantime, there are immediate steps we need to take in Chicago. First, we are going to get 58 more TSA screening officers in the next 2 weeks and 224 by August. That is about a 15-percent increase in TSA staff, and it is a good start. O'Hare will also receive 5 K-9 teams. That will double the number of K-9s we have at the airport. Two teams were brought in yesterday, and the rest will arrive within 5 days. These bomb-sniffing dogs do important work. They check carry-on baggage. If there is no problem, the passengers can move out of the standard line and into the expedited line. These dogs can help us speed up the process by allowing up to 5,000 additional passengers a day to move through the faster security lines. There will also be a shift of 100 TSA staff from part-time to full- time status so more people can be on deck to help with the lines. And officers who currently work on nondirect security functions are going to be called to pitch in and help officers at the checkpoints. We are also working to get more people enrolled in TSA PreCheck. I can't emphasize enough how important that is. For $85, a regular traveler can buy--or at least apply for and be given--a TSA PreCheck status for 5 years. PreCheck lines can scan nearly twice as fast as the ordinary lines. Customers don't have to wait as long or remove their shoes, belts, or light jackets. We need to make sure more people are hearing about this option and are signing up for it as quickly as possible. TSA is now working on a mobile app to help people get enrolled while they are waiting in lines, and they are also looking at lowering PreCheck signup costs by competing out the actual function of signing up for PreCheck. [[Page S3014]] PreCheck has gotten a lot of traction, especially in Chicago, where this past month alone we have seen 5,700 new enrollments. I hope we can continue to quickly expand this program to help more people into the faster lines. The airlines have to be part of the solution as well. I am glad Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut is on the floor because both he and Senator Markey of Massachusetts spoke out early on this aspect that I am about to address. Airlines can help us by reducing high wait times, especially during the peak summer season. I have joined my colleagues Senator Blumenthal and Senator Markey in urging the airlines to suspend the checked bag fees over the summer. A lot of people are dragging their bags on the airplanes because they don't want to pay to have them checked. On Monday, I spoke with Secretary Johnson, who told me baggage fees are contributing to long lines because more people are carrying on luggage that should be carefully screened through check-in. Over the last year, the volume of passengers and personnel passing through security checkpoints has increased 7 percent while the number of checked bags has increased only 3 percent. That tells the story: More people are carrying on their luggage and causing problems as more travelers pack their roller bags to the brim, making the bags take even longer to be scanned. Waiving the checked baggage fee during the summer travel season can reduce the incentive for passengers to carry-on luggage, and it can help speed up the process. Let me also add that it is in this baggage that people are dragging onboard that TSA screeners are finding things that aren't supposed to be on an airplane. Last year, they found 2,653 firearms, and 83 percent of them were loaded. Most of them were from one State; I will not name it. But by and large, we have to be more mindful of the fact that this stops the process or at least slows it down. I am convening a meeting with Administrator Neffenger tomorrow, along with State and local officials and airlines at Chicago O'Hare, and then we are also going to be visiting the Midway airport. We will see firsthand what airlines are experiencing and what their response is. We have to stop this meltdown when it comes to airport security. Let me close by saying this: The news today about EgyptAir was a grim reminder that we still live in a very dangerous world. The role and responsibility of the Transportation Security Agency is to make sure that when we and our families travel, we come off those planes just as safely as we went on. It is an important security responsibility. Yes, it is an irritation and a frustration, but we need to do it in this dangerous world to make sure that we stop people from using their carry-on baggage and other sources to cause harm to innocent people. I stand behind TSA and its mission, but what happened in Chicago is unacceptable. This meltdown should have been avoided. There should have been better management, more screeners, and we should have been ready for the surge in passengers. Beginning this week, we are going to make that right. I hope the visit by the TSA Administrator tomorrow will be the beginning of a conversation that will not only help our airports in Chicago but also help our Nation. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from Illinois for his leadership on this issue and his support for the initiative that Senator Markey and I first raised, which he has supported so very helpfully, and essentially that is to persuade the airlines to stop charging for bags that are checked onto planes as opposed to being carried on. Obviously, the fee for checking those bags adds to the number of carry-ons and provides an incentive for larger numbers of carry-ons. In fact, TSA itself reports that there has been an increase in carry-ons due to these fees. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank the Presiding Officer. The elimination of the fees for checked bags is not a panacea. It is not going to solve this problem alone. But it will, along with other measures, help reduce lines that result from screening. I commend Admiral Neffenger for his very close and prompt attention to this matter and for a number of the initiatives he has taken. We heard about them in the Commerce Committee this morning. I also thank Secretary Johnson for supporting elimination of the fees for checked bags. I think his leadership will be important. There are a number of other initiatives that can and should be taken. There is automated equipment that can expedite the screening of those carry-on bags. The use of additional screeners is important. The number has been reduced over the last 3 years by about 5,800. The addition of another close to 800 will help compensate. But again, alone, none of these solutions will provide the answer. As far as the automated equipment is concerned, the cost for the 20 busiest airports is about $30 million--a pittance compared to the $3.8 billion in revenue the airlines make every year as a result of the fees for checked baggage. I will repeat that: $3.8 billion is going to airlines as a result of their purposefully charging for bags checked instead of carried on. Many of those bags that go through screening now wind up in the holds of those airplanes anyway because there isn't room for them on the plane, so they wind up being checked at the gate. That simply adds to the cost and inconvenience of passengers: delayed flights, missed flights, flights that are in effect late because of the boarding problems. All of these accumulating issues are reasons to eliminate these fees and also give passengers the benefit of lower costs. My hope is that the airlines will voluntarily eliminate these fees for checked bags. After the meeting we had today with Admiral Neffenger, I am encouraged that the TSA will take initiative and help to implement other measures as well. In the meantime, we need the airlines to show some leadership as well, and I am hopeful they will do the right thing. The U.S. Travel Association has called it a national crisis. The evidence is irrefutable. At checkpoints that have no fee charges for bags, the carry-ons are 27 percent lower, so the numbers of carry-ons definitely diminish as the fees are eliminated. This evidence is irrefutable and argues powerfully that the airlines should not keep their passengers waiting in line. They should make some sacrifice to their bottom line and should not be profiting at the expense of their passengers. I will conclude by saying on this point--and I am so glad to see my colleague and friend from Massachusetts--that we need this initiative now, and we need it to happen. I also want to advocate on behalf of the safety of our roads. Blumenthal amendment No. 4002 will not be called up in part because it had been willfully mischaracterized by an industry campaign. In effect, we need to make truck drivers more safely empowered on the roads to take steps to protect themselves. Drivers who spend too much time behind the wheel are tired. They can't drive as safely. This amendment would enable them to drive more safely, give them the rest they need, protect them, and enable the roads to be safer not only for them but for people generally. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I yield to Senator Markey. Mr. MARKEY. I just want to thank the Senator for his work. We have been partnering on this issue of eliminating bag fees at airports. Since they have been imposed, 27 percent more bags now go through baggage clearing with passengers. If we could just get that out of the way, get rid of those baggage fees, I think it would expedite dramatically the ability of people to get on planes in this country. So I am glad we are able to have this moment to be able to speak about the importance of this issue. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, the Senator from Massachusetts and I have been partners in this effort, and I hope we can prevail. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. [[Page S3015]] Amendment No. 3970 to Amendment No. 3896 Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I call up the Collins-Reed-Cochran amendment No. 3970. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment numbered 3970 to amendment No. 3896. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to carry out a final rule and notice of the Department of Housing and Urban Development) At the appropriate place in division A, insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to direct a grantee to undertake specific changes to existing zoning laws as part of carrying out the final rule entitled ``Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing'' (80 Fed. Reg. 42272 (July 16, 2015)) or the notice entitled ``Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Assessment Tool'' (79 Fed. Reg. 57949 (September 26, 2014)). Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the amendment that Senator Jack Reed, Senator Thad Cochran, and I are offering would make very clear that none of the funds made available in this appropriations bill can be used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to direct a recipient of Federal funds to undertake changes to their zoning laws. There has been concern that some have brought up that a new rule that was issued last year by the Department would somehow allow HUD to be the national zoning authority for every neighborhood in our country. While I do not believe that is a correct interpretation of the fair housing amendment or regulation that HUD has promulgated, the Collins- Reed-Cochran amendment ensures that HUD cannot do that. It eliminates that possibility and ensures that communities will continue to make their own decisions to address these Federal requirements. By contrast, the proposal offered by my colleague from Utah, Senator Lee, would prohibit all funding for a rule that was issued by HUD based on a requirement that is included in the landmark civil rights era law known as the Fair Housing Act of 1968. It is important to know that this regulation was in direct response to a 2010 GAO report that criticized HUD's implementation of the requirement of the law that grantees, recipients of these funds, affirmatively enhance fair housing opportunities. It also was issued in response to requests from communities seeking guidance to ensure compliance because they don't want to be sued for inadvertently violating Fair Housing Act requirements. So communities asked HUD for more tools, better assessments, and more guidance to make sure that they were in compliance. It is important to know that the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination not only based on race, national origin, and religion but also against those with disabilities. Indeed, 56 percent of the complaints of housing discrimination have been initiated by individuals with disabilities. That is why Senator Lee's amendment is opposed by the Paralyzed Veterans of America and other disability groups, as well as the Urban League, the NAACP, and countless civil rights groups. On the first vote, we will be voting on the Collins-Reed-Cochran amendment. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Will Senator Collins yield briefly for a question? Ms. COLLINS. Yes, I will yield. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Senator Collins and every member of this body know that I support fair housing. It is so important for my State, where there is a lack of affordable housing, and the Anchorage School District is one of the most diverse in the Nation. However, I have heard concerns from people in Alaska. They worry not so much about the rule itself but about how HUD could implement it. Many communities in Alaska are overwhelmingly Alaska Native, 90 percent or more of the population. Will this affirmatively furthering fair housing rule result in Federal grants being withheld from communities that are currently and have long been populated almost entirely by Alaska Natives because those communities are now considered to be segregated? Ms. COLLINS. No community in the United States or its insular areas will lose Federal housing funds solely because of its racial demographics. There are communities throughout the United States that are racially homogenous for reasons that have nothing to do with discrimination or other historic barriers. The rule does not change the Fair Housing Act, which for decades has included the affirmative fair housing requirement. The whole purpose of the rule is to ensure that States and communities that receive Federal funds take this requirement seriously. This rule is a planning tool, created to help grantees identify barriers to fair housing and plan how to address them. The rule does not penalize any community for where it starts but rather assists a community in taking meaningful steps to address any barriers it may find. HUD would never deny Federal funds to a community simply because of its demographics. It has never done so in the 48 years since the passage of the Fair Housing Act, and it will not under this rule. Additionally, I know some have expressed concern about what effect this rule would have on Alaskan Natives and other Native Americans. HUD's housing programs for Native Alaskans and other Native Americana are authorized under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act, NAHASDA. NAHASDA includes a statutory exemption from the Fair Housing Act, which the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule does not change. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule, which my amendment would defund, is equal parts condescension and willful blindness. The condescension of this particular rule and its proponents is that local governments and public housing authorities across America can't figure out how to provide fair and affordable housing to their communities without the help, without the paternalistic interference of Federal bureaucrats. This is the epitome of the paternalism that informs so much of what happens in Washington, DC, today. I don't doubt, as Senator Collins has said repeatedly, that local governments would like ``better guidance'' from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington. But this is a problem that was created by HUD, with its onerous requirements and its vague mandates, not the result of local governments being unable or unwilling to provide adequate low-cost housing for their neighbors in need. This brings us to the willful blindness part of the affirmative furthering fair housing rule. Proponents of the rule claim that HUD officials consulted closely with local governments and public housing authorities when drafting and finalizing the AFFH rule. In their telling, local housing agencies across the country are welcoming the AFFH rule with open arms. But this ignores what local officials have actually said about AFFH. I will let these local officials speak for themselves. Roger Partridge, the county commissioner of Douglas County, CO, had this to say, in an email, about AFFH, the closed process that produced it, and the immense burdens it will place on local governments: Douglas County believes that the Assessment of Fair Housing tool as it now stands is an unfunded mandate that will create an administrative nightmare for jurisdictions who want to further fair housing and implement community programs with HUD grants. Partridge continues: HUD headquarters has repeatedly ignored the local practitioners responsible for AFFH and implementing the AFH in our communities. He continues: In fact, HUD headquarters staff was in Denver for a Public AFFH roundtable on April 21st, during [the AFH tool] comment period. They ignored the opportunity to inform Region VIII Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) staff or the local practitioners attending the roundtable. No notice from the HUD EXCHANGE to the grantee list serve was found. The local governments who were asked to comment on the publication were shut out of the process. Likewise, this is what we have heard from Salt Lake County officials: The administrative burden imposed by this tool is excessive. Resources that could be put [[Page S3016]] into housing related tasks are being funneled into completing the tool and its associated administrative tasks. Additionally, although HUD claims that this tool can be completed without the use of a consultant, the assessment is complex enough to warrant considering a consultant. The rule imposes a jurisdictional and regional analysis that is too complex to be effectively completed by staff without specific statistical and mapping knowledge. As housing providers, most staff at PHAs have comparative advantages that lie in providing affordable housing services, but not providing complex statistical data analysis. Forcing PHA staff to do this analysis is an inefficient use of their scarce time. Salt Lake County officials added the following: The AFH does not recognize the zero-sum nature of a PHA's resource allocation. By allocating resources to complete this process, PHAs are not allocating resources somewhere else. Those resources could be used to provide additional housing assistance. Instead of ignoring the words and the experiences of our local officials, and instead of condescending to them, we should listen to them and learn from them. We should stop this disastrous new housing rule from causing more problems than it has already caused. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Alabama is going to speak, and the Senator from Rhode Island should have an opportunity to speak. So I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute for each side prior to the votes in this series. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Lee's amendment that would prevent the implementation of HUD's affirmatively furthering fair housing regulation. Contrary to statements that have been made, the Senator's amendment does nothing to change fair housing laws or to prevent the enforcement thereof. What the Lee amendment does is to prevent the implementation of a rule that would give HUD Federal control over local planning decisions. Supporters of this program have argued that it is intended to protect communities from fair housing lawsuits. It is quite the contrary. This rule, if allowed to be implemented, will actually lay the predicate for endless litigation against every community in our respective States that are required to participate. This should be unacceptable to every Member of this body. Supporting Senator Lee's amendment is the only option before us to prevent centralized Federal control of local planning decisions. In my judgment, the Collins-Reed amendment does nothing to restrain the full implementation of HUD's program. I urge my colleagues to support the Lee amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. REED. Mr. President, the pending amendment is authored by my colleague from Maine and myself. The amendment makes very clear that local officials will remain in charge of zoning decisions and will determine how to best meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act. Those obligations are fundamental to our American fabric, our lives, and the aspirations of this country, because they protect Americans' housing choices no matter their physical ability, race, family status, or religion. These protections are fundamental to who we are. But without effective information and transparency so that local communities can make wise decisions, these aspirations can never be realized, are seldom realized, or are not realized to the extent that we, as Americans, feel that they should be. Senator Collins and I have worked very hard to develop language that provides local communities with wide flexibility to meet their requirements under the Fair Housing Act. Those requirements will still be there regardless of our action today. If the resources made available under the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing regulations are not provided, however, those communities will still be required to ensure that housing is available within their communities, regardless of race, physical ability, or the other protected classes under the law. The Lee amendment would make grantees liable for compliance without providing the data and tools needed to comply. The thrust--the heart and soul--of this HUD proposal, based on GAO analysis, is to give local communities the tools, so that they can determine the local answer that makes sense. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 4 minutes equally divided on the Collins amendment. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Let me just reiterate what I have been saying repeatedly. What the amendment Senator Reed, Senator Cochran, and I have introduced does is make very clear that HUD is prohibited from intervening in local decisions regarding zoning ordinances. That is in direct response to what some people have been claiming, incorrectly in my view; that the rule on affirmatively furthering fair housing would somehow allow HUD to be a national zoning commissar. That is not the case, but to make absolutely sure that could never happen, we have teamed up on this amendment to prohibit HUD from intervening in local zoning matters. It is very different from the Lee amendment, which we will discuss shortly. This is an important clarification that should take away any fear that there is any possibility of HUD using funds authorized by this bill to interfere in local zoning decisions. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Maine in and of itself is unobjectionable and does no harm, and on that basis I intend to vote for it. Unfortunately, it also doesn't do anything. It does nothing to help the many housing agencies that have told the Federal Government that President Obama's AFFH rule imposes far too many reporting costs and their already stretched staffs are going to suffer as a result. It does nothing to shield local housing authorities from the very many real lawsuits they will face as a result of the data collected from this regulation, and it does nothing to stop HUD from blackmailing local housing agencies with Community Development Block Grant Program funds. At this time, I wish to cede the remainder of my time to my friend, the senior Senator from Alabama. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we should all be aware that the Collins- Reed amendment provides no protections to local communities on their local planning rules because it merely prohibits an activity that the rule does not contemplate. Even the sponsor of this amendment acknowledged earlier today that the amendment prohibited an activity that she believed would not occur. Make no mistake that the so-called affirmatively furthering fair housing rule will likely heavily influence local zoning decisions. However, it does so indirectly, not through direct action as in the Collins-Reed amendment. HUD advertises this fact on its own Web site, where it details how communities will have to submit for approval an assessment of fair housing and that these communities will ``use the fair housing goals and priorities established in their [assessment] to inform the investments and other decisions made in their local planning processes.'' In other words, HUD does not intend to direct any specific zoning requirements. It does, however, intend to significantly influence local zoning decisions by withholding approval of local plans until they meet HUD's central planning goals. This amendment is not sufficient on its own. I believe the only way to prevent HUD from intruding into local community planning exactly as they openly state they intend to do is to support the Lee amendment. I believe the Collins-Reed amendment is not alternative to Senator Lee's amendment, it is, at best, complementary to the Lee amendment, and that is something we will have to vote on in just a few minutes. I thank the Presiding Officer. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of time on our side, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? [[Page S3017]] There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Mr. DURBIN: I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Heinrich), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.

Amendment No. 3897 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). There is now 4 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the Lee amendment No. 3897. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the subsequent votes in this series be 10 minutes in length. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, unlike the Collins amendment that just passed with broad support, my amendment would actually do something with respect to affirmatively furthering the fair housing rule. Specifically, it would defund this rule and ultimately force the Department of Housing and Urban Development to respond to the GAO in a way that does not undermine local control or increase costs on already stretched thin local housing agencies. My colleagues who oppose this amendment have given a number of examples of local governments being newly connected to make better governing decisions, but my amendment in no way stops local governments from continuing to do that. All my amendment does--the only thing it does--is to prevent the Federal Government from forcing local governments to comply with a costly and unnecessary new data collection program, and it does so in order to protect local autonomy. I therefore encourage each of my colleagues to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my colleague Senator Lee would prohibit all funding for a fair housing regulation issued by HUD based on a requirement of a landmark civil rights law, the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Not only was this not a regulation that appeared out of thin air, the GAO did a report criticizing HUD, and once the regulation was implemented, closed the recommendation. In addition, communities asked HUD to issue better guidance on this part of the law so that they could avoid being sued under the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I move to table the Lee amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number: Amendment No. 4050, offered by Senator Rubio; and amendment No. 4026, as modified, offered by Senator Baldwin. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the amendments en bloc by number. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for others, proposes amendments numbered 4050 and 4026, as modified, en bloc to amendment No. 3896.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before I make some closing remarks, I would yield to Senator Reed, who has been such an extraordinary partner as we have worked together in a transparent and collaborative way to bring this bill across the finish line. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me return the compliment to the Chairman of the committee, Senator Collins of Maine, for her extraordinary insight, leadership, and ability to bring us together. This bill reflects the priorities of members on both sides of the aisle, it reflects sound policy, and it was a pleasure to work with her. I think that she will also commend our extraordinary staffs who provided support, working many times when we were not working to get the job done. I thank Dabney Hegg, Heideh Shahmoradi, Christina Monroe, Nathan Robinson, Jordan Stone, Jason Woolwine, Mike Clarke, Lydia Collins, and Gus Maples. These are professionals who are thoughtful, skillful, pleasant, and probably deserving of the real praise for work done on the floor. Let me once again thank Senator Collins for her thoughtful leadership and her commitment to fairness and principle. I think that she is one of the major reasons we are here today. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senate has completed its consideration of this appropriations measure, which provides essential funding for the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, related agencies, military construction programs, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and to combat Zika. I thank all of my colleagues for working together with us in an open and collaborative manner. I would note that the legislation we just passed incorporates some 40 [[Page S3019]] amendments. There were also recommendations from more than 75 Senators from both sides of the aisle included in the Transportation-HUD appropriations portion of this bill which were incorporated at the committee level. I thank all of my colleagues for giving us their suggestions, their requests, and their insights. It made for a better bill. As I mentioned, I am particularly grateful to Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Transportation-HUD Subcommittee, for his work. I also thank the staff for their diligence and commitment throughout this process. As Senator Reed mentioned, we worked extremely hard, but our staff worked even harder. So I thank Heideh Shahmoradi, Rajat Mathur, Jason Woolwine, Lydia Collins, Gus Maples, Dabney Hegg, Nathan Robinson, Christina Monroe, Jordan Stone, and Mike Clarke on the subcommittee staff. I also give special thanks to the floor and cloakroom staffs who worked so hard. Without the help of Laura Dove and her team and the team on the Democratic side, we could not be where we are today. They did a lot of the vetting that needed to be done on various amendments. They helped us in the negotiations and compromises that ultimately were included in this bill. I would note that our Transportation-HUD portion of this bill recognizes the fiscal reality while making critical investments into our crumbling infrastructure and economic development projects. It meets our responsibility to vulnerable populations. I think most of our colleagues are unaware that 84 percent of HUD's budget goes to subsidized housing. When we fund that, we keep very vulnerable low- income families, disabled individuals, and our low-income seniors from being at risk of homelessness. We also paid special attention in this bill to vulnerable homeless populations, such as our veterans and our young people. We continued a program the administration wanted to abolish that helps our homeless veterans, to whom we owe so much--$57 million in new vouchers, so that we can continue the progress we are making in housing our homeless veterans. Since we started this program, the number of homeless veterans has declined by about one-third. This program works, but we can't declare victory until the job is done. That is why both last year and this year we funded the program, even though the President's budget sought to eliminate it. We have made real investments in helping some of our most vulnerable young people, and those are youth who have been in the Foster Care Program and then age out of that program. In some cases, they are aging out of the program before they have even graduated from high school, and they have nowhere to go. So through family reunification vouchers and other programs, we are beefing up support so they don't fall through the cracks and become vulnerable to traffickers, to dropping out of school, to couch surfing, or ending up in shelters. In particular, I am very proud of the work we have done in that area. I am very pleased this bill funds the TIGER Grant Program at $525 million. This program has been extraordinarily popular and effective. It has funded projects in each and every State--projects that have led to job creation and economic development. When we think about it, at heart, much in this bill is about creating jobs and security for our fellow citizens. If you don't have a place to live, it is very difficult to show up for work every day. If the infrastructure is crumbling, it is very difficult for a business to hire the employees who produce the products and get those products to market. The construction projects this bill will fund creates good-paying jobs. In many ways, I think of this as a jobs bill. Let me give another example of a very popular program, the Community Development Block Grant Program. If you ask of the mayors and other town and city officials in your State, they will point to that program as one that gives them the flexibility to improve their downtowns, to make investments that bring new employers to the region, to build affordable housing, whatever their needs are, and that is the beauty of that program. It is not dictated from Washington. It gives tremendous flexibility to States and communities to design the kinds of economic development programs that boost growth and create jobs. In short, our bill strikes the right balance between thoughtful investment and fiscal restraint and thereby sets the stage for future economic growth, something I know the Presiding Officer has been a real leader in speaking out about and reminding us that must be our focus as Members of the Senate. I am also pleased we were able to bring spending bills to the floor for Members to examine, debate, and vote on in a transparent manner. The worst situation is when we do a series of continuing resolutions temporarily funding the essential functions of government. They create such uncertainty, they lock in priorities from previous years rather than reflecting today's priorities, and they end up costing more money. Agencies are unable to enter into contracts. Businesses, because of the uncertainty, tend to build in a little extra into their bids. It is a terrible way to operate. Equally bad is the practice of bundling all 12 of the appropriations bills into one gigantic omnibus bill, thousands of pages long, that is rushed through at the end of the fiscal year--or, more often, at the expiration of one of those continuing resolutions that I just deplore. We are not doing that this year. This is the third appropriations bill that the Senate has passed earlier than ever, with great cooperation from both sides of the aisle. The Members of the Appropriations Committee and its two leaders, Senator Cochran and Senator Mikulski, deserve great credit for putting us on a strict schedule and keeping the process moving. In fact, in the full committee today, we approved two more appropriations bills that are ready to come to the Senate floor. That is the way the process used to work. That is the way the process should work, and that is the way the process is working this year. I believe it is a great credit to the Senate, to the leaders of the Appropriations Committee, and to Majority Leader McConnell, who has made it a goal that all 12 bills be reported by the Appropriations Committee and brought to the Senate floor, individually or two or three combined, for full and open debate. Again, I thank Members on both sides of the aisle. Many of your requests are included in this important legislation. I feel fortunate to have worked with Senator Jack Reed on this bill. He is not only a great colleague and a terrific Senator but also a good friend. ____________________",package_114_17.csv,124260,124260,124327,"[congressional record volume 162, number 80 (thursday,

the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. booker. mr. president, i appreciate seeing the presiding officer in the chair and having a ``corey'' represented and presiding over the u.s. senate. i rise today to speak against an amendment now pending to this bill that would block a rule that seeks to fulfill the promise of the fair housing act. this issue is very deeply personal to me and one that really has defined my own personal history. i would like to start by telling a story. in 1969, just 1 year after the passage of the fair housing act, a couple here in washington, dc, married with two boys, decided to move to new jersey. in new jersey, they encountered a lot of a practice called real estate steering, where black couples were steered away from certain neighborhoods. realizing they were being steered away from white neighborhoods, they grew frustrated, and they sought the help of the fair housing council. they set up an elaborate sting operation where my parents would go look at a home--or this couple would go look at a home--and they would then be followed by a white couple. the couple was told the house was sold or it was not for sale. the white couple would then appear and find out if that was, indeed, true. most often for this couple from washington, dc, yes, they would find out the house was still for sale. eventually this couple found a house they loved in a small town called harrington park, nj, but they were told that the house was not for sale. they were told the house had been pulled off the market or sold. they left. then the white couple came behind them. lo and behold, the house had not been sold or was not pulled off the market. the white couple pretended that they loved the house as the black couple did and put a bid on the house. the bid was accepted. on the day of the closing, instead of the white couple showing up, the african-american gentleman from the black couple and a volunteer lawyer came to confront the real estate agent. the real estate agent was so upset that he stood up and punched the lawyer representing the black couple and sicced his dog on the african-american man. yet the law was on their side. the fair housing law of the united states of america, the law of the federal government, was on their side. eventually, that black couple and their two kids moved into that home in harrington park, nj. that was 1969. it was the year i was born, and that couple was my parents, cary and carolyn booker. that is my origin story. legislation that this body passed empowered my family to move into the home of their dreams in an all-white neighborhood with incredibly good schools that i went through from k-12. i am the beneficiary of work this body did to ensure that our american values are preserved, our values of inclusion and integration, to make sure fair housing is the law of the land. that work gave me my start in life. the activism of local activists, combined with the law of the land as passed by us, defined my path. after decades of struggle in communities across the country, we have largely been successful in banning overt housing discrimination. we [[page s3005]] should be proud of our work. but legislation that we passed should not become a relic of history. it is not something for us to turn and admire. we all know on many issues the cause of freedom and the cause of justice necessitate constant vigilance. so i rise today with the knowledge that while major pieces of civil rights legislation like the fair housing act have had a significant impact on millions of americans--white, black, latino, asian, disabled--this has had a full impact. we still have work to do to continue that vigilance to make sure that those values, those ideals, and the law of the land are made real for families. unfortunately, for nearly 50 years there has not been real guidance, direction, or tools to help local officials achieve the goals of the fair housing act, which are integrated housing, fair housing, equal access. in 2010, in fact, the government accountability office found that the department of housing and urban development, hud, failed to properly administer oversight obligations under the fair housing act and failed to monitor its guarantees for compliance with the law. in 2013, hud proposed affirmatively furthering fair housing, a new rule that would seek to fulfill the promise of the fair housing act and eliminate a lot of the historic patterns of segregation that still go on in america today. the vision for the rule is to institute a data- driven analysis of localities and to develop federal grant programs for housing and economic inclusion. when i was mayor, people came to me with passions and accusations and the like. i used to always say: in god we trust, but, everybody else, bring me data. it is important to look at the numbers to know what really is going on. so hud brought about this idea of making sure we have that data--not in a rushed process. the administration engaged in a diligent 2-year rulemaking process with public inclusion, participation from others, and lots of public comment periods. they finalized that rule in july 2015. it is unfortunate that one of my dear colleagues--somebody whom i value very much because we do a lot of work across the aisle--has introduced an amendment that would block this rule's implementation, and i must respectfully disagree with the intent of this amendment. the fair housing act and, really, the entirety of the civil rights act were meant, again, to be real today, not just relics of yesterday. they were meant to be guideposts and standards by which we hold ourselves accountable for the values we put forth. the affirmatively further fair housing rule is a measure of accountability for hud and for ourselves. you cannot change what you cannot measure. let me say that again. i learned this as a manager: if you can't measure it, you can't change it or affect it. the rule will arm communities most in need with knowledge and numbers so they can make intelligent local decisions and best apply their resources. it is what everyone who has to manage something needs: accurate data. it will improve the access to quality data on local demographics and streamline the process for analyzing local fair housing impediments, helping grantees establish their own local fair housing priorities. this rule does not interfere with local zoning or housing laws, and it prevents further taxpayer dollars from being used to discriminate. every stakeholder--every one of us--is afforded an opportunity to comment on the rule that hud made, and, as a former local leader, it empowers people at the localities to do justice by their communities. this is a balanced and a measured rule, and it takes up the cause of the work to make our country more and more just. i know personally that so much of the character of our country comes from the values we have as a whole. there are rare times in our history where this body is called upon to affirm those values. this body's history--the noble history of this body--is something i have benefited from personally around fair housing. now we have more tools necessary, with big data and analysis, to more effectively and affirmatively assert our values and ensure injustice is not being done. i want to make sure that we defeat this amendment for those reasons. i believe and know the values of my colleague who proposed this. i do not think it achieves the end that we want to see by disempowering people to try to help families like mine. i was a child in dc moving to new jersey and found justice--found a pathway toward integration. indeed, i doubt i would be here right now if it weren't for the laws of our land. i hope we can defeat this amendment and ensure that our nation becomes more fair and more just and that more families like mine can find the america we hail when we pledge allegiance to the flag and say we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum calls be charged equally, fairly--like fair housing--fairly, to both sides. the presiding officer (mr. rounds). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. booker. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. recognition of the majority leader the presiding officer. the majority leader is recognized. the appropriations process mr. mcconnell. mr. president, senators have been working diligently this week, continuing our efforts to advance american priorities and responsibly fund important programs through the appropriations process. we have made good progress so far. the senate already passed one funding bill by a broad majority at a record early time. another appropriations subcommittee approved its own funding bill just the other day, and it is my hope that we will be able to move two more funding measures across the finish line very shortly. with continued work and cooperation, we can do just that. the two measures before us are the result of hard work, negotiation, and compromise. they are the product of strong leadership by senators collins and kirk, and they are the culmination of a good deal of input from both sides of the aisle. here is what we know these bills can achieve: the transportation and housing infrastructure appropriations bill will invest in our transportation systems and help ensure safety and efficiency. the veterans and military construction funding bill will help improve care for veterans and increase oversight and accountability efforts at the va. the legislation before us will also include a provision to help address zika. this compromise provision will focus on immediate needs while also providing resources for longer term goals such as a vaccine. it is another reminder that keeping americans safe and healthy is a top priority for us all. let's continue our work today to move these important funding measures closer to passage. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mrs. murray. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 3897 mrs. murray. mr. president, a home is more than just a roof over someone's head; it is actually where a family builds their lives. in our country, we need to do everything we can to make sure families have options when it comes to finding a place to live, and they need access to affordable, safe, and fair housing. unfortunately, today republicans want to deal a significant blow to fair housing. the amendment they are offering would tear down the civil rights protections in the fair housing act of 1968, and i am here today to strongly urge my colleagues to vote against it. before the civil rights movement, african americans faced an enormous amount of injustice and racism in housing. people of color were often relegated to substandard housing. they were denied mortgages, and rent in an [[page s3006]] african-american neighborhood was often higher than rent in a white neighborhood. when the fair housing act went into effect in 1968, it not only banned discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing, it went a step further: a new federal housing agency was charged with proactively rooting out discrimination and segregation in communities across the country. that is an important part of the law because today people across the country still face systemic and sometimes racially motivated barriers to housing. people with disabilities, people of color, families with children, and religious groups in many areas have limited housing choices. last year the department of housing and urban development, also known as hud, issued a long-overdue rule to help carry out that mission to proactively eliminate housing segregation and discrimination. for states and local governments that get hud investments, this rule would improve the quality and access to data on demographics, it would help researchers analyze the barriers people face to access fair housing, and it would help set priorities and goals for carrying out the mission to actively fight back against discrimination and segregation. based on pilot programs from around the country, we know this rule can help expand opportunity to more americans. one of those pilots was in seattle in my home state of washington. after an assessment of high- poverty areas in puget sound, the city saw that neighborhoods that historically have been disenfranchised lacked job opportunities. armed with that data, the city is setting up a food distribution center and a job incubator in those neighborhoods. the city's work is helping to foster job growth in places where low-income residents live, and through that work, the city expanded economic security to more people. that would not have been possible without the data this long-overdue rule provided us. this is the kind of success this new rule will help further, but unfortunately we are seeing that some republicans want to put a stop to those positive changes and backtrack on the gains we have made on civil rights in housing, and to me, that is unacceptable. here in congress, we should be clearing pathways for more americans to access more housing, not blocking the away. i am here today to urge my colleagues to vote against that amendment, which we will be voting on later. mr. president, while i have the floor, i wish to talk about another topic that is very important to me. i am very honored to come to the floor today with good news for thousands of military families, including three couples i met just last week here in the nation's capital. each of the veterans i met with had suffered a catastrophic injury while fighting for our country, which changed the course of their lives and their families' lives forever. matt keil was shot by a sniper and paralyzed. kevin jaye was injured by a roadside bomb in afghanistan. tyler black was paralyzed during a firefight. what was the one thing each of these veterans wished for after he returned home and got out of the hospital? well, like so many women and men in our country, they dreamed of having a family of their own. even though each veteran suffered injuries that made it nearly impossible to conceive naturally, they have hope because in this day and age, the medical technology exists to make their dream of having a family come true. the most popular path is in vitro fertilization, known as ivf, but because of a policy enacted decades ago, the va is barred from covering the costs of ivf, which forced matt, kevin, and tyler, with their partners, to go down that road alone even though their injuries were caused while serving all of us overseas. collectively, they have paid tens and tens of thousands of dollars out- of-pocket. matt said to me that when he heard the va wouldn't cover the one medical procedure he and his wife wanted so badly, he felt like his country had abandoned him. we are talking about a man who sacrificed his body for our country. i believe this is wrong. when this country sends brave men and women to work, we promise to take care of them when they return home. that is why i have been fighting to change this policy once and for all, and today i am very proud to see this effort take a big step forward with bipartisan support here in the senate. my provision in the underlying va appropriations bill will finally allow the va to cover those costs and let our veterans know their country is there for them when they come home. it is the right thing to do for matt and his wife tracy, kevin and lauren, tyler and crystal, and every other military family in this country. as we move to pass this bill through the senate, i call on my colleagues in the house to follow suit and get this done. this is not about politics or partisanship, and we shouldn't be cutting corners when it comes to our veterans and their families. this is a chance to support our veterans and the dreams they have fought so hard for--to have a family. i thank the presiding officer, and i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. lee. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 3900, as modified mr. lee. mr. president, i call for regular order with respect to the blunt amendment no. 3900. the presiding officer. the amendment is now pending. mr. lee. thank you, mr. president. i rise not to debate the broad question of the federal government's proper role in protecting and advancing public health; instead, i am here to stress to my colleagues that with a growing national debt that will soon exceed $20 trillion, we cannot continue spending money we don't have. if this emergency supplemental measure is adopted, it will be the 15th emergency supplemental we have passed since 2006, totaling about $190 billion in deficit spending. this is not how responsible governments budget. it is not how responsible governments behave. indeed, we have the ability to provide the resources the country needs to fight the zika virus without adding to our national debt. for starters, we can undo the $500 million president obama took from the international infectious diseases account which was placed in his unapproved green climate fund. usaid is sitting on $1.2 billion in unobligated ebola funds. the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response currently has $347 million not being put to use. there is $525 million in cdc's global health security agenda that is unspoken for. to the extent that the zika virus is truly an emergency, one that deserves the federal government's attention, we already have more than enough unused emergency funds to pay for the fight against this emerging threat. yesterday, my colleague, the distinguished junior senator from oklahoma, mr. lankford, illustrated that this administration has tens of billions of dollars in unobligated discretionary funds to pay for this as well. what we should not do, however, is allow the zika virus to be yet another excuse to run up the national debt, just so appropriators can come back and use unspent emergency money on nonemergency parochial priorities at some later date. the entire emergency spending label is to some, perhaps, a little bit misleading. it does not mean that the money gets spent any faster. all it does is give congress the ability to spend the money without having to pay for it, to spend the money without having to offset it somewhere else. that is not how we should operate. i urge my colleagues to uphold this budget point of order. mr. president, pursuant to section 314(e) of the congressional budget act of 1974, i raise a point of order against all of the emergency designations contained in amendment no. 3900, a list of which i am sending to the desk. the presiding officer. the senator from maine. ms. collins. mr. president, i certainly share the deep concern expressed by my colleague from utah over the growing size of the federal debt. it is a serious problem. i encourage him to look at the chart that senator alexander has produced, which shows where the problem is. [[page s3007]] the problem is on the mandatory side of the budget, not the discretionary side of the budget, which, due to efforts we have made, has been held relatively flat for several years. but the mandatory spending side of the budget is soaring. there is no doubt about that. for example, many of us, when the administration presented its budget, rejected the gimmicks that were included, for example, in the transportation budget to shift some $7 billion from discretionary to mandatory spending. that was unwarranted. we did not do that. but if ever there were an emergency, it is the threat posed to public health by the zika virus. about 2 weeks ago, senator johnny isakson and i went to the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta, ga, and heard briefings from the top experts in the world about the threat posed by the zika virus. the fact is that the news keeps getting worse and worse. zika has now been linked for certain to a severe kind of birth defect, making pregnant women particularly at risk. it has also been linked to a disease known as guillain-barre syndrome, which can cause paralysis and even death. those of us who live in northern states--this kind of mosquito, for example, is found only in the very southern tip of maine--should take no comfort from that fact. the cdc has documented cases of the zika virus in virtually every state in the union, and that is because disease knows no boundaries in this world of international travel. in addition, the cdc has documented approximately 1,000 cases of zika. it is an epidemic in puerto rico, where there are more than 475 documented cases--a true crisis for that u.s. territory. from my perspective, we have to act. we have to act quickly. the blunt-murray compromise bill deserves the emergency designation which is attached to it. mr. president, pursuant to section 904 of the congressional budget act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget regulations, i move to waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the blunt-murray amendment no. 3900, and i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer (mr. rubio). is there a sufficient second? there appears to be a sufficient second. the yeas and nays were ordered. ms. collins. mr. president, i believe we are going to have that vote a little bit later. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from georgia. amendment no. 4039 mr. isakson. mr. president, last night i was off the floor when senator mccain of arizona offered an amendment regarding the veterans choice bill. before the decision is made, i wish to memorialize my support for the mccain amendment. as chairman of the veterans' affairs committee, we waived jurisdiction so it could be offered on the va component of this bill. i wish to add one further comment. the cost associated with extending the eligibility of veterans choice by 3 years, which is the mccain amendment, scores at a cost. but to recognize that cost, you have to assume we would not have treated an eligible veteran under any other program if choice expired. we are never going to abandon our veterans. we have a commitment to the veterans for the health care they have signed up for. what senator mccain is doing is trying to improve access to health care and to maintain access through the choice of a private sector provider or through a va provider. there is no additional cost, unless you assume that you want to take away a benefit that we gave 2 years ago in the omnibus that we passed. i commend senator mccain for extending the eligibility for choice for 3 more years. i will support the amendment when it comes before the senate, and i encourage all other members to do the same. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. ms. collins. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ms. collins. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote in relation to h.r. 2577. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 3900, as modified under the previous order, all postcloture time has expired. the question occurs on agreeing to the motion to waive. the yeas and nays have been ordered. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk called the roll. mr. cornyn. the following senator is necessarily absent: the senator from texas (mr. cruz). mr. durbin. i announce that the senator from vermont (mr. sanders) is necessarily absent. the presiding officer. are there any other senators in the chamber desiring to vote?

[[page s3008]] i want to commend chairman blunt for his work with us on this and all the democrats and republicans who are supporting it. but i want to remind all of us, this is only a first step, and we have to make sure that this agreement gets through the house and to the president's desk in the least amount of time. i hope we can separate it from this bill and move it quickly. that was objected to yesterday over pay-fors, which are not part of this amendment, but this is a critical emergency. we need to move on this first step, and i hope we can do it in a timely manner. i yield the floor.

amendment no. 4039 mr. enzi. mr. president, i thank senator mccain for his tremendous effort on behalf of veterans and the different approaches he has used. i don't think anybody has worked harder on it or understands it better. i wish there were more we could do for veterans and will work with him to see that that happens, but this amendment isn't the right place to do it. this amendment proposes that we increase overspending by $7.7 billion for a continuation of the veterans choice program. it doesn't offer badly needed reforms to the program, it simply provides more funding. unfortunately, the accountability measures currently in place at the va do not go far enough in ensuring that the health care needs of our veterans are the priority. by extending the choice program, we would be extending problematic waiting periods, we would be extending a backlog of health care claims, and we would be giving little or no authority to the va to manage its employees. we have been getting complaints about many of these things, and another veterans proposal in the senate improves both health care access for veterans and expanded disciplinary [[page s3009]] measures at the va. senator mccain has worked on that as well. at the same time, it provides offsets to ensure that we continue to help our veterans in the future. i have been concerned about what i thought was $6 billion of emergency expense every year. i had them actually total that up in the committee and found out that we do $26.1 billion a year in emergency spending. we are going to have to find that money somewhere because if we don't provide offsets, we will not be able to help our veterans or our military or our education or anything else. continued spending without making responsible choices for priorities will put us in a real hole. in order to make sure we are spending on our priorities, such as national defense and our veterans, and that they are not crowded out, i raise a point of order. mr. president, pursuant to section 314(e) of the congressional budget act of 1974, i raise a point of order against the emergency designation found on page 3, lines 7 through 12, of amendment no. 4039 to h.r. 2577, the transportation, housing and urban development, and related agencies appropriations act. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from arizona. mr. mccain. mr. president, i note with some interest that the senator from wyoming did not have the same zeal for the $1.1 billion that we just passed in emergency spending for zika that is not paid for, but the important issue is, that this is a program for 1.4 million appointments for veterans who would otherwise wait for delayed care, over 2.5 million separate payments to doctors, 450,000 choice health care providers--the list goes on and on. all i am asking for is an extension of a program that is in effect and helping our veterans. the fact is, the chairman of the veterans' affairs committee said last night: what senator mccain is trying to do to improve access to health care is maintain the access through the choice of a private sector provider or va provider. there is no additional cost unless you assume that you want to take away a benefit that was given 2 years ago in the omnibus bill we passed. he goes on to say he would support this amendment. who is taking advantage? the majority of the people who are taking advantage of this choice card, i will tell the senator from wyoming, are the young men and women who are just returning from iraq and afghanistan. we are giving them a choice. we are giving them a choice to be able to get the care they need and deserve. in my home state of arizona, 50 veterans died while on a nonexistent waiting list--50 of them. that is why we have a choice card, so they can go out and get the care they need and want and not be on a nonexistent waiting list. i don't know what the priorities are of the senator from wyoming, but i can tell him now, they are not mine, and they are not of the men and women who are serving this nation who deserve the best care and the choice of going to the provider that they want to within certain parameters. this is simply an extension of a program that is in existence that cares for our men and women who served our nation with sacrifice, and some of them didn't even come back to have a chance to have a choice card. mr. president, i ask to waive the budget point of order. pursuant to section 904 of the congressional budget act of 1974, and the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, i move to waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable budget resolutions for the purposes of my amendment, and i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second? there appears to be a sufficient second. the question is on agreeing to the motion. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. mr. cornyn. the following senator is

oklahoma. mr. lankford. mr. president, i wish to speak to the issue that was just brought up dealing with veterans funding and specifically the choice program. three years ago, congress put into place a response to what was happening in va centers all over the country. we were all appalled with what was happening at va centers all over the country. but for any of us who are in congressional offices, we were aware, were pushing on this issue, and had pushed on this issue for a while. but the media exposed what we all saw, and that was long-secret waiting lists for veterans so that the va centers could keep their positive numbers up and look better--months of waiting for things that would take days across the street. as i dealt with the va center in my own city, at times it would take 6 months to get a knee replacement surgery at the va center, when at the great hospital directly across the street, they could get that same surgery within 2 days. as to hearing aids, it would take months and months to actually go through the process and to get them at our va centers. as to cancer care, if you were diagnosed with cancer and had needs and treatment that was going to be required, they would literally send you across the country, sometimes more than 2,000 miles away, to actually get cancer treatment--away from your family. congress responded to that by putting into place the choice act. it was an emergency. there were major problems that were happening around the country in multiple va centers, and there had to be a response right then. congress set aside emergency funding and an emergency response to make sure something came into existence that only loosely existed before. what was called community care was now clarified to say that this is choice, and it was simple. if a veteran had to wait [[page s3010]] more than 30 days to get into an appointment or get treatment or if they lived more than 40 miles from a va center, they would be given the option to go wherever they wanted to go. va was required to start working relationships in every community across the country so that veterans would have the option to go wherever they wanted to go. i would acknowledge that program is in its infancy. it is 2 years old at this point. it has a ways to go to be perfected. there are still problems with it, and there is a constant push from congress to provide accountability to make sure that program is done and done well. that should be the first step in giving veterans real choice. the first step of that is 30 days or 40 miles. the second step of that is any va- eligible veteran would get a card and they could go to anyplace that accepts medicare. if they accept medicare anywhere in the country--any lab, any hospital, any doctor--they should also be able to receive veterans as well. so veterans can go wherever they choose to go regardless of the distance. i have veterans who drive past six great hospitals, drive 200 miles to get to a va center, and their families have the burden of all of that travel. it should not be that way. veterans should be able to go wherever they choose to go for care. so the choice program is not only a good program, it is the right direction to go and it is a positive first step. but here is the problem: the way this particular amendment has come up, it is not only not germane to this bill because it deals with something that started 3 years ago and we are dealing with a new bill right now, but it is also an issue of, we are doing the right thing the wrong way. my staff has heard me say this over and over again: there is a right thing to do and there is a right way to do it. three years ago, we knew this was an issue. three years ago, the planning should have been put in place to put this into the normal appropriations process. this process puts it into place, so we are adding $7.5 billion onto our children for a program that should be in the normal appropriations process that was started 3 years ago and that is not an emergency anymore. this is not an emergency. this is now normal funding of a program we want to keep going and expand. so there is a big issue here we do have to resolve. i want to see us do the choice program and do it right, but there is a right thing to do and a right way to do it. this program is already fully funded through the next year. it is not an emergency. it is in place, funded, and ready to go. it doesn't go away in the next year, all the way through the fiscal year. let's put it in the normal process, let's do it the right way, and let's not add $7 billion to our children for an emergency that is actually a year away. no one is going to convince me that in a $4 trillion budget, there are not areas we could cut. earlier this week i identified $86 billion in funds that are available to cover the $1 billion for zika that this congress decided to do in emergency funding anyway. we have the funds available. we can honor our veterans. we can do this and also honor our children. at the same time we are honoring our veterans, let's honor the next generation and make sure we are not adding debt to the next generation. with that, mr. president, i raise a point of order that the mccain amendment no. 4039 is not germane to the collins amendment no. 3896, as amended, or h.r. 2577. the presiding officer. the point of order is sustained, and the amendment falls. mr. lankford. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. kirk. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. kirk. mr. president, i urge my colleagues to support my va spending bill to final passage. it is a very bipartisan bill. i also would like to thank my ranking democratic member, senator jon tester of montana, who has been a great partner. we have worked with all senators on both sides of the aisle to include their priorities and have worked through dozens of amendments. we include more than two dozen amendments in this bill. the bill provides record funding for our veterans' health care, protects whistleblowers, includes opioid safety, and also has the raid act to clean up the va so that cockroaches are not in the va kitchens and dining facilities. this bill also adds 100 staff to the ig's office and combats veteran homelessness. it requires better screening of va doctors so they can't switch from state to state. the bill also increases medical research and adds money for health care for our veterans. i thank the subcommittee staff for doing outstanding work this year, and that includes tina evans, chad schulken, michael bain, robert henke, d'ann lettieri, patrick magnuson, and carlos elias. the bottom line: this bill does right by our troops and does right by our veterans. i thank my senate colleagues and urge its rapid adoption. ms. mikulski. mr. president, i wish to voice my full support for the fiscal year 2017 transportation, and housing and urban development, and related agencies appropriations bill which includes the fiscal year 2017 military construction, veterans affairs, and related agencies appropriations bill. each of these bills was passed out of the senate appropriations committee by a vote of 30-0 last month. i urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan package of bills. i commend senators collins and reed for their hard work on the t-hud bill and their collegiality on the floor this week managing this bill. t-hud is our annual jobs bill making investments at the state and local level, delivering on america's physical infrastructure needs and america's compelling human needs. the bill before us will keep our roads and transportation systems safe and in good repair while preserving housing assistance for our nation's most in need. i am especially proud of senators collins and reed for making renewed investments in lead paint poison prevention. as the maryland senator from baltimore, this is an issue i know all too well. senator kit bond and i worked together on the va-hud bill to first bring attention to this crippling public health problem. april 19 marked the anniversary of freddie gray's death, a young man who grew up in baltimore's low- income housing. before freddie's second birthday, his blood lead levels were seven times the centers for disease control and prevention's suggested level, leaving freddie severely and permanently brain damaged. today there are still half a million children under the age of 6 with lead poisoning. this bill increases lead prevention funding in three programs. first, the office of lead hazard control and healthy homes is funded at $135 million, an increase of $25 million to support lead-based paint hazard reductions in 1,750 additional units. this program provides safer homes for more than 6,200 people. second, the mikulski-bond lead hazard reduction demo program is funded at $55 million, an increase of $10 million. this program provides competitive funds to state and local governments to implement lead hazardous reduction programs in privately owned and owner-occupied housing. third, the public housing capital fund is funded at $1.9 billion, an increase of $25 million. this will remediate 1,500 public housing units. this bill also includes a number of reforms to hud's lead programs. among these is the requirement for hud to update its blood level standard to the stronger centers for disease control and prevention standard. hud's standard hasn't been updated since 1999. in addition, the bill makes studio and efficiency apartments eligible for remediation grants for the first time. it is estimated that 34,000 zero-bedroom dwellings house children under 6 years old. the transportation portion of this bill makes significant investments in maryland's highways, byways, and transit systems. it cuts the first check under the fast act passed last december. this means more formula funding for every state. for maryland, that is an increase of $62 million. for transit, this bill provides increased funding for the federal transit [[page s3011]] administration totaling $575 million. it includes the job corridor- purple line project in the washington suburbs of maryland. a total of $125 million is provided for the construction of this light rail project. for the dc metro system, this bill provides the eighth installment of $150 million in federal dedicated funding. this is the fully authorized level and will be matched dollar for dollar by the three jurisdictions. fighting for this annual appropriation was the promise i made and have kept since the deadly fort totten crash in june 2009. this funding must be used on capital improvements relating to safety including buying new rail cars, track improvements, and signal upgrades. i included bill language requiring the u.s. department of transportation secretary to do three things before this funding money can be spent. first, the secretary must approve each expenditure. second, the secretary must certify metro is making progress implementing fta's safety and financial management corrective actions. third, the secretary must determine that metro is using this money for top safety priorities. in addition to this dedicated funding, i am proud of the safety amendment i introduced with senators shelby, cardin, warner, kaine, and brown that was passed earlier in the week. this amendment provides additional funding to fta to expand its safety oversight workforce for a total increase of $5.25 million over the current year funding level. it will enable fta to hire six full-time employees for metro's rail operations control center, four more investigators, seven additional inspectors, and six more contractors. this additional funding means fta will now have more inspectors to watch as metro crews work to complete safetrack, the yearlong plan to accelerate repairs on the system. inspectors will be there to make sure the track work is fixed the right way for good. fta also will have safety staff at the rail operations control center 24 hours a day and 7 days a week making sure emergency procedures are followed to prevent future incidents. fta staff will help metro implement the national transportation safety board's recent recommendations to overhaul the center's emergency operations and training. fta staff will make sure these reforms remain in place and are followed. finally, more investigators will help fta tackle approximately 100 metro investigations conducted each year. i also want to say a few words about the military construction and veterans affairs appropriations bill. this is another bipartisan bill funding vital programs for the health and well-being of our nation's veterans, troops, and their families developed by senators kirk and tester. overall, this bill provides $83 billion in discretionary funding which is an increase of $3.2 billion above the current year funding level. this bill fully funds va medical services at the president's request of $52.8 billion. this is $1 billion over what we advanced last year to address increased demand for va medical care both within and outside the va health care system. the bill provides additional funding for disability claims processing. significant progress has been made to eliminate the backlog in processing initial claims, but unfortunately, the backlog in appeals is rapidly building. this bill includes $2.9 billion for claims processing, $30 million above the request, to hire 300 new claims processors and 240 additional employees for the board of veterans appeals. also included is an increase of $46 million for the board of veterans appeals, bringing their total funding to $156 million. this will provide for hiring an additional 240 new employees focused on appeals processing. for our women veterans, this bill makes significant strides bring parity between male and female veterans. this bill mandates that the va research and acquire prosthetic devices specifically designed for women. it includes $5.3 billion overall to treat more than 500,000 female veterans who get care through the va. this bill targets $535 million for gender-specific health care which is $20 million over the request and nearly $70 million over the current funding level. this includes gynecology, reproductive health, and mental health care for women. i also was proud to support senator murray's amendment in committee, allowing the va to cover the cost of reproductive services for veterans who suffered service-related injuries that prevent them from starting families. the military construction part of this bill fully funds all seven maryland projects included in the president's budget request. this means a total of $340 million for construction jobs at fort meade, pax river, joint base andrews, and bethesda medical center. finally, the bill includes $1.1 billion in emergency spending to combat the urgent zika crisis. cdc, nih, and usaid need this funding on the ground today. $1.1 billion is a bottom line, not a starting point for negotiation. i am committed to sending a zika supplemental to the president as soon as possible. i urge all of my colleagues to support this package of bills. it meets many compelling human needs and physical infrastructure needs of our nation and does not include poison pill riders. it is an example of how, working together, we can solve problems and put america to work. ms. collins. mr. president. i rise to speak in support of the military construction and veterans affairs division of the substitute before us. i commend chairman kirk and ranking member tester for their leadership in crafting the fiscal year 2017 military construction and veterans affairs funding bill. as a member of the military construction and veterans affairs subcommittee, i have appreciated their steady, strong advocacy for our nation's veterans, servicemembers, and their families. as the daughter of a world war ii veteran, i know well the sacrifices of those who serve and have served on our behalf, as well as the sacrifices made by their families. the vital programs and benefits funded by this bill will help fulfill our obligations to them and honor their commitment to our nation. while we can never fully repay these debts, we must strive to provide each veteran with the quality health care that they deserve. one way this bill helps to meet this goal is through the extension it would provide of the highly successful access received closer to home, or arch, program. this pilot program, which is scheduled to expire in august, serves rural veterans in northern maine, montana, kansas, virginia, and arizona, providing them access to high quality care in their communities and near their families. many of my constituents tell me that this program has proven to be a lifeline for them and has saved them the arduous burden of traveling up to 600 miles round trip to receive care at the togus va medical center in augusta, me. in maine, the program not only reduces wait times for appointments and prevents veterans from going through a third-party administrator to receive care, but it is cost effective. according to the va's own statistics, the average cost of arch per veteran in maine is less than half the average cost for vha direct care. more than 90 percent of arch veterans are overwhelmingly satisfied with their care, a testament to why arch should be a model for the nation. ensuring that veterans continue to receive this seamless care is paramount, and i thank chairman kirk and ranking member tester for including an extension of this vital program in the fiscal year 2017 funding legislation. i am also pleased that this legislation would fund the president's fiscal year 2017 request for va medical leases, including funding to lease a new community based outpatient clinic--cboc--facility in portland, me. this project would allow va to consolidate and colocate the saco and portland cbocs with maine medical center and its affiliate, the tufts university school of medicine. this collaboration will provide primary care, mental health, women's health, and specialty care medical services for veterans. this legislation would also help to address the opioid epidemic by requiring the department to improve appropriate pain care for veterans. it also includes programs to help end veteran homelessness, expand care services focused on our growing population of female veterans, and support caregivers, who shoulder the enormous responsibility of caring for veterans who are unable to care for themselves [[page s3012]] finally, i want to highlight the funding included in this legislation for our nation's civilian and military members--and their families--who serve at the portsmouth naval shipyard in kittery, me. the legislation includes $74.9 million for housing, the replacement of the medical and dental clinic, and utility nuclear improvements. these projects will help provide the exceptional personnel at pnsy with the facilities they need and deserve to carry out the mission. again, i thank the chairman and ranking member for their excellent work in balancing the priorities within their bill, and i urge my colleagues to advance this important legislation. mr. tester. mr. president, universal, safe, and consistent trucking regulations are vital to all aspects of the trucking industry and to all users of the national highway system. ensuring highway safety must remain a priority of this body. it also remains critical that this body maintain predictable safety laws to sustain efficient outcomes for truckers, trucking companies, the manufacturers and growers of the goods that trucks transport, and the customers who buy the products. congress determined years ago that a uniform system of federal trucking rules would lead to safer and more productive outcomes than a 50-state patchwork of trucking regulations, as goods are often transported across state lines. despite congress's intentions, we are seeing various state trucking rules being implemented across the country that stray from the federal guidelines. we need to figure out how to address this. we need to make sure that we have commonsense rules that don't change every time a driver crosses a state line while continuing to protect truck drivers and road users from unsafe situations. i think we have got a little more work to do before we are ready for a solution, but i pledge to work with all who are willing and maybe we can figure something out in the coming months. thank you. maritime security program mr. wicker. mr. president, i join today with my good friend, senator hirono, to address the requirement for full authorized funding of the maritime security program. senator hirono and i serve together on the seapower subcommittee and firmly believe that this program is important to our national security. the united states needs a u.s.-flag merchant marine that is strong, active, competitive, and useful to the military. our merchant marine has a long history of providing sealift support to our armed forces for global military operations. the maritime security program is a unique public-private partnership that helps the merchant marine, enhancing america's commercial sealift capability while saving the american taxpayer billions of dollars. ms. hirono. mr. president, as ranking member of the seapower subcommittee, i could not agree more with the senator from mississippi's views concerning the importance of the msp program. the 60-ship msp program is the most prudent and economical means to address the u.s. military's current and projected sealift requirements. a 2006 report prepared for the military sealift committee of the national defense transportation association concluded that ``the likely cost to the government to replicate just the vessel capacity provided by the msp dry cargo vessels would be $13 billion.'' in addition, the u.s. transportation command, transcom, has estimated that it would cost the u.s. government an additional $52 billion to replicate the ``global intermodal system'' that is made available to the department of defense, dod, by msp participants. in contrast, msp participants now provide dod with the same vessels and global intermodal system at a fraction of what it would cost our government to do the job itself. mr. wicker. the senate version of the transportation-hud appropriations bill for fiscal year 2017 includes $275 million for the maritime security program. this is an increase of $65 million above the enacted level for fiscal year 2016. although we are pleased that the senate appropriations committee has recommended this increase in funding, we hasten to point out that congress acted last december to increase the authorization level for the maritime security program to $299,997,000 for fiscal year 2017. the house appropriations committee has recommended funding for the next fiscal year that would meet this authorization. as this appropriations bill works its way through congress, we urge the chairs and ranking members of the transportation-hud appropriations subcommittees and the full appropriations committee to work in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to provide funding for the maritime security program at its fully authorized level of $299,997,000 for fiscal year 2017. ms. hirono. i strongly agree with senator wicker. despite the clear benefits the msp program provides, the msp commercial fleet is under extreme economic pressure from reductions in government-impelled cargoes and foreign competitive factors. i completely share the concerns expressed by the then-transcom commander, gen paul selva, in his march 2015 testimony before the armed services committee, where he stated that the ``reduction in government impelled cargoes due to the drawdown in afghanistan and reductions in food aid . . .are driving vessel owners to reflag to non-u.s.-flag out of economic necessity . . .with the recent vessel reductions, the mariner base is at the point where future reductions in u.s.-flag capacity puts our ability to fully activate, deploy and sustain forces at increased risk.'' accordingly, to ensure that this essential u.s. commercial sealift capability provided by the msp program remains available to meet america's national security requirements, the msp program needs to be fully funded as authorized by the congress. mr. wicker. i would like to add a comment from the current transcom commander, gen darren mcdew. in january, general mcdew said, ``as a military professional and senior leader, i think about and plan for what the future may hold, and i would tell you we must prepare for the real possibility we will not enjoy the uncontested seas and broad international support experienced in 1991. if either of those possibilities becomes reality, and if we remain committed to responding to security incidents around the globe, the only way of guaranteeing we decisively meet our national objectives is with u.s. ships operated by u.s. mariners.'' i thank senator hirono for joining me in this effort to ensure that full funding is secured for the maritime security program in fiscal year 2017. mr. kirk. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. sasse). the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. peters. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. u.s. innovation and competitiveness mr. peters. mr. president, i rise today to discuss the need to drive innovation and competitiveness here in the united states. i vividly remember watching the apollo missions on tv and the launch of that 36-story tall saturn v rocket that took neil armstrong and buzz aldrin to the surface of the moon. the space program not only inspired a generation of americans, but it also led to incredible advances in science and technology that over the last 50 years have accounted for as much as half of all the economic growth in the united states. these groundbreaking advances firmly established our nation as an international leader in innovation. during the height of the space race, america's federal investment in research and development reached nearly 2 percent of the nation's gdp. today, overall federal r&d spending--the seed corn of our future prosperity--has fallen to a historic low of 0.78 percent of gdp. with the united states investing less on science, research, and education, and our competitors outpacing us, we are losing our footing in the global marketplace. congress must increase the federal investment in r&d to 1 percent of gdp if we want to continue to be leading the world in innovation. this commitment should include a focus on increased federal support for basic research--an essential component of any kind of innovation economy. [[page s3013]] in addition to increased investment, we in congress need to implement policy solutions that will reassert american leadership internationally. we need to invest in what works. we need to listen to the innovators, academic leaders, and industries that are making the life-changing inventions of the future a reality. to that end, my colleague senator cory gardner and i have convened a series of roundtable discussions on ways to improve the american innovation system. just last week, our commerce committee leaders, chairman thune and ranking member nelson, held a productive hearing on ways to leverage the u.s. science and technology enterprise. after receiving input from industry, academia, science organizations, and economic development organizations, senators thune, nelson, gardner, and i are working to develop new legislation to guide our nation's research priorities in the coming years and to improve america's innovation system. through these roundtables, we heard that the stakeholder community agrees that modest, sustained, and predictable increases in federal research and development investments are absolutely critical to ensuring the economic competitiveness of the united states. we need continued federal investment in basic research, while also providing opportunities to commercialize that research. there is basic research that our companies simply cannot afford to conduct, making federal investment absolutely critical. we also need to work to reduce administrative burdens on researchers so that we can maximize our federal research investment. we need that investment to be put into the lab and not filling out more paperwork. we need stronger partnerships between government, the private sector, and academia in order to capitalize on discoveries emerging from our world-class research universities, such as the university of michigan, wayne state university, and michigan state university. we must also close the significant employment gap in the stem workforce for women and underrepresented minorities. women make up less than 50 percent of post-bachelor stem degree programs and only about one-quarter of the stem workforce. underrepresented minorities, including hispanics and african americans, make up about 10 percent of the science and engineering workforce. last month, i joined a number of my colleagues in introducing the stem opportunities act, legislation that would improve inclusion of women, minorities, and people with disabilities in stem careers. it is a top priority for me to see that a similar provision is included in our bipartisan legislation. finally, if we want to continue to be a leader in the global economy, we need to be a nation that makes things. michigan is a state that builds and grows things, and i will continue to fight to make sure we continue doing that. investments in advanced manufacturing will support firms of all sizes and support good-paying jobs and help keep them here in the united states. that is why it is one of my top priorities for this legislation that we ensure american manufacturing companies can compete and succeed in the highly competitive global marketplace. last month, i joined my colleagues, senators coons and ayotte, to introduce the bipartisan manufacturing extension partnership improvement act. the manufacturing extension program, or mep, is a federal public-private partnership that helps businesses get their products to market through a variety of consulting services. the mep improvement act would expand and improve the mep program to serve small- and medium-sized manufacturing companies, which are a critical part of our economy and our national competitiveness. including key components of the mep improvement act will be a top priority for me in the new legislation being drafted. science and technology are inseparable from the american competitiveness ecosystem. however, we need to focus on the entire ecosystem--from stem, or steam, to basic research, to application and commercialization--and the inspiration that drives ambitious endeavors like exploring space and the other frontiers of science. we in congress must do our part by supporting and investing in our efforts to drive economic growth, unleash increased productivity, enhance our safety and security, and make the world a better place for future generations. we are facing big challenges as a nation, but i am committed to working with everyone--democrats, republicans, industry, academia, workers, students, and employers--to increase investments and implement the solutions that will ensure american competitiveness and create more good-paying jobs here in the united states. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. durbin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. durbin. mr. president, if there is one specialty that every member of congress has, it is air travel. we spend more time on airplanes, more time in airports, more time waiting for flights and worrying about flights than most other americans. as members of congress, we are veterans of air travel. we have all seen the footage of people waiting to go through security screening at major airports, particularly in the city of chicago at both o'hare and midway. the lines are so long that people have had to wait 2 to 3 hours--2 to 3 hours to go through a security checkpoint. people are angry, and i don't blame them. thousands of people have missed their flights, and some were stuck sleeping in airports overnight. the commissioner of aviation, ginger evans, told me: we pulled out the cots that we save for snow emergencies so that people now, in the heat of early summer, are facing the same kinds of delays. our highest priority is to protect those who travel on our airplanes. poor planning and inadequate funding have led to alarming delays across airports in america, and in chicago we have felt it more than most. more needs to be done to fix the problem. that is what i have been working to do. earlier this week, i talked to the department of homeland security secretary jeh johnson on the phone about the next steps. yesterday, i followed up with a call to tsa administrator peter neffenger to hear his thoughts. we all agree that the real problem is the shortage of tsa screeners. more people need to be hired and trained so security lines can stay open and people can move through the checkpoints faster. in the meantime, there are immediate steps we need to take in chicago. first, we are going to get 58 more tsa screening officers in the next 2 weeks and 224 by august. that is about a 15-percent increase in tsa staff, and it is a good start. o'hare will also receive 5 k-9 teams. that will double the number of k-9s we have at the airport. two teams were brought in yesterday, and the rest will arrive within 5 days. these bomb-sniffing dogs do important work. they check carry-on baggage. if there is no problem, the passengers can move out of the standard line and into the expedited line. these dogs can help us speed up the process by allowing up to 5,000 additional passengers a day to move through the faster security lines. there will also be a shift of 100 tsa staff from part-time to full- time status so more people can be on deck to help with the lines. and officers who currently work on nondirect security functions are going to be called to pitch in and help officers at the checkpoints. we are also working to get more people enrolled in tsa precheck. i can't emphasize enough how important that is. for $85, a regular traveler can buy--or at least apply for and be given--a tsa precheck status for 5 years. precheck lines can scan nearly twice as fast as the ordinary lines. customers don't have to wait as long or remove their shoes, belts, or light jackets. we need to make sure more people are hearing about this option and are signing up for it as quickly as possible. tsa is now working on a mobile app to help people get enrolled while they are waiting in lines, and they are also looking at lowering precheck signup costs by competing out the actual function of signing up for precheck. [[page s3014]] precheck has gotten a lot of traction, especially in chicago, where this past month alone we have seen 5,700 new enrollments. i hope we can continue to quickly expand this program to help more people into the faster lines. the airlines have to be part of the solution as well. i am glad senator blumenthal of connecticut is on the floor because both he and senator markey of massachusetts spoke out early on this aspect that i am about to address. airlines can help us by reducing high wait times, especially during the peak summer season. i have joined my colleagues senator blumenthal and senator markey in urging the airlines to suspend the checked bag fees over the summer. a lot of people are dragging their bags on the airplanes because they don't want to pay to have them checked. on monday, i spoke with secretary johnson, who told me baggage fees are contributing to long lines because more people are carrying on luggage that should be carefully screened through check-in. over the last year, the volume of passengers and personnel passing through security checkpoints has increased 7 percent while the number of checked bags has increased only 3 percent. that tells the story: more people are carrying on their luggage and causing problems as more travelers pack their roller bags to the brim, making the bags take even longer to be scanned. waiving the checked baggage fee during the summer travel season can reduce the incentive for passengers to carry-on luggage, and it can help speed up the process. let me also add that it is in this baggage that people are dragging onboard that tsa screeners are finding things that aren't supposed to be on an airplane. last year, they found 2,653 firearms, and 83 percent of them were loaded. most of them were from one state; i will not name it. but by and large, we have to be more mindful of the fact that this stops the process or at least slows it down. i am convening a meeting with administrator neffenger tomorrow, along with state and local officials and airlines at chicago o'hare, and then we are also going to be visiting the midway airport. we will see firsthand what airlines are experiencing and what their response is. we have to stop this meltdown when it comes to airport security. let me close by saying this: the news today about egyptair was a grim reminder that we still live in a very dangerous world. the role and responsibility of the transportation security agency is to make sure that when we and our families travel, we come off those planes just as safely as we went on. it is an important security responsibility. yes, it is an irritation and a frustration, but we need to do it in this dangerous world to make sure that we stop people from using their carry-on baggage and other sources to cause harm to innocent people. i stand behind tsa and its mission, but what happened in chicago is unacceptable. this meltdown should have been avoided. there should have been better management, more screeners, and we should have been ready for the surge in passengers. beginning this week, we are going to make that right. i hope the visit by the tsa administrator tomorrow will be the beginning of a conversation that will not only help our airports in chicago but also help our nation. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from connecticut. mr. blumenthal. mr. president, i thank my colleague and friend from illinois for his leadership on this issue and his support for the initiative that senator markey and i first raised, which he has supported so very helpfully, and essentially that is to persuade the airlines to stop charging for bags that are checked onto planes as opposed to being carried on. obviously, the fee for checking those bags adds to the number of carry-ons and provides an incentive for larger numbers of carry-ons. in fact, tsa itself reports that there has been an increase in carry-ons due to these fees. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that i be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. mr. blumenthal. i thank the presiding officer. the elimination of the fees for checked bags is not a panacea. it is not going to solve this problem alone. but it will, along with other measures, help reduce lines that result from screening. i commend admiral neffenger for his very close and prompt attention to this matter and for a number of the initiatives he has taken. we heard about them in the commerce committee this morning. i also thank secretary johnson for supporting elimination of the fees for checked bags. i think his leadership will be important. there are a number of other initiatives that can and should be taken. there is automated equipment that can expedite the screening of those carry-on bags. the use of additional screeners is important. the number has been reduced over the last 3 years by about 5,800. the addition of another close to 800 will help compensate. but again, alone, none of these solutions will provide the answer. as far as the automated equipment is concerned, the cost for the 20 busiest airports is about $30 million--a pittance compared to the $3.8 billion in revenue the airlines make every year as a result of the fees for checked baggage. i will repeat that: $3.8 billion is going to airlines as a result of their purposefully charging for bags checked instead of carried on. many of those bags that go through screening now wind up in the holds of those airplanes anyway because there isn't room for them on the plane, so they wind up being checked at the gate. that simply adds to the cost and inconvenience of passengers: delayed flights, missed flights, flights that are in effect late because of the boarding problems. all of these accumulating issues are reasons to eliminate these fees and also give passengers the benefit of lower costs. my hope is that the airlines will voluntarily eliminate these fees for checked bags. after the meeting we had today with admiral neffenger, i am encouraged that the tsa will take initiative and help to implement other measures as well. in the meantime, we need the airlines to show some leadership as well, and i am hopeful they will do the right thing. the u.s. travel association has called it a national crisis. the evidence is irrefutable. at checkpoints that have no fee charges for bags, the carry-ons are 27 percent lower, so the numbers of carry-ons definitely diminish as the fees are eliminated. this evidence is irrefutable and argues powerfully that the airlines should not keep their passengers waiting in line. they should make some sacrifice to their bottom line and should not be profiting at the expense of their passengers. i will conclude by saying on this point--and i am so glad to see my colleague and friend from massachusetts--that we need this initiative now, and we need it to happen. i also want to advocate on behalf of the safety of our roads. blumenthal amendment no. 4002 will not be called up in part because it had been willfully mischaracterized by an industry campaign. in effect, we need to make truck drivers more safely empowered on the roads to take steps to protect themselves. drivers who spend too much time behind the wheel are tired. they can't drive as safely. this amendment would enable them to drive more safely, give them the rest they need, protect them, and enable the roads to be safer not only for them but for people generally. mr. markey. mr. president, will the senator yield? mr. blumenthal. i yield to senator markey. mr. markey. i just want to thank the senator for his work. we have been partnering on this issue of eliminating bag fees at airports. since they have been imposed, 27 percent more bags now go through baggage clearing with passengers. if we could just get that out of the way, get rid of those baggage fees, i think it would expedite dramatically the ability of people to get on planes in this country. so i am glad we are able to have this moment to be able to speak about the importance of this issue. mr. blumenthal. mr. president, as i mentioned earlier, the senator from massachusetts and i have been partners in this effort, and i hope we can prevail. the presiding officer. the senator from maine. [[page s3015]] amendment no. 3970 to amendment no. 3896 ms. collins. mr. president, i call up the collins-reed-cochran amendment no. 3970. the presiding officer. the clerk will report. the legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from maine [ms. collins] proposes an amendment numbered 3970 to amendment no. 3896. ms. collins. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the amendment is as follows: (purpose: to prohibit the use of funds to carry out a final rule and notice of the department of housing and urban development) at the appropriate place in division a, insert the following: sec. __. none of the funds made available by this act may be used by the department of housing and urban development to direct a grantee to undertake specific changes to existing zoning laws as part of carrying out the final rule entitled ``affirmatively furthering fair housing'' (80 fed. reg. 42272 (july 16, 2015)) or the notice entitled ``affirmatively furthering fair housing assessment tool'' (79 fed. reg. 57949 (september 26, 2014)). ms. collins. mr. president, the amendment that senator jack reed, senator thad cochran, and i are offering would make very clear that none of the funds made available in this appropriations bill can be used by the department of housing and urban development to direct a recipient of federal funds to undertake changes to their zoning laws. there has been concern that some have brought up that a new rule that was issued last year by the department would somehow allow hud to be the national zoning authority for every neighborhood in our country. while i do not believe that is a correct interpretation of the fair housing amendment or regulation that hud has promulgated, the collins- reed-cochran amendment ensures that hud cannot do that. it eliminates that possibility and ensures that communities will continue to make their own decisions to address these federal requirements. by contrast, the proposal offered by my colleague from utah, senator lee, would prohibit all funding for a rule that was issued by hud based on a requirement that is included in the landmark civil rights era law known as the fair housing act of 1968. it is important to know that this regulation was in direct response to a 2010 gao report that criticized hud's implementation of the requirement of the law that grantees, recipients of these funds, affirmatively enhance fair housing opportunities. it also was issued in response to requests from communities seeking guidance to ensure compliance because they don't want to be sued for inadvertently violating fair housing act requirements. so communities asked hud for more tools, better assessments, and more guidance to make sure that they were in compliance. it is important to know that the fair housing act prohibits discrimination not only based on race, national origin, and religion but also against those with disabilities. indeed, 56 percent of the complaints of housing discrimination have been initiated by individuals with disabilities. that is why senator lee's amendment is opposed by the paralyzed veterans of america and other disability groups, as well as the urban league, the naacp, and countless civil rights groups. on the first vote, we will be voting on the collins-reed-cochran amendment. ms. murkowski. will senator collins yield briefly for a question? ms. collins. yes, i will yield. ms. murkowski. senator collins and every member of this body know that i support fair housing. it is so important for my state, where there is a lack of affordable housing, and the anchorage school district is one of the most diverse in the nation. however, i have heard concerns from people in alaska. they worry not so much about the rule itself but about how hud could implement it. many communities in alaska are overwhelmingly alaska native, 90 percent or more of the population. will this affirmatively furthering fair housing rule result in federal grants being withheld from communities that are currently and have long been populated almost entirely by alaska natives because those communities are now considered to be segregated? ms. collins. no community in the united states or its insular areas will lose federal housing funds solely because of its racial demographics. there are communities throughout the united states that are racially homogenous for reasons that have nothing to do with discrimination or other historic barriers. the rule does not change the fair housing act, which for decades has included the affirmative fair housing requirement. the whole purpose of the rule is to ensure that states and communities that receive federal funds take this requirement seriously. this rule is a planning tool, created to help grantees identify barriers to fair housing and plan how to address them. the rule does not penalize any community for where it starts but rather assists a community in taking meaningful steps to address any barriers it may find. hud would never deny federal funds to a community simply because of its demographics. it has never done so in the 48 years since the passage of the fair housing act, and it will not under this rule. additionally, i know some have expressed concern about what effect this rule would have on alaskan natives and other native americans. hud's housing programs for native alaskans and other native americana are authorized under the native american housing assistance and self determination act, nahasda. nahasda includes a statutory exemption from the fair housing act, which the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule does not change. the presiding officer. the senator from utah. mr. lee. mr. president, the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule, which my amendment would defund, is equal parts condescension and willful blindness. the condescension of this particular rule and its proponents is that local governments and public housing authorities across america can't figure out how to provide fair and affordable housing to their communities without the help, without the paternalistic interference of federal bureaucrats. this is the epitome of the paternalism that informs so much of what happens in washington, dc, today. i don't doubt, as senator collins has said repeatedly, that local governments would like ``better guidance'' from the department of housing and urban development in washington. but this is a problem that was created by hud, with its onerous requirements and its vague mandates, not the result of local governments being unable or unwilling to provide adequate low-cost housing for their neighbors in need. this brings us to the willful blindness part of the affirmative furthering fair housing rule. proponents of the rule claim that hud officials consulted closely with local governments and public housing authorities when drafting and finalizing the affh rule. in their telling, local housing agencies across the country are welcoming the affh rule with open arms. but this ignores what local officials have actually said about affh. i will let these local officials speak for themselves. roger partridge, the county commissioner of douglas county, co, had this to say, in an email, about affh, the closed process that produced it, and the immense burdens it will place on local governments: douglas county believes that the assessment of fair housing tool as it now stands is an unfunded mandate that will create an administrative nightmare for jurisdictions who want to further fair housing and implement community programs with hud grants. partridge continues: hud headquarters has repeatedly ignored the local practitioners responsible for affh and implementing the afh in our communities. he continues: in fact, hud headquarters staff was in denver for a public affh roundtable on april 21st, during [the afh tool] comment period. they ignored the opportunity to inform region viii fair housing and equal opportunity (fheo) staff or the local practitioners attending the roundtable. no notice from the hud exchange to the grantee list serve was found. the local governments who were asked to comment on the publication were shut out of the process. likewise, this is what we have heard from salt lake county officials: the administrative burden imposed by this tool is excessive. resources that could be put [[page s3016]] into housing related tasks are being funneled into completing the tool and its associated administrative tasks. additionally, although hud claims that this tool can be completed without the use of a consultant, the assessment is complex enough to warrant considering a consultant. the rule imposes a jurisdictional and regional analysis that is too complex to be effectively completed by staff without specific statistical and mapping knowledge. as housing providers, most staff at phas have comparative advantages that lie in providing affordable housing services, but not providing complex statistical data analysis. forcing pha staff to do this analysis is an inefficient use of their scarce time. salt lake county officials added the following: the afh does not recognize the zero-sum nature of a pha's resource allocation. by allocating resources to complete this process, phas are not allocating resources somewhere else. those resources could be used to provide additional housing assistance. instead of ignoring the words and the experiences of our local officials, and instead of condescending to them, we should listen to them and learn from them. we should stop this disastrous new housing rule from causing more problems than it has already caused. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from maine. ms. collins. mr. president, i know the senator from alabama is going to speak, and the senator from rhode island should have an opportunity to speak. so i ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute for each side prior to the votes in this series. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from alabama. mr. shelby. mr. president, i rise today in support of senator lee's amendment that would prevent the implementation of hud's affirmatively furthering fair housing regulation. contrary to statements that have been made, the senator's amendment does nothing to change fair housing laws or to prevent the enforcement thereof. what the lee amendment does is to prevent the implementation of a rule that would give hud federal control over local planning decisions. supporters of this program have argued that it is intended to protect communities from fair housing lawsuits. it is quite the contrary. this rule, if allowed to be implemented, will actually lay the predicate for endless litigation against every community in our respective states that are required to participate. this should be unacceptable to every member of this body. supporting senator lee's amendment is the only option before us to prevent centralized federal control of local planning decisions. in my judgment, the collins-reed amendment does nothing to restrain the full implementation of hud's program. i urge my colleagues to support the lee amendment. the presiding officer. the senator from rhode island. mr. reed. mr. president, the pending amendment is authored by my colleague from maine and myself. the amendment makes very clear that local officials will remain in charge of zoning decisions and will determine how to best meet their obligations under the fair housing act. those obligations are fundamental to our american fabric, our lives, and the aspirations of this country, because they protect americans' housing choices no matter their physical ability, race, family status, or religion. these protections are fundamental to who we are. but without effective information and transparency so that local communities can make wise decisions, these aspirations can never be realized, are seldom realized, or are not realized to the extent that we, as americans, feel that they should be. senator collins and i have worked very hard to develop language that provides local communities with wide flexibility to meet their requirements under the fair housing act. those requirements will still be there regardless of our action today. if the resources made available under the affirmatively furthering fair housing regulations are not provided, however, those communities will still be required to ensure that housing is available within their communities, regardless of race, physical ability, or the other protected classes under the law. the lee amendment would make grantees liable for compliance without providing the data and tools needed to comply. the thrust--the heart and soul--of this hud proposal, based on gao analysis, is to give local communities the tools, so that they can determine the local answer that makes sense. thank you. the presiding officer. under the previous order, there is 4 minutes equally divided on the collins amendment. the senator from maine. ms. collins. mr. president, i will be very brief. let me just reiterate what i have been saying repeatedly. what the amendment senator reed, senator cochran, and i have introduced does is make very clear that hud is prohibited from intervening in local decisions regarding zoning ordinances. that is in direct response to what some people have been claiming, incorrectly in my view; that the rule on affirmatively furthering fair housing would somehow allow hud to be a national zoning commissar. that is not the case, but to make absolutely sure that could never happen, we have teamed up on this amendment to prohibit hud from intervening in local zoning matters. it is very different from the lee amendment, which we will discuss shortly. this is an important clarification that should take away any fear that there is any possibility of hud using funds authorized by this bill to interfere in local zoning decisions. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from utah. mr. lee. mr. president, the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from maine in and of itself is unobjectionable and does no harm, and on that basis i intend to vote for it. unfortunately, it also doesn't do anything. it does nothing to help the many housing agencies that have told the federal government that president obama's affh rule imposes far too many reporting costs and their already stretched staffs are going to suffer as a result. it does nothing to shield local housing authorities from the very many real lawsuits they will face as a result of the data collected from this regulation, and it does nothing to stop hud from blackmailing local housing agencies with community development block grant program funds. at this time, i wish to cede the remainder of my time to my friend, the senior senator from alabama. the presiding officer. the senator from alabama. mr. shelby. mr. president, we should all be aware that the collins- reed amendment provides no protections to local communities on their local planning rules because it merely prohibits an activity that the rule does not contemplate. even the sponsor of this amendment acknowledged earlier today that the amendment prohibited an activity that she believed would not occur. make no mistake that the so-called affirmatively furthering fair housing rule will likely heavily influence local zoning decisions. however, it does so indirectly, not through direct action as in the collins-reed amendment. hud advertises this fact on its own web site, where it details how communities will have to submit for approval an assessment of fair housing and that these communities will ``use the fair housing goals and priorities established in their [assessment] to inform the investments and other decisions made in their local planning processes.'' in other words, hud does not intend to direct any specific zoning requirements. it does, however, intend to significantly influence local zoning decisions by withholding approval of local plans until they meet hud's central planning goals. this amendment is not sufficient on its own. i believe the only way to prevent hud from intruding into local community planning exactly as they openly state they intend to do is to support the lee amendment. i believe the collins-reed amendment is not alternative to senator lee's amendment, it is, at best, complementary to the lee amendment, and that is something we will have to vote on in just a few minutes. i thank the presiding officer. ms. collins. mr. president, i yield back the remainder of time on our side, and i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second?

without objection, it is so ordered. the clerk will report the amendments en bloc by number. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from maine [ms. collins], for others, proposes amendments numbered 4050 and 4026, as modified, en bloc to amendment no. 3896. the amendments are as follows: amendment no. 4050 (purpose: to make temporary relocation assistance available for tenants in project-based section 8 properties with imminent health and safety risks) on page 85, line 6, insert ``provided further, that the secretary may provide section 8 rental assistance from amounts made available under this paragraph for units assisted under a project-based subsidy contract funded under the `project-based rental assistance' heading under this title where the owner has received a notice of default and the units pose an imminent health and safety risk to residents: provided further, that to the extent that the secretary determines that such units are not feasible for continued rental assistance payments or transfer of the subsidy contract associated with such units to another project or projects and owner or owners, any remaining amounts associated with such units under such contract shall be recaptured and used to reimburse amounts used under this paragraph for rental assistance under the preceding proviso:'' before ``provided further,''. amendment no. 4026, as modified (purpose: to prohibit certain health care providers from providing non- department health care services to veterans) at the end of title ii of division b, add the following: sec. 251. prevention of certain health care providers from providing non-department health care services to veterans. (a) in general.--one year after enactment of this act, the secretary of veterans affairs [[page s3018]] shall deny or revoke the eligibility of a health care provider to provide non-department health care services to veterans if the secretary determines that-- (1) the health care provider was removed from employment with the department of veterans affairs due to conduct that violated a policy of the department relating to the delivery of safe and appropriate patient care; (2) the health care provider violated the requirements of a medical license of the health care provider; (3) the health care provider had a department credential revoked and the secretary determines that the grounds for such revocation impacts the ability of the health care provider to deliver safe and appropriate care; or (4) the health care provider violated a law for which a term of imprisonment of more than one year may be imposed. (b) permissive action.--one year after enactment of this act, the secretary may deny, revoke, or suspend the eligibility of a health care provider to provide non- department health care services if the secretary has reasonable belief that such action is necessary to immediately protect the health, safety, or welfare of veterans and-- (1) the health care provider is under investigation by the medical licensing board of a state in which the health care provider is licensed or practices; (2) the health care provider has entered into a settlement agreement for a disciplinary charge relating to the practice of medicine by the health care provider; or (3) the secretary otherwise determines that such action is appropriate under the circumstances. (c) suspension.--the secretary shall suspend the eligibility of a health care provider to provide non- department health care services to veterans if the health care provider is suspended from serving as a health care provider of the department. (d) initial review.--the secretary shall review the department employment status and history of each healthcare provider providing non-department heathcare services to determine instances of circumstances described in paragraphs (a) through (c) and shall take action as appropriate to each circumstance as described in paragraphs (a) through (c). (e) report required.--not later than two years after the date of the enactment of this act, the comptroller general of the united states shall submit to congress a report on the implementation by the secretary of this section, including the following: (1) the aggregate number of health care providers denied or suspended under this section from participation in providing non-department health care services. (2) an evaluation of any impact on access to care for patients or staffing shortages in programs of the department providing non-department health care services. (3) an explanation of the coordination of the department with the medical licensing boards of states in implementing this section, the amount of involvement of such boards in such implementation, and efforts by the department to address any concerns raised by such boards with respect to such implementation. (4) such recommendations as the comptroller general considers appropriate regarding harmonizing eligibility criteria between health care providers of the department and health care providers eligible to provide non-department health care services. (f) non-department health care services defined.--in this section, the term ``non-department health care services'' means-- (1) services provided under subchapter i of chapter 17 of title 38, united

closing remarks, i would yield to senator reed, who has been such an extraordinary partner as we have worked together in a transparent and collaborative way to bring this bill across the finish line. the presiding officer. the senator from rhode island. mr. reed. mr. president, let me return the compliment to the chairman of the committee, senator collins of maine, for her extraordinary insight, leadership, and ability to bring us together. this bill reflects the priorities of members on both sides of the aisle, it reflects sound policy, and it was a pleasure to work with her. i think that she will also commend our extraordinary staffs who provided support, working many times when we were not working to get the job done. i thank dabney hegg, heideh shahmoradi, christina monroe, nathan robinson, jordan stone, jason woolwine, mike clarke, lydia collins, and gus maples. these are professionals who are thoughtful, skillful, pleasant, and probably deserving of the real praise for work done on the floor. let me once again thank senator collins for her thoughtful leadership and her commitment to fairness and principle. i think that she is one of the major reasons we are here today. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from maine. ms. collins. mr. president, the senate has completed its consideration of this appropriations measure, which provides essential funding for the department of transportation, the department of housing and urban development, related agencies, military construction programs, the department of veterans affairs, and to combat zika. i thank all of my colleagues for working together with us in an open and collaborative manner. i would note that the legislation we just passed incorporates some 40 [[page s3019]] amendments. there were also recommendations from more than 75 senators from both sides of the aisle included in the transportation-hud appropriations portion of this bill which were incorporated at the committee level. i thank all of my colleagues for giving us their suggestions, their requests, and their insights. it made for a better bill. as i mentioned, i am particularly grateful to senator jack reed, the ranking member of the transportation-hud subcommittee, for his work. i also thank the staff for their diligence and commitment throughout this process. as senator reed mentioned, we worked extremely hard, but our staff worked even harder. so i thank heideh shahmoradi, rajat mathur, jason woolwine, lydia collins, gus maples, dabney hegg, nathan robinson, christina monroe, jordan stone, and mike clarke on the subcommittee staff. i also give special thanks to the floor and cloakroom staffs who worked so hard. without the help of laura dove and her team and the team on the democratic side, we could not be where we are today. they did a lot of the vetting that needed to be done on various amendments. they helped us in the negotiations and compromises that ultimately were included in this bill. i would note that our transportation-hud portion of this bill recognizes the fiscal reality while making critical investments into our crumbling infrastructure and economic development projects. it meets our responsibility to vulnerable populations. i think most of our colleagues are unaware that 84 percent of hud's budget goes to subsidized housing. when we fund that, we keep very vulnerable low- income families, disabled individuals, and our low-income seniors from being at risk of homelessness. we also paid special attention in this bill to vulnerable homeless populations, such as our veterans and our young people. we continued a program the administration wanted to abolish that helps our homeless veterans, to whom we owe so much--$57 million in new vouchers, so that we can continue the progress we are making in housing our homeless veterans. since we started this program, the number of homeless veterans has declined by about one-third. this program works, but we can't declare victory until the job is done. that is why both last year and this year we funded the program, even though the president's budget sought to eliminate it. we have made real investments in helping some of our most vulnerable young people, and those are youth who have been in the foster care program and then age out of that program. in some cases, they are aging out of the program before they have even graduated from high school, and they have nowhere to go. so through family reunification vouchers and other programs, we are beefing up support so they don't fall through the cracks and become vulnerable to traffickers, to dropping out of school, to couch surfing, or ending up in shelters. in particular, i am very proud of the work we have done in that area. i am very pleased this bill funds the tiger grant program at $525 million. this program has been extraordinarily popular and effective. it has funded projects in each and every state--projects that have led to job creation and economic development. when we think about it, at heart, much in this bill is about creating jobs and security for our fellow citizens. if you don't have a place to live, it is very difficult to show up for work every day. if the infrastructure is crumbling, it is very difficult for a business to hire the employees who produce the products and get those products to market. the construction projects this bill will fund creates good-paying jobs. in many ways, i think of this as a jobs bill. let me give another example of a very popular program, the community development block grant program. if you ask of the mayors and other town and city officials in your state, they will point to that program as one that gives them the flexibility to improve their downtowns, to make investments that bring new employers to the region, to build affordable housing, whatever their needs are, and that is the beauty of that program. it is not dictated from washington. it gives tremendous flexibility to states and communities to design the kinds of economic development programs that boost growth and create jobs. in short, our bill strikes the right balance between thoughtful investment and fiscal restraint and thereby sets the stage for future economic growth, something i know the presiding officer has been a real leader in speaking out about and reminding us that must be our focus as members of the senate. i am also pleased we were able to bring spending bills to the floor for members to examine, debate, and vote on in a transparent manner. the worst situation is when we do a series of continuing resolutions temporarily funding the essential functions of government. they create such uncertainty, they lock in priorities from previous years rather than reflecting today's priorities, and they end up costing more money. agencies are unable to enter into contracts. businesses, because of the uncertainty, tend to build in a little extra into their bids. it is a terrible way to operate. equally bad is the practice of bundling all 12 of the appropriations bills into one gigantic omnibus bill, thousands of pages long, that is rushed through at the end of the fiscal year--or, more often, at the expiration of one of those continuing resolutions that i just deplore. we are not doing that this year. this is the third appropriations bill that the senate has passed earlier than ever, with great cooperation from both sides of the aisle. the members of the appropriations committee and its two leaders, senator cochran and senator mikulski, deserve great credit for putting us on a strict schedule and keeping the process moving. in fact, in the full committee today, we approved two more appropriations bills that are ready to come to the senate floor. that is the way the process used to work. that is the way the process should work, and that is the way the process is working this year. i believe it is a great credit to the senate, to the leaders of the appropriations committee, and to majority leader mcconnell, who has made it a goal that all 12 bills be reported by the appropriations committee and brought to the senate floor, individually or two or three combined, for full and open debate. again, i thank members on both sides of the aisle. many of your requests are included in this important legislation. i feel fortunate to have worked with senator jack reed on this bill. he is not only a great colleague and a terrific senator but also a good friend. ____________________",124260

Madam President, in honor of National Military Appreciation Month, I wish to recognize Bob Newman of Musselshell County, a U.S. Army veteran. After leaving the Army, he went into law enforcement and served his community in the Musselshell County Sheriff's Department. Newman has dedicated his life to serving God, his country, and his community by giving countless hours of his time to military service, as well as helping fellow veterans in a countless number of ways. Since leaving the Army, Newman has participated in hundreds of services aimed towards veterans. Two great examples of his dedication are his work with the Patriot Guard of Montana and with Big Sky Honor Flights. The Patriot Guard of Montana was founded in 2005, and Newman was one of its original members; he now serves as a ride captain. This grassroots organization consists of motorcycle riders who want to show respect for fallen American soldiers by escorting funeral processions for fallen heroes and protecting mourning family and friends from any potential disturbances caused by protestors. Newman also partakes in Big Sky Honor Flights, an organization whose mission is ``to recognize Montana World War II Veterans for their sacrifices and achievements by flying them to Washington, D.C., to see their memorial at no cost.'' Upon one flight's return in 2013, he was a part of the celebrating crowd that welcomed the veterans back at the Billings Logan International Airport with loud cheering and waving of American flags. Newman said, ``It's an honor to be able to stand for them and give them the recognition they deserve.'' Other services Newman has been involved in are the Missing in America Project, assisting families of our fallen heroes in various capacities, helping disabled veterans and homeless veterans in addition to an endless amount of other projects for those in need. Montana has a rich legacy of military service, and Bob is a true Montana hero and role model for us all. It takes a devoted and courageous person to sacrifice their life to protect the lives and freedom that we hold so dear.

Madam President, today I wish to recognize SSG Kat Kaelin for her outstanding contributions in serving our country. In 2011, Staff Sergeant Kaelin was selected to serve as a member of a 20- woman cultural support team, CST, that assisted Special Operations missions in locating terrorists for an 8 month period. It gives me great pleasure to recognize her achievement in qualifying for this prestigious position and for her continued dedication in serving the female military community. Staff Sergeant Kaelin joined the Nevada National Guard while she was still in her junior year of high school at Spring Creek High School. Beginning in August of 2011, she served in an 8-month mission in Iraq as a member of CST-2. The team was designed specifically to serve as a resource for the 75th Ranger Regiment in its mission by gathering information from Afghan [[Page S3024]] women and children. To become a member of the team, Staff Sergeant Kaelin endured intense fitness training and psychological testing. After successfully finishing training, she became the first and only woman from the Nevada National Guard to join a CST. Staff Sergeant Kaelin earned a Combat Action Badge for her service in this role. Her sacrifice in defending our freedoms is invaluable. In May of 2012, Staff Sergeant Kaelin returned to the United States, and she is currently finishing her military career in the Inactive Ready Reserves. Since returning from deployment, she has dedicated her time to a new mission to help others returning home from service. Specifically, she has been fighting to assist women veterans and their children who are homeless. She has become a powerful voice on behalf of female veterans, and I am thankful for all that she has done for our country and the State of Nevada. She is now running for Ms. Veteran America for 2016 in her endeavors to increase awareness for female veterans. I wish her the best of luck in this competition. I extend my deepest gratitude to Staff Sergeant Kaelin for her courageous contributions to our Nation. Her unwavering dedication to her career is commendable, and she stands as a shining example for future generations of heroes. Staff Sergeant Kaelin's service to her country and her bravery earn her a place among the outstanding men and women who have valiantly defended our Nation. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize Congress has a responsibility not only to honor the brave individuals who serve our Nation, but also to ensure they are cared for when they return home. Equally as important, it is crucial that female servicemembers and veterans have access to their specific health care needs. There are countless distinguished women who have made sacrifices beyond measure and deserve nothing but the best treatment. I remain committed to upholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation and will continue to fight until this becomes a reality. Throughout her tenure, Staff Sergeant Kaelin has demonstrated professionalism, commitment to excellence, and dedication to the highest standards of the U.S. Army. I am both humbled and honored by her service and am proud to have had someone from the Nevada National Guard serve our Nation in such a significant role. Today I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Staff Sergeant Kaelin for all of her accomplishments and wish her well in her future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3023-S3024] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT KAT KAELIN Mr. HELLER.

CREC-2016-05-19-pt1-PgS3024,CREC-2016-05-19,114,REMEMBERING ANNE PERSHING,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3024] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING ANNE PERSHING Mr. HELLER. Madam President, today we honor the life and legacy of Anne Pershing, whose passing signifies a great loss to Nevada. I send my condolences and prayers to her family and friends during this time of difficulty. Ms. Pershing was an upstanding Nevadan, committed to bringing journalistic excellence to the Fallon community. She will be sorely missed by the entire Nevada family. Ms. Pershing was raised in Bushnell, IL, and moved to the Silver State over 30 years ago. She received her bachelor's degree in speech communications, in addition to studying journalism, at the University of Nevada, Reno, UNR. In 1983, she started her professional career working for the Lahontan Valley News as a general assignment reporter. By 1987, she had successfully climbed the ladder and was chosen to serve as editor of the newspaper and, later, as general manager. During her tenure, Ms. Pershing went above and beyond in her role to become acquainted with the city of Fallon and its residents, embodying what it means to be a true community journalist. Throughout the late 1990s, Ms. Pershing and her team covered the child leukemia cluster that greatly affected the local community, gaining national attention for her work on the breaking story. Ms. Pershing and her team were later recognized for their efforts by being nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in Public Service and were honored in 2002 with an Associated Press Public Service Award. Ms. Pershing stands as a role model to the Nevada journalism community with her commendable and reliable reporting. We will always remember her resilient spirit in shining light on issues important to our State. In 2004, Ms. Pershing moved on to work for the Star Press, a small weekly newspaper in Fallon, and after this newspaper ceased publication, she continued writing as a contributing columnist for the publication at the School of Medicine at UNR. In 2008, she was inducted into the Nevada Press Association Hall of Fame for all of her efforts. Ms. Pershing spent her final journalistic years writing in her weekly newspaper column about the most important issues affecting Nevada's senior population. Throughout her decades of service to Nevada journalism, Ms. Pershing demonstrated unwavering dedication to bringing Nevadans truthful and insightful news coverage.

Madam President, today we honor the life and legacy of Anne Pershing, whose passing signifies a great loss to Nevada. I send my condolences and prayers to her family and friends during this time of difficulty. Ms. Pershing was an upstanding Nevadan, committed to bringing journalistic excellence to the Fallon community. She will be sorely missed by the entire Nevada family. Ms. Pershing was raised in Bushnell, IL, and moved to the Silver State over 30 years ago. She received her bachelor's degree in speech communications, in addition to studying journalism, at the University of Nevada, Reno, UNR. In 1983, she started her professional career working for the Lahontan Valley News as a general assignment reporter. By 1987, she had successfully climbed the ladder and was chosen to serve as editor of the newspaper and, later, as general manager. During her tenure, Ms. Pershing went above and beyond in her role to become acquainted with the city of Fallon and its residents, embodying what it means to be a true community journalist. Throughout the late 1990s, Ms. Pershing and her team covered the child leukemia cluster that greatly affected the local community, gaining national attention for her work on the breaking story. Ms. Pershing and her team were later recognized for their efforts by being nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in Public Service and were honored in 2002 with an Associated Press Public Service Award. Ms. Pershing stands as a role model to the Nevada journalism community with her commendable and reliable reporting. We will always remember her resilient spirit in shining light on issues important to our State. In 2004, Ms. Pershing moved on to work for the Star Press, a small weekly newspaper in Fallon, and after this newspaper ceased publication, she continued writing as a contributing columnist for the publication at the School of Medicine at UNR. In 2008, she was inducted into the Nevada Press Association Hall of Fame for all of her efforts. Ms. Pershing spent her final journalistic years writing in her weekly newspaper column about the most important issues affecting Nevada's senior population. Throughout her decades of service to Nevada journalism, Ms. Pershing demonstrated unwavering dedication to bringing Nevadans truthful and insightful news coverage. She was truly one-of-a- kind in her endeavors to support her local community. Her legacy of kindness, loyalty, and drive will echo on for years to come.

A bill to prevent the proposed amendments to rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure from taking effect; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague Senator Paul from Kentucky, Senator Baldwin from Wisconsin, and Senators Daines and Tester from Montana, am introducing the Stopping Mass Hacking Act, S. 2952, a bill to protect millions of law-abiding Americans from Government hacking. On April 28, 2016, at the request of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Courts recommended administrative changes to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the rule [[Page S3033]] that governs search and seizure procedure. The changes have been approved by the Supreme Court, and pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act the amendments take effect on December 1, 2016, absent Congressional action. Despite the seriousness of the changes, Congress has not spoken on the subject. It should. Making changes like this simply by administrative fiat is not good enough. So, today, Senator Paul and I introduce this bill. The administrative changes will provide a magistrate judge with the authority to issue a warrant for remote electronic searches of devices located anywhere in the world when law enforcement does not know the location of the device. While it may be appropriate to address the issue of allowing a remote electronic search for a device at an unknown location, Congress needs to consider what protections must be in place to protect Americans' digital security and privacy. This is a new and uncertain area of law, so there needs to be full and careful debate. The second part of the change to Rule 41 gives a magistrate judge the authority to issue a single warrant that would authorize the search of a large number--potentially thousands or millions--of devices that can cover any number of searches in any jurisdiction. These changes would dramatically expand the government's hacking and surveillance authority. The American public should understand that these changes will not just affect criminals: computer security experts and civil liberties advocates say the amendments would also dramatically expand the government's ability to hack the electronic devices of law-abiding Americans if their devices were affected by a computer attack. Finally, these changes to Rule 41 would also give some types of electronic searches different, weaker notification requirements than physical searches. This raises the possibility of the FBI hacking into a person's computer after they are the victim of a cyber attack and not telling them about it until afterward, if at all. Under this new rule, they are only required to make ``reasonable efforts'' to notify people that their computers were searched. You can see how that might be problematic. It could lead to circumstances in which law-abiding Americans are not told that the government has secretly hacked into their computer. These changes are a major policy shift that will impact Americans' digital security, the government's surveillance powers and the Fourth Amendment. Part of the problem is the simple fact that both the American public and security experts know so little about how the government goes about hacking a computer to search it. If a victim's Fourth Amendment rights are violated, it might not be readily apparent because of the highly technical nature of the methods used to execute the warrant. As a body of elected representatives, it is Congress's job to make sure we do not let the Executive Branch run roughshod over our constituents' rights. That is why action is so important: this is a policy question that should be debated by Congress. Although the Department of Justice has tried to describe this rule change as simply a matter of judicial venue, sometimes a difference in scale really is a difference in kind. By allowing so many searches with the order of just a single judge, Congress's failure to act on this issue would be a disaster for law-abiding Americans. When the public realizes what is at stake, I think there is going to be a massive outcry: Americans will look at Congress and say, ``What were you thinking?'' I am here today, introducing this legislation, to sound an alarm. This rule change would could have a massive impact on Americans' digital security and privacy, and I plan on spending the next seven months making sure my colleagues fully understand the huge ramifications of inaction. I thank my colleague Senator Paul for his efforts on this bill, and I hope the Judiciary Committee will consider our proposal quickly. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3032-S3033] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Paul, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Daines, and Mr. Tester): S. 2952.

On April 28, 2016, at the request of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Courts recommended administrative changes to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the rule [[Page S3033]] that governs search and seizure procedure. The changes have been approved by the Supreme Court, and pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act the amendments take effect on December 1, 2016, absent Congressional action. Despite the seriousness of the changes, Congress has not spoken on the subject. It should. Making changes like this simply by administrative fiat is not good enough. So, today, Senator Paul and I introduce this bill. The administrative changes will provide a magistrate judge with the authority to issue a warrant for remote electronic searches of devices located anywhere in the world when law enforcement does not know the location of the device. While it may be appropriate to address the issue of allowing a remote electronic search for a device at an unknown location, Congress needs to consider what protections must be in place to protect Americans' digital security and privacy. This is a new and uncertain area of law, so there needs to be full and careful debate. The second part of the change to Rule 41 gives a magistrate judge the authority to issue a single warrant that would authorize the search of a large number--potentially thousands or millions--of devices that can cover any number of searches in any jurisdiction. These changes would dramatically expand the government's hacking and surveillance authority. The American public should understand that these changes will not just affect criminals: computer security experts and civil liberties advocates say the amendments would also dramatically expand the government's ability to hack the electronic devices of law-abiding Americans if their devices were affected by a computer attack. Finally, these changes to Rule 41 would also give some types of electronic searches different, weaker notification requirements than physical searches. This raises the possibility of the FBI hacking into a person's computer after they are the victim of a cyber attack and not telling them about it until afterward, if at all. Under this new rule, they are only required to make ``reasonable efforts'' to notify people that their computers were searched. You can see how that might be problematic. It could lead to circumstances in which law-abiding Americans are not told that the government has secretly hacked into their computer. These changes are a major policy shift that will impact Americans' digital security, the government's surveillance powers and the Fourth Amendment. Part of the problem is the simple fact that both the American public and security experts know so little about how the government goes about hacking a computer to search it. If a victim's Fourth Amendment rights are violated, it might not be readily apparent because of the highly technical nature of the methods used to execute the warrant. As a body of elected representatives, it is Congress's job to make sure we do not let the Executive Branch run roughshod over our constituents' rights. That is why action is so important: this is a policy question that should be debated by Congress. Although the Department of Justice has tried to describe this rule change as simply a matter of judicial venue, sometimes a difference in scale really is a difference in kind. By allowing so many searches with the order of just a single judge, Congress's failure to act on this issue would be a disaster for law-abiding Americans. When the public realizes what is at stake, I think there is going to be a massive outcry: Americans will look at Congress and say, ``What were you thinking?'' I am here today, introducing this legislation, to sound an alarm. This rule change would could have a massive impact on Americans' digital security and privacy, and I plan on spending the next seven months making sure my colleagues fully understand the huge ramifications of inaction. I thank my colleague Senator Paul for his efforts on this bill, and I hope the Judiciary Committee will consider our proposal quickly. ____________________",package_114_17.csv,4956,4956,5023,"[congressional record volume 162, number 80 (thursday, may 19, 2016)] [senate] [pages s3032-s3033] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions by mr. wyden (for himself, mr. paul, ms. baldwin, mr. daines, and mr. tester): s. 2952. a bill to prevent the proposed amendments to rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure from taking effect;

CREC-2016-05-19-pt1-PgS3032-2,CREC-2016-05-19,114,Introductory Statement on S. 2952,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3032-S3033] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Paul, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Daines, and Mr. Tester): S. 2952. A bill to prevent the proposed amendments to rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure from taking effect; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague Senator Paul from Kentucky, Senator Baldwin from Wisconsin, and Senators Daines and Tester from Montana, am introducing the Stopping Mass Hacking Act, S. 2952, a bill to protect millions of law-abiding Americans from Government hacking. On April 28, 2016, at the request of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Courts recommended administrative changes to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the rule [[Page S3033]] that governs search and seizure procedure. The changes have been approved by the Supreme Court, and pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act the amendments take effect on December 1, 2016, absent Congressional action. Despite the seriousness of the changes, Congress has not spoken on the subject. It should. Making changes like this simply by administrative fiat is not good enough. So, today, Senator Paul and I introduce this bill. The administrative changes will provide a magistrate judge with the authority to issue a warrant for remote electronic searches of devices located anywhere in the world when law enforcement does not know the location of the device. While it may be appropriate to address the issue of allowing a remote electronic search for a device at an unknown location, Congress needs to consider what protections must be in place to protect Americans' digital security and privacy. This is a new and uncertain area of law, so there needs to be full and careful debate. The second part of the change to Rule 41 gives a magistrate judge the authority to issue a single warrant that would authorize the search of a large number--potentially thousands or millions--of devices that can cover any number of searches in any jurisdiction. These changes would dramatically expand the government's hacking and surveillance authority. The American public should understand that these changes will not just affect criminals: computer security experts and civil liberties advocates say the amendments would also dramatically expand the government's ability to hack the electronic devices of law-abiding Americans if their devices were affected by a computer attack. Finally, these changes to Rule 41 would also give some types of electronic searches different, weaker notification requirements than physical searches. This raises the possibility of the FBI hacking into a person's computer after they are the victim of a cyber attack and not telling them about it until afterward, if at all. Under this new rule, they are only required to make ``reasonable efforts'' to notify people that their computers were searched. You can see how that might be problematic. It could lead to circumstances in which law-abiding Americans are not told that the government has secretly hacked into their computer. These changes are a major policy shift that will impact Americans' digital security, the government's surveillance powers and the Fourth Amendment. Part of the problem is the simple fact that both the American public and security experts know so little about how the government goes about hacking a computer to search it. If a victim's Fourth Amendment rights are violated, it might not be readily apparent because of the highly technical nature of the methods used to execute the warrant. As a body of elected representatives, it is Congress's job to make sure we do not let the Executive Branch run roughshod over our constituents' rights. That is why action is so important: this is a policy question that should be debated by Congress. Although the Department of Justice has tried to describe this rule change as simply a matter of judicial venue, sometimes a difference in scale really is a difference in kind. By allowing so many searches with the order of just a single judge, Congress's failure to act on this issue would be a disaster for law-abiding Americans. When the public realizes what is at stake, I think there is going to be a massive outcry: Americans will look at Congress and say, ``What were you thinking?''

A bill to prevent the proposed amendments to rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure from taking effect; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague Senator Paul from Kentucky, Senator Baldwin from Wisconsin, and Senators Daines and Tester from Montana, am introducing the Stopping Mass Hacking Act, S. 2952, a bill to protect millions of law-abiding Americans from Government hacking. On April 28, 2016, at the request of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Courts recommended administrative changes to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the rule [[Page S3033]] that governs search and seizure procedure. The changes have been approved by the Supreme Court, and pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act the amendments take effect on December 1, 2016, absent Congressional action. Despite the seriousness of the changes, Congress has not spoken on the subject. It should. Making changes like this simply by administrative fiat is not good enough. So, today, Senator Paul and I introduce this bill. The administrative changes will provide a magistrate judge with the authority to issue a warrant for remote electronic searches of devices located anywhere in the world when law enforcement does not know the location of the device. While it may be appropriate to address the issue of allowing a remote electronic search for a device at an unknown location, Congress needs to consider what protections must be in place to protect Americans' digital security and privacy. This is a new and uncertain area of law, so there needs to be full and careful debate. The second part of the change to Rule 41 gives a magistrate judge the authority to issue a single warrant that would authorize the search of a large number--potentially thousands or millions--of devices that can cover any number of searches in any jurisdiction. These changes would dramatically expand the government's hacking and surveillance authority. The American public should understand that these changes will not just affect criminals: computer security experts and civil liberties advocates say the amendments would also dramatically expand the government's ability to hack the electronic devices of law-abiding Americans if their devices were affected by a computer attack.

whereas united states economic aid prevented taiwan from sliding into an economic depression in the 1950s and greatly contributed to the island's later economic takeoff; whereas taiwan has flourished to become a beacon of democracy in asia and leading trade partner for the united states, and the relationship has endured for more than 65 years through many shifts in asia's geopolitical landscape; whereas the strong relationship between the united states and taiwan is based on mutually beneficial security, commercial, and cultural ties; whereas deputy assistant secretary of state susan thornton stated in her testimony before the committee on foreign affairs of the house of representatives on february 11, 2016, that ``the people on taiwan have built a prosperous, free, and orderly society with strong institutions, worthy of emulation and envy'';

whereas each successive united states administration since the enactment of the taiwan relations act has provided arms of a defensive character to taiwan; whereas a 2015 department of defense report to congress on military and security developments involving the people's republic of china stated that, ``preparing for potential conflict in the taiwan strait remains the focus and primary driver of china's military investment'';

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, May 16, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 88 reaffirming the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) and the six assurances as cornerstones of the United States-Taiwan relations. Since its enactment, the TRA has played an indispensable role in shaping U.S.-Taiwan relations, resulting in a mutually-beneficial relationship that encourages strong security, cultural, and economic ties. The TRA is unique because it is the only law to govern nearly every aspect of U.S. relations within a foreign government in the absence of diplomatic relations. Taiwan's story is unique in that it is an example to the world of the potential of a country. Indeed, Taiwan and the United States share many values including: 1. a commitment to democracy; 2. a commitment to human rights and the rule of law; and 3. a commitment to economic prosperity. Maintaining and deepening our strong relations with Taiwan is an important part of U.S. engagement in Asia, a region of great and growing importance to the United States. This includes a vital security and strategic interest within the Taiwan Strait, where United States troops are stationed within the Taiwan Strait region. Further, Taiwan has grown to become America's ninth-largest overall trading partner and our seventh-largest destination for agricultural exports. Indeed, I am particularly proud that as a Member of the Congressional Caucus on Taiwan, my colleagues and I can serve an important role in strengthening bilateral relations by engaging our counterparts in Taiwan. Not too long ago, we commemorated the 37th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act. I encourage my colleagues to continue to join me in support of and in promotion of our bilateral relations with Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, I commend the speech delivered by Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou on March 30, 2016, in which he emphasized the strong and abiding friendship between Taiwan and the United States, which was integral to Taiwan's transformation into the free, prosperous, and just society it is today. President Ma also spoke of Taiwan's future through the lens of three key issues: 1. cross-strait relations; 2. energy; and 3. economic development. President Ma also mentioned that through the effort to seek peace, Taiwan has become a peacemaker and provider of humanitarian aid. I also want to congratulate Taiwan on the January 16, 2016 election of the first female President to be elected--Dr. Tsai Ing-wen. Mr. Speaker, the inauguration of President Dr. Tsai Ing-wen is the third peaceful transition of power in Taiwan's democratic history. The United States congratulates the people and government of Taiwan on the election of President Tsai Ing-wen and Taiwan's enduring and strong commitment to nurturing democracy, human rights and the rule-of- law. This is why I support and urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 88. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E745] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REAFFIRMATION OF THE TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT AND THE SIX ASSURANCES ______ speech of HON.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Tuesday, May 17, 2016 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4909) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes: Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, because it fails to support our troops serving overseas. The House Armed Services Committee reported a bill that uses a budget gimmick to circumvent funding caps Congress passed into law on a bipartisan basis, and by doing so it not only undermines the budget process, it puts our troops at risk. The bill cuts $18 billion from what our military commanders say is needed to support our troops overseas, and shifts those funds into the base defense budget to purchase billions of dollars of weapon systems the Defense Department did not even request. Consequently, the bill provides only enough funding for the troops deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq through April, 2017. This would then force Congress to pass an emergency supplemental to ensure that troops who are serving in harm's way have the resources they need for the remainder of the year. We shouldn't gamble with the troops we send off to battle. They deserve predictable support for the entire year as they execute their missions, particularly in view of the dangers they face. Representative Ellison offered an amendment to undo part of this gimmick. His amendment cuts $9.4 billion of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds the bill shifted to procurement for weapons DoD didn't ask for and puts it back into operations and maintenance, where DoD requested it for overseas operations. I supported the amendment because it puts the troops first. It gives them the certainty they need while they carry out their missions. It is also what our military commanders say they need. Unfortunately, that amendment did not pass. As the Ranking Member of the House Budget Committee, I also have worked hard to defend the integrity of the budget process and to end the abuse of the OCO designation to circumvent budget caps. I offered a bipartisan amendment with Representative Mulvaney that attempts to help reduce this abuse in the future. The amendment codifies criteria developed by OMB to clarify when military spending should be designated as contingency operations. To provide the necessary resources for a strong military and vital domestic investments, it is imperative our budget process be transparent and deliberative. Using budget gimmicks perpetuates bad decisions, increases debt by obfuscating spending, and in this case, puts the troops at risk. This NDAA once again abdicates Congressional responsibility to revise and update the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). The 2001 AUMF has been used to conduct a broad range of military operations across the world for the past fifteen years. Rather than act to narrowly target that authority to meet our current operational and national security requirements, Congress has continued to provide the Executive with a blank check to deploy American ground troops in many places in the Middle East and elsewhere around the globe. Representative Lee offered an amendment to force Congress to meet its constitutional obligations regarding its war powers. While I do not believe we should totally eliminate all authorities under the 2001 AUMF, I do believe we need to dramatically reduce its scope and end the grant of blank check authority to the Executive. The NDAA should focus only on soldiers and their needs. However, Republicans have used it as a vehicle to insert inflammatory and non- germane amendments. It includes an amendment that reverses the President's Executive Order that prevents federal contractors from discriminating against LGBT employees. It removes environmental protections, impedes development of alternative fuel sources to decrease our dependence on foreign fuel, and it prevents the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. I applaud certain measures such as the 2.1 percent pay raise for armed services, research to combat the opioid epidemic that is impacting our veterans, increased funding to combat veteran homelessness, and expanding the parental leave policy for active duty service members. I remain committed to fighting for these important issues but I cannot support the unacceptable budget gimmicks and policy riders in the underlying bill. Mr. Chair, I vote nay. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E746] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 ______ speech of HON.

congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 ______ speech of hon. chris van hollen of maryland in the house of representatives tuesday, may 17, 2016 the house in committee of the whole house on the state of the union had under consideration the bill (h.r. 4909) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the department of defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes: mr. van hollen. mr. chair, i rise today in opposition to h.r. 4909, the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017, because it fails to support our troops serving overseas. the house armed services committee reported a bill that uses a budget gimmick to circumvent funding caps congress passed into law on a bipartisan basis, and by doing so it not only undermines the budget process, it puts our troops at risk. the bill cuts $18 billion from what our military commanders say is needed to support our troops overseas, and shifts those funds into the base defense budget to purchase billions of dollars of weapon systems the defense department did not even request. consequently, the bill provides only enough funding for the troops deployed in afghanistan and iraq through april, 2017. this would then force congress to pass an emergency supplemental to ensure that troops who are serving in harm's way have the resources they need for the remainder of the year. we shouldn't gamble with the troops we send off to battle. they deserve predictable support for the entire year as they execute their missions, particularly in view of the dangers they face. representative ellison offered an amendment to undo part of this gimmick. his amendment cuts $9.4 billion of overseas contingency operations (oco) funds the bill shifted to procurement for weapons dod didn't ask for and puts it back into operations and maintenance, where dod requested it for overseas operations. i supported the amendment because it puts the troops first. it gives them the certainty they need while they carry out their missions. it is also what our military commanders say they need. unfortunately, that amendment did not pass. as the ranking member of the house budget committee, i also have worked hard to defend the integrity of the budget process and to end the abuse of the oco designation to circumvent budget caps. i offered a bipartisan amendment with representative mulvaney that attempts to help reduce this abuse in the future. the amendment codifies criteria developed by omb to clarify when military spending should be designated as contingency operations. to provide the necessary resources for a strong military and vital domestic investments, it is imperative our budget process be transparent and deliberative. using budget gimmicks perpetuates bad decisions, increases debt by obfuscating spending, and in this case, puts the troops at risk. this ndaa once again abdicates congressional responsibility to revise and update the 2001 authorization for use of military force (aumf). the 2001 aumf has been used to conduct a broad range of military operations across the world for the past fifteen years. rather than act to narrowly target that authority to meet our current operational and national security requirements, congress has continued to provide the executive with a blank check to deploy american ground troops in many places in the middle east and elsewhere around the globe. representative lee offered an amendment to force congress to meet its constitutional obligations regarding its war powers. while i do not believe we should totally eliminate all authorities under the 2001 aumf, i do believe we need to dramatically reduce its scope and end the grant of blank check authority to the executive. the ndaa should focus only on soldiers and their needs. however, republicans have used it as a vehicle to insert inflammatory and non- germane amendments. it includes an amendment that reverses the president's executive order that prevents federal contractors from discriminating against lgbt employees. it removes environmental protections, impedes development of alternative fuel sources to decrease our dependence on foreign fuel, and it prevents the closure of the guantanamo bay detention facility. i applaud certain measures such as the 2.1 percent pay raise for armed services, research to combat the opioid epidemic that is impacting

THOMAS J. ROONEY of florida in the house of representatives Thursday, May 19, 2016 Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the distinguished career of retired Marine Colonel Rocky McPherson, who is retiring after 50 years of service to our nation and the state of Florida. Upon graduating from the United States Naval Academy in 1966, Rocky was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United [[Page E747]] States Marine Corps and began his military career with a ground combat tour in Vietnam. After one year as an infantry officer he transitioned into the aviation community and is the only Marine officer with both ground and aviation combat tours during the Vietnam War. During Rocky's continued military service, he commanded the Marine All Weather Attack Squadron 121 aboard the USS Ranger, the Marine Air Training Support Group at Whidbey Island, Washington, and served as the Chief of Staff, III Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, Japan. His final assignment before retiring from the Marine Corps was at Marine Corps Headquarters as the Deputy Director, Manpower Division. Rocky then served as the Executive Director of the Florida Department of Veterans' Affairs, where he oversaw the most significant expansion of state veterans' nursing homes in decades, led department efforts to support Florida's returning severely wounded service members, and spearheaded plans to design and build the Florida World War II Memorial and monument--a replica of the larger monument located here in Washington, D.C. His personal and professional dedication to improving services for Florida's veterans has made a tremendous and lasting impact on the lives of over 1.5 million veterans and their family members in Florida. Most recently, Rocky has used his talents to advance the mission of Enterprise Florida, a public-private partnership between Florida's business and government leaders that aims to encourage economic development in the state of Florida. As the organization's Vice President for Military and Defense Programs, Rocky has worked to protect, preserve, and improve Florida's military installations, as well as the communities surrounding those bases. Rocky's unparalleled experience and knowledge of military and defense issues have made him both a leader at the national level and an invaluable resource for Governors, State Legislators, and local defense community leaders across the state. Mr. Speaker, I thank Colonel Rocky McPherson for the duty and honor he has consistently displayed throughout his 17 years of outstanding service to the state of Florida. We are truly better off because of his hard work, and I wish Rocky, his wife of 34 years Connie, their children Ashley, Nathan and Courtney, and their grandson, Jack all the best in the years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E746-E747] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF COLONEL ROCKY McPHERSON ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I rise to honor the life of a much loved community and spiritual leader, Apostle William T. Broadous, who passed away on Tuesday, May 3, 2016, at the age of 71. Apostle William T. Broadous was born on December 1, 1944 in Portland, Oregon to Dr. Hillery T. and Rosa L. Broadous, who founded Calvary Baptist Church in Pacoima in 1955. Apostle Broadous overcame challenges throughout his life, defying the odds, going on to found schools, lead missionary trips to Africa, and be a voice for the community. Apostle Broadous continued the strong family tradition of social justice, service and commitment to Pacoima and the San Fernando Valley. He was a strong supporter of community empowerment programs such as the San Fernando Valley Chapter of the NAACP and the Boys and Girls Club, as well as the Alicia Broadous-Duncan Senior Center in Pacoima. After going to school at Bishop College in Dallas, TX, and spending nine years as the Pastor of New Bethel Baptist Church and director of several community centers, Apostle Broadous returned to the Valley. Upon his return, he joined his father at Calvary Baptist Church and embraced his new role as Pastor after his father's passing in 1982. Apostle Broadous dedicated his life to his community and his congregation, preaching at Calvary Baptist Church up until the day of his passing. Apostle Broadous will be sorely missed in the San Fernando Valley. He is survived by his wife, Pastor Gloria L. Broadous, his children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and siblings, nieces and nephews. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Apostle William T. Broadous.

CREC-2016-05-19-pt1-PgE748,CREC-2016-05-19,114,CONGRATULATING NAPSEC ON 45 YEARS OF SERVICE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E748] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING NAPSEC ON 45 YEARS OF SERVICE ______ HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Thursday, May 19, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the National Association of Private Special Education Centers (NAPSEC) for their 45 years of excellent service and academic dedication to our country's individuals with disabilities. NAPSEC's educational therapeutic services, combined with over four decades of experience, are invaluable to the education community across the United States and to the many partners in my home state of New Jersey. Established in 1971, NAPSEC represents private specialized education programs including early intervention services, school programs, residential therapeutic centers, and college experience and adult living programs for individuals with disabilities and their families. The majority of NAPSEC's member programs provide services to publicly placed students with disabilities through the Continuum of Alternative Placements and Services required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Originally enacted into law in 1975, IDEA is the primary federal statute governing special education for children from birth through age 21 and guaranteeing the rights of children with disabilities to a free public education that suits their needs. Nationwide, 6.6 million students with disabilities are ensured of and receive an education because of IDEA. While many of these children are successfully integrated into public schools and typical classrooms, IDEA requires that a variety of options are available to meet the individual needs of disabled students. Of these students, 3.4 percent are served in private specialized day and/or residential programs. NAPSEC member programs meet a vital need for individuals who are not able to thrive in a typical classroom environment, acknowledging each individual's unique experience, because every child has the right to an education that empowers them to succeed. NAPSEC's hundreds of affiliates bridge the gap and offer much needed services to publically and privately placed individuals. In addition to K-12 education, these services also include early intervention services for infants and toddlers. As co-chair of the Coalition on Autism Research and Education (CARE), I've seen firsthand the impact that early intervention makes in successful outcomes for children and applaud this attention to early intervention. Additionally, NAPSEC programs provide postsecondary college experience and adult living programs that serve individuals who have aged out of their school based supports and are no longer eligible for services under IDEA. As 50,000 individuals with autism, and many more with other disabilities, age out of their education based supports every year, supports and services for these individuals are critically necessary in ensuring that young adults with disabilities can successfully transition into the next phase of their lives. Their services needs do not end when they turn 21. NAPSEC programs improve educational outcomes for people with disabilities and empower them to achieve their full potential and make meaningful contributions to society. When individuals with disabilities are empowered to achieve, we all benefit. I remain impressed by the quality of care and expertise NAPSEC's partners provide to America's students with disabilities, including those with autism. Again, I offer NAPSEC my sincerest congratulations and gratitude for their 45 years of service to the disabilities community and look forward to NAPSEC's continued progress in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E748] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING NAPSEC ON 45 YEARS OF SERVICE ______ HON.

NAPSEC member programs meet a vital need for individuals who are not able to thrive in a typical classroom environment, acknowledging each individual's unique experience, because every child has the right to an education that empowers them to succeed. NAPSEC's hundreds of affiliates bridge the gap and offer much needed services to publically and privately placed individuals. In addition to K-12 education, these services also include early intervention services for infants and toddlers. As co-chair of the Coalition on Autism Research and Education (CARE), I've seen firsthand the impact that early intervention makes in successful outcomes for children and applaud this attention to early intervention. Additionally, NAPSEC programs provide postsecondary college experience and adult living programs that serve individuals who have aged out of their school based supports and are no longer eligible for services under IDEA. As 50,000 individuals with autism, and many more with other disabilities, age out of their education based supports every year, supports and services for these individuals are critically necessary in ensuring that young adults with disabilities can successfully transition into the next phase of their lives. Their services needs do not end when they turn 21. NAPSEC programs improve educational outcomes for people with disabilities and empower them to achieve their full potential and make meaningful contributions to society. When individuals with disabilities are empowered to achieve, we all benefit. I remain impressed by the quality of care and expertise NAPSEC's partners provide to America's students with disabilities, including those with autism. Again, I offer NAPSEC my sincerest congratulations and gratitude for their 45 years of service to the disabilities community and look forward to NAPSEC's continued progress in the future. ____________________",package_114_17.csv,3870,3870,3937,"[congressional record volume 162, number 80 (thursday, may 19, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e748] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] congratulating napsec on 45 years of service ______ hon. christopher h. smith of new jersey in the house of representatives thursday, may 19, 2016 mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i rise today to congratulate the national association of private special education centers (napsec) for their 45 years of excellent service and academic dedication to our country's individuals with disabilities. napsec's educational therapeutic services, combined with over four decades of experience, are invaluable to the education community across the united states and to the many partners in my home state of new jersey. established in 1971, napsec represents private specialized education programs including early intervention services, school programs, residential therapeutic centers, and college experience and adult living programs for individuals with disabilities and their families. the majority of napsec's member programs provide services to publicly placed students with disabilities through the continuum of alternative placements and services required by the individuals with disabilities education act (idea). originally enacted into law in 1975, idea is the primary federal statute governing special education for children from birth through age 21 and guaranteeing the rights of children with disabilities to a free public education that suits their needs. nationwide, 6.6 million students with disabilities are ensured of and receive an education because of idea. while many of these children are successfully integrated into public schools and typical classrooms, idea requires that a variety of options are available to meet the individual needs of disabled students. of these students, 3.4 percent are served in private specialized day and/or residential programs. napsec member programs meet a vital need for individuals who are not able to thrive in a typical classroom environment, acknowledging each individual's unique experience, because every child has the right to an education that empowers them to succeed. napsec's hundreds of affiliates bridge the gap and offer much needed services to publically and privately placed individuals. in addition to k-12 education, these services also include early intervention services for infants and toddlers. as co-chair of the coalition on autism research and education (care), i've seen firsthand the impact that early intervention makes in successful outcomes for children and applaud this attention to early intervention. additionally, napsec programs provide postsecondary college experience and adult living programs that serve individuals who have aged out of their school based supports and are no longer eligible for services under idea. as 50,000 individuals with autism, and many more with other disabilities, age out of their education based supports every year, supports and services for these individuals are critically necessary in ensuring that young adults with disabilities can successfully transition into the next phase of their lives. their services needs do not end when they turn 21. napsec programs improve educational outcomes for people with disabilities and empower them to achieve their full potential and make meaningful contributions to society. when individuals with disabilities are empowered to achieve, we all benefit. i remain impressed by the quality of care and expertise napsec's partners provide to america's students with disabilities, including those with autism. again, i offer napsec my sincerest congratulations and gratitude for their 45 years of service to the disabilities community and look forward to napsec's continued progress in the future. ____________________",3870

SAM FARR of california in the house of representatives Thursday, May 19, 2016 Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of one of the most joyous and remarkable leaders that I have met in my 40 years of elective office. Rabbi Richard Litvak will retire this summer after 40 years of leadership at Temple Beth El in Aptos, California. In those years he has touched thousands of lives, nurturing their spiritual lives, counseling them in times of grief, bringing smiles in times of joy, and as a licensed family counselor, maybe even saving a few marriages. With the exception of my father, the late Fred Farr, there is no man who I admire more for his exuberant humanity and transcendent love for all those around him. Born in St. Joseph, Missouri, Rick grew up in a close-knit family whose social life centered around their own community's synagogue. In high school, he joined a Jewish youth group and a Mitzvah Corps program. That grounding in Reform Judaism encouraged his involvement in interfaith dialogue and Jewish social justice activism. This background led Rick to study at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio. He holds an MA in Hebrew Arts and Letters and is a rabbinic member of the Chesky Institute for Judaism and Psychotherapy. Rick first came to Temple Beth El in 1975--the same year I was sworn in as a Monterey County Supervisor--as a student rabbi, and then in 1977 became its first full time rabbi. Under his leadership, the Temple community grew steadily, from 50 families to over 500 today. He added religious programs, Jewish adult education courses, expanded religious school curriculums, a preschool, and community center activities. Rick also helped lead the development and 1990 opening of the current Temple site. In the broader community, Rick has built a towering reputation for leadership and peace building. He elevated social action and interfaith understanding to a central calling for the Temple Beth El community; supporting its leadership in the ``Out in Our Faith'' movement locally and nationally. People throughout Santa Cruz County and the Monterey Bay Area appreciate Rick for the faith, leadership, and joy that he brings to many social justice causes. Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for the whole House in thanking Rick for his years of service. The world is an immeasurably better place for having Rick among its people. I want to say what a pleasure it has been to work with him these many years. He is such an amazing leader. So much so, that once I heard that he planned to retire, I felt compelled to follow his example and announce my own retirement from elective office. I wish Rick, his amazing wife Nancy, and their daughters Jessica and Gwen, all the best. Shalom, my friend. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E747] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF RABBI RICHARD LITVAK ______ HON.

JIM McDERMOTT of washington in the house of representatives Thursday, May 19, 2016 Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, today, along with fellow Members of Congress, Erik Paulsen, Keith Ellison, and Dave Reichert, I am introducing bipartisan legislation to improve the Low Income Housing Tax Credit to ensure low-income families do not have to choose between stable, affordable housing and education. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is a highly successful tool for financing affordable housing and one of the premier examples of the government leveraging its resources in order to maximize outcomes through public-private partnerships. Unfortunately, a well-intentioned limitation called the ``student rule'' currently forces some of the most in-need to choose between housing and education. The ``student rule'' was designed to prohibit Low Income Housing Tax Credit funds from being used to construct dormitories and to prevent college students, who often have temporarily low incomes, from utilizing resources meant for individuals and families with more serious and longer-term housing needs. Unfortunately, there are no exceptions for those who want to pursue full-time education and are truly in need of housing assistance. Because of this, students may lose access to Low Income Housing Tax Credit-funded housing units if they go to school full-time. Alternatively, if they choose to attend school part-time in order to keep their LIHTC housing eligibility, these students may lose access to grants, loans, and scholarships that are limited to full-time students. The unintended outcome of the ``student rule'' is to hold back truly low-income individuals trying to obtain an education. Our legislation adds two exceptions to the student rule; for formerly homeless youth and [[Page E748]] for formerly homeless veterans. Both of these populations are vulnerable to a return to homelessness. Ensuring they can go to school while maintaining access to affordable housing can help prevent this regression and promote financial independence. These small changes can provide immeasurable help and I hope all of my colleagues will join me in passing this legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E747-E748] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOUSING FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS ACT ______ HON.

The NVFC has been a powerful voice for the volunteer firefighter, EMT and rescue service. Since the Council began, fire death rate per million population declined by 70 percent and on-duty firefighter fatalities have dropped by half. The Council's efforts to promote safety and fire prevention are also noteworthy. The number of fire calls per year is less than half of what it was in 1980. In the last few decades, we have learned more about the additional grave dangers that firefighters face, including cancer, PTSD, vehicle crashes, and heart events. I will continue to work with the NVFC to advocate for the health and safety of the volunteer fire service community. The National Volunteer Fire Council has come a long way since its founding in 1976 and I know it will continue to serve its membership and the greater community well for many years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E748] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL VOLUNTEER FIRE COUNCIL (NVFC) ______ HON.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Wednesday, May 18, 2016 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition of H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations Act of 2016. It is a tepid response to an alarming public health crisis, only providing a small fraction of the amount requested by President Obama and public health experts. The Zika virus poses a severe threat to Americans, especially pregnant women. It has been linked to the birth defect microcephaly, and even death. As we approach the summer months, the prevalence of mosquitoes in our backyards will increase, and more and more Americans will become exposed to the virus. We must provide sufficient emergency funding to contain the spread and develop a vaccine for this virus. Unfortunately, today's bill would only provide approximately $622 million to fight Zika, less than one-third of what public health experts like those at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say is needed. Making matters worse, this bill offsets the cost of fighting Zika by taking vital resources away from addressing other public health crises. Additionally, House Republicans have continued their attack on women's access to health care in this bill by incorporating restrictions on abortion coverage. It is shameful that anti-choice Members have used the urgency of the Zika virus to limit access to a woman's constitutionally affirmed right to choose. It is dangerous to pretend that Congress has addressed this crisis. That illusion creates a false sense of comfort. For these reasons I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and demand appropriate funding to guard Americans from this public health crisis. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E749] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ZIKA RESPONSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 ______ speech of HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor McAuley Catholic High School student Starr Thuerauf, of Joplin, Missouri, on her being accepted as a delegate to the Congress of Future Medical Leaders by the National Academy of Future Physicians and Medical Scientists. The Congress of Future Medical Leaders is an honors-only program that is designed to motivate and direct the top students in the United States. Specifically, it's designed for students aspiring to become physicians or medical researchers, and provides a path and mentorship for students to accomplish their goals. To be considered for acceptance as a delegate, applicants are either recommended by a teacher or member of the Academy based on a proven track record of academic excellence. Delegates represent all 50 states plus Puerto Rico, and must have a minimum 3.5 GPA. Students like Thuerauf who qualify for this incredibly selective honor exemplify top- tier diligence and academic talent. Mr. Speaker, Starr Thuerauf will undoubtedly represent Missouri with distinction during her time as a delegate to this Congress. She has not only shown a strong academic capability during her time at school, but is also a well-rounded individual with a deep interest in the medical field.

ALCEE L. HASTINGS of florida in the house of representatives Thursday, May 19, 2016 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a resolution recognizing the importance of nonprofit organizations and designating September 2016 as ``Nonprofit Organization Recognition Month.'' I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my friend and colleague, Congressman Tom Rooney for again introducing this resolution with me this year. Nonprofit organizations have made many important contributions to our nation. Over the past decade, the number of nonprofits has risen steadily, and there are approximately 1.4 million of them now operating in the United States. These groups work to improve our schools. They work to protect our environment. They work to keep us and our neighbors around the world healthy. Each of them work to enact meaningful change in our world and to improve human lives. Many nonprofits support science and research that will have a significant impact on future generations. Others advocate for vulnerable populations across the globe--for refugees, for the homeless, and for our nation's veterans. They educate and teach, and they engage each of our constituencies on issues that matter most. The nonprofit sector is vital to the economic security of the United States. In fact, the growth rate of the nonprofit sector has surpassed the rate of both the business and government sector. Just a few years ago, in 2010, nonprofits added nearly $780 billion to our national GDP and employed 1 in 10 working Americans. Today, nonprofits contribute nearly $1 trillion to the United States economy annually. In addition, these organizations facilitate charitable giving and community activism, and the combined donations and volunteer hours of individuals to nonprofits are worth billions of dollars annually. But perhaps most importantly, nonprofit organizations are founded and managed by people trying to make the world a better place. Whether they are abroad or at home, the work that these men and women do is incredibly meaningful. Without the people behind these organizations-- working tirelessly to change the world, sometimes just one life at a time--the nonprofit sector would not be the force that it has become today. Mr. Speaker, nonprofit organizations advocate for solutions to some of the great challenges facing our nation and the world, and they deserve to be recognized for their valuable contributions to society. No matter their focus, nonprofits play a pivotal role in shaping the future of America. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and to join me in designating September 2016 as ``Nonprofit Organization Recognition Month.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E750] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2016 AS ``NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION RECOGNITION MONTH'' ______ HON.

CREC-2016-05-19-pt1-PgE751,CREC-2016-05-19,114,"IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 241, THE ACCESS ACT","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E751] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 241, THE ACCESS ACT ______ HON. KEN CALVERT of california in the house of representatives Thursday, May 19, 2016 Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to have had the opportunity to testify today at the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Constitution and Civil Justice Hearing, ``Examining Legislation to Promote the Effective Enforcement of the ADA's Public Accommodation Provisions.'' As you know, the Americans with Disabilities Act is undoubtedly one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation. We can all agree that providing all Americans with access to public accommodations is an invaluable legislative objective. The purpose of the ADA is to ensure access for the disabled to public accommodation and provide appropriate remedial action for those who have suffered harm as a result of noncompliance. Although there are times when litigation by harmed individuals is necessary, there are an increasing number of lawsuits brought under the ADA that are based upon a desire to achieve financial settlements rather than to achieve the appropriate modifications for access. These lawsuits filed by serial litigants, often referred to as ``drive-by lawsuits,'' place exorbitant legal fees on small businesses, and often times business owners are unaware of the specific nature of the allegations brought against them. In early 2011, frivolous ADA lawsuits against small businesses reached an all-time high throughout California, and as a result, my good friend and colleague, former Congressman Dan Lungren (R-CA), championed the issue and introduced the original ACCESS Act (H.R. 3356) in the 112th Congress. I was pleased to have been afforded the opportunity to take over the legislation for reintroduction beginning in the 113th Congress. In January 2015, I reintroduced the legislation as H.R. 241, the ACCESS Act (ADA Compliance for Customer Entry to Stores and Services). H.R. 241 is a cost-free and commonsense piece of legislation that would alleviate the financial burden small businesses are facing, while still fulfilling the purpose of the ADA. Any person aggrieved by a violation of the ADA would provide the owner or operator with a written notice of the violation, specific enough to allow such owner or operator to identify the barrier to their access. Within 60 days the owner or operator would be required to provide the aggrieved person with a description outlining improvements that would be made to address the barrier. The owner or operator would then have 120 days to make the improvement. The failure to meet any of these conditions would allow the lawsuit to go forward. I think we can all agree that we must ensure that individuals with disabilities are afforded the same access and opportunities as those without disabilities. Frivolous lawsuits do not accomplish this goal. Allowing small business owners and cities alike to fix ADA violations within 120 days, rather than waiting for lengthy legal battles to play out, is a more thoughtful, timely, and reasonable approach. While the ADA is a national law, California has become ground zero for ADA violation lawsuits. In fact, California is home to more federal disability lawsuits than the next four states combined. A 2014 report determined that since 2005, more than 10,000 federal ADA lawsuits had been filed in the five states with the highest disabled populations; 7,188 of which were filed in California. Violating the ADA in California carries a minimum $4,000 penalty in addition to the plaintiffs legal fees. As of 2014, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 31 individuals made up at least 56 percent of federal disability lawsuits in California. As was mentioned during the second panel of today's hearing, California has 12 percent of the nation's disabled population, but accounts for over 40 percent of ADA lawsuits. Those figures and the real life toll it takes on small business owners, are why I introduced this legislation to allow for a ``fix-it'' period. However, it is clear that this is not just a major problem in California. The introduction, in November 2015, of similar legislation by the gentleman from Texas, Representative Ted Poe, shows just that. His legislation authorizes a training and education component for the affected community and Certified Access Specialists, which I would welcome and embrace as an amendment to my bill. This is also a bipartisan issue supported by states. I was pleased to see that California SB 269 passed unanimously in the State Assembly and Senate, and was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on May 10th, 2016. SB 269 was authored by a friend of mine, Democratic State Senator, Gen. Richard Roth. The legislation is similar to the ACCESS Act in that it allows businesses to take immediate steps to become accessible by providing them with 120 days, from receipt of a Certified Access Specialist report, to resolve any identified violations without being subject to litigation costs or statutory penalties. I worry that with California acting to curb these lawsuits, some of these serial litigants will try their trade in other states. Without question, the ACCESS Act will ensure that the ADA is used for its true purpose of guaranteed accessibility to public accommodations for all Americans while eliminating abusive, costly and unnecessary lawsuits for small business owners. It is more important than ever that the House of Representatives act to move this vital piece of legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E751] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 241, THE ACCESS ACT ______ HON.

A 2014 report determined that since 2005, more than 10,000 federal ADA lawsuits had been filed in the five states with the highest disabled populations; 7,188 of which were filed in California. Violating the ADA in California carries a minimum $4,000 penalty in addition to the plaintiffs legal fees. As of 2014, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 31 individuals made up at least 56 percent of federal disability lawsuits in California. As was mentioned during the second panel of today's hearing, California has 12 percent of the nation's disabled population, but accounts for over 40 percent of ADA lawsuits. Those figures and the real life toll it takes on small business owners, are why I introduced this legislation to allow for a ``fix-it'' period. However, it is clear that this is not just a major problem in California. The introduction, in November 2015, of similar legislation by the gentleman from Texas, Representative Ted Poe, shows just that. His legislation authorizes a training and education component for the affected community and Certified Access Specialists, which I would welcome and embrace as an amendment to my bill. This is also a bipartisan issue supported by states. I was pleased to see that California SB 269 passed unanimously in the State Assembly and Senate, and was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on May 10th, 2016. SB 269 was authored by a friend of mine, Democratic State Senator, Gen. Richard Roth. The legislation is similar to the ACCESS Act in that it allows businesses to take immediate steps to become accessible by providing them with 120 days, from receipt of a Certified Access Specialist report, to resolve any identified violations without being subject to litigation costs or statutory penalties. I worry that with California acting to curb these lawsuits, some of these serial litigants will try their trade in other states. Without question, the ACCESS Act will ensure that the ADA is used for its true purpose of guaranteed accessibility to public accommodations for all Americans while eliminating abusive, costly and unnecessary lawsuits for small business owners. It is more important than ever that the House of Representatives act to move this vital piece of legislation. ____________________",package_114_17.csv,5710,5710,5777,"[congressional record volume 162, number 80 (thursday, may 19, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e751] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] in support of h.r. 241, the access act ______ hon. ken calvert of california in the house of representatives thursday, may 19, 2016 mr. calvert. mr. speaker, i was pleased to have had the opportunity to testify today at the u.s. house judiciary committee, subcommittee on constitution and civil justice hearing, ``examining legislation to promote the effective enforcement of the ada's public accommodation provisions.'' as you know, the americans with disabilities act is undoubtedly one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation. we can all agree that providing all americans with access to public accommodations is an invaluable legislative objective. the purpose of the ada is to ensure access for the disabled to public accommodation and provide appropriate remedial action for those who have suffered harm as a result of noncompliance. although there are times when litigation by harmed individuals is necessary, there are an increasing number of lawsuits brought under the ada that are based upon a desire to achieve financial settlements rather than to achieve the appropriate modifications for access. these lawsuits filed by serial litigants, often referred to as ``drive-by lawsuits,'' place exorbitant legal fees on small businesses, and often times business owners are unaware of the specific nature of the allegations brought against them. in early 2011, frivolous ada lawsuits against small businesses reached an all-time high throughout california, and as a result, my good friend and colleague, former congressman dan lungren (r-ca), championed the issue and introduced the original access act (h.r. 3356) in the 112th congress. i was pleased to have been afforded the opportunity to take over the legislation for reintroduction beginning in the 113th congress. in january 2015, i reintroduced the legislation as h.r. 241, the access act (ada compliance for customer entry to stores and services). h.r. 241 is a cost-free and commonsense piece of legislation that would alleviate the financial burden small businesses are facing, while still fulfilling the purpose of the ada. any person aggrieved by a violation of the ada would provide the owner or operator with a written notice of the violation, specific enough to allow such owner or operator to identify the barrier to their access. within 60 days the owner or operator would be required to provide the aggrieved person with a description outlining improvements that would be made to address the barrier. the owner or operator would then have 120 days to make the improvement. the failure to meet any of these conditions would allow the lawsuit to go forward. i think we can all agree that we must ensure that individuals with disabilities are afforded the same access and opportunities as those without disabilities. frivolous lawsuits do not accomplish this goal. allowing small business owners and cities alike to fix ada violations within 120 days, rather than waiting for lengthy legal battles to play out, is a more thoughtful, timely, and reasonable approach. while the ada is a national law, california has become ground zero for ada violation lawsuits. in fact, california is home to more federal disability lawsuits than the next four states combined. a 2014 report determined that since 2005, more than 10,000 federal ada lawsuits had been filed in the five states with the highest disabled populations;

TERRI A. SEWELL of alabama in the house of representatives Thursday, May 19, 2016 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to acknowledge the Freedom Rides Museum in Montgomery, Alabama in its commemoration of the 55th anniversary of the Freedom Riders--the brave civil rights activists who peacefully fought against the unconstitutional public transportation segregation in the deep South in 1961. On May 14, 1961, Freedom Riders arrived in Anniston, Alabama on a Greyhound bus. They were met by an angry mob of nearly 200 white people who surrounded the bus and caused the driver to pass the bus stop. They were followed by the angry mob until the bus tires blew out which is when a bomb was thrown into the bus filled with peaceful civil rights activists. Barely escaping with their lives, the Freedom Riders watched the bus burst into flames and were then brutally beaten by members of the surrounding mob. A second bus traveled to Birmingham, Alabama. Those Freedom Riders were also met by angry mobs and were savagely beaten, some by metal pipes. The Birmingham Public Safety Commissioner at the time stated that he knew the Freedom Riders would be met with violence but posted no police protection because it was a holiday--Mother's Day. On May 20, 1961, it was the Montgomery, Alabama city line where the Govenor-appointed Highway Patrol abandoned the Freedom Riders they were charged to escort into the city. Their nonviolence was met with organized brutality of the worst kind. At the historic Montgomery Greyhound Station, the Freedom Riders were attacked as they exited by Jim Crow enthusiasts, beaten within inches of their lives by bats and iron pipes. Many riders were left for dead in the streets. Ambulances refused to transport the wounded to hospitals. Some members of the community stepped in, and tried to rescue the lives of those who dared challenge the unconstitutional Jim Crow laws of the South. It is my great honor to represent the 7th Congressional District--an area that is rich with the history of the young activists who defied systemic oppression, fought for the rights of others and asked for nothing except recognition as humans in return. These individuals continue to inspire me and the work I do day after day. In commemoration of the 55th anniversary, I want to recognize the Freedom Riders who risked their reputations and lives for the humanity of others. This diverse group of young people believed in persistence for obtaining equality and justice for all people and inspired millions to take a stand for their own beliefs of equity. The Freedom Riders made a daring choice in 1961--to fight against segregation and oppression in an innovative way that changed the course of American history forever. The valiant efforts of Freedom Riders such as Charles Person, William Harbour, Catherine Burks-Brooks, Bernard Lafayette, Jr., Ernest ``Rip'' Patton, Jr., Kwame Leo Lillard, Frances Wilson Canty, Allen Cason Jr., David Dennis, Larry Hunter, Alphonso Petway, Kredelle Petway, Betty Daniels Rosemond, Mary Jean Smith, Doratha Smith-Simmons, Willie Thomas, Jean Thompson, Joan C. Browning and Etta Simpson Ray led the charge to the ultimate desegregation of the bus system in Montgomery and the unification of a people to continue to fight for their rights. The Freedom Rides Museum in Montgomery, AL serves as a strong cornerstone in the narrative of the role of Alabama in the Civil Rights Movement. I want to thank the Alabama Historical Commission and its director Lisa Jones for their role in safeguarding Alabama's historic buildings and sites such as the Freedom Rides Museum. A special thanks to the leadership of Museum director Dorothy Walker and the amazing supporting staff members of the Freedom Rides Museum for their efforts in honoring the past and preserving the present for future generations to learn. The Freedom Rides Museum could not have been what it is without support from community members as well such as Judge Myron Thompson who helped save the building that is now the Museum as well as Johnnie Carr, former President of the Montgomery Improvement Association for all of her support as well as Louretta Wimberly of the Black Heritage Council. A special thanks to historian Dr. J. Mills Thornton who played a pivotal role in the creation of the Museum. The Freedom Riders are quintessential examples of how change can happen when we work together and fearlessly stand for what is right. I give us all the charge to--like the Freedom Riders, continue to battle against inequality and stand strong by our great nation's principles of democracy, liberty and justice for all. I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the 55th Anniversary of the Freedom Riders who in the summer of 1961 dared to make a difference and forever changed America for the better. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E752] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE HONORING THE 55TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FREEDOM RIDERS WHO BRAZENLY DESEGREGATED INTERSTATE TRAVEL ______ HON.

It is my great honor to represent the 7th Congressional District--an area that is rich with the history of the young activists who defied systemic oppression, fought for the rights of others and asked for nothing except recognition as humans in return. These individuals continue to inspire me and the work I do day after day. In commemoration of the 55th anniversary, I want to recognize the Freedom Riders who risked their reputations and lives for the humanity of others. This diverse group of young people believed in persistence for obtaining equality and justice for all people and inspired millions to take a stand for their own beliefs of equity. The Freedom Riders made a daring choice in 1961--to fight against segregation and oppression in an innovative way that changed the course of American history forever. The valiant efforts of Freedom Riders such as Charles Person, William Harbour, Catherine Burks-Brooks, Bernard Lafayette, Jr., Ernest ``Rip'' Patton, Jr., Kwame Leo Lillard, Frances Wilson Canty, Allen Cason Jr., David Dennis, Larry Hunter, Alphonso Petway, Kredelle Petway, Betty Daniels Rosemond, Mary Jean Smith, Doratha Smith-Simmons, Willie Thomas, Jean Thompson, Joan C. Browning and Etta Simpson Ray led the charge to the ultimate desegregation of the bus system in Montgomery and the unification of a people to continue to fight for their rights. The Freedom Rides Museum in Montgomery, AL serves as a strong cornerstone in the narrative of the role of Alabama in the Civil Rights Movement. I want to thank the Alabama Historical Commission and its director Lisa Jones for their role in safeguarding Alabama's historic buildings and sites such as the Freedom Rides Museum. A special thanks to the leadership of Museum director Dorothy Walker and the amazing supporting staff members of the Freedom Rides Museum for their efforts in honoring the past and preserving the present for future generations to learn. The Freedom Rides Museum could not have been what it is without support from community members as well such as Judge Myron Thompson who helped save the building that is now the Museum as well as Johnnie Carr, former President of the Montgomery Improvement Association for all of her support as well as Louretta Wimberly of the Black Heritage Council. A special thanks to historian Dr. J. Mills Thornton who played a pivotal role in the creation of the Museum. The Freedom Riders are quintessential examples of how change can happen when we work together and fearlessly stand for what is right. I give us all the charge to--like the Freedom Riders, continue to battle against inequality and stand strong by our great nation's principles of democracy, liberty and justice for all. I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the 55th Anniversary of the Freedom Riders who in the summer of 1961 dared to make a difference and forever changed America for the better.

in the house of representatives thursday, may 19, 2016 ms. sewell of alabama. mr. speaker, today i rise to acknowledge the freedom rides museum in montgomery, alabama in its commemoration of the 55th anniversary of the freedom riders--the brave civil rights activists who peacefully fought against the unconstitutional public transportation segregation in the deep south in 1961. on may 14, 1961, freedom riders arrived in anniston, alabama on a greyhound bus. they were met by an angry mob of nearly 200 white people who surrounded the bus and caused the driver to pass the bus stop. they were followed by the angry mob until the bus tires blew out which is when a bomb was thrown into the bus filled with peaceful civil rights activists. barely escaping with their lives, the freedom riders watched the bus burst into flames and were then brutally beaten by members of the surrounding mob. a second bus traveled to birmingham, alabama. those freedom riders were also met by angry mobs and were savagely beaten, some by metal pipes. the birmingham public safety commissioner at the time stated that he knew the freedom riders would be met with violence but posted no police protection because it was a holiday--mother's day. on may 20, 1961, it was the montgomery, alabama city line where the govenor-appointed highway patrol abandoned the freedom riders they were charged to escort into the city. their nonviolence was met with organized brutality of the worst kind. at the historic montgomery greyhound station, the freedom riders were attacked as they exited by jim crow enthusiasts, beaten within inches of their lives by bats and iron pipes. many riders were left for dead in the streets. ambulances refused to transport the wounded to hospitals. some members of the community stepped in, and tried to rescue the lives of those who dared challenge the unconstitutional jim crow laws of the south. it is my great honor to represent the 7th congressional district--an area that is rich with the history of the young activists who defied systemic oppression, fought for the rights of others and asked for nothing except recognition as humans in return. these

JOHN B. LARSON of connecticut in the house of representatives Thursday, May 19, 2016 Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following. Ralph Nader is a resident of Connecticut's First District, and has long been a champion for social justice, as well as a crusading consumer advocate who has had a lasting impact on consumer rights and the American political milieu. Ralph Nader Presents--Breaking Through Power: A Historic Civic Mobilization Celebrating the 50th anniversary year of Ralph Nader's book Unsafe at Any Speed, the Center for Study of Responsive Law announces four days of civic mobilization at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. on May 23, 24, 25 and 26, 2016. Unsafe at Any Speed unleashed fresh energies and sparked the creation of numerous advocacy organizations leading to major consumer, environmental and worker safety protections. The theme of this citizen mobilization will be elaborating ways to break through power to secure long-overdue democratic solutions made possible by a new muscular civic nexus between local communities and Washington, D.C. On these four days, speakers will present innovative ideas and strategies designed to take existing civic groups to higher levels of effectiveness. The participants will be asked to support the creation of several new organizations. One such group will work to open up the commercial media, which use the public airwaves free of charge, to serious content. Another will facilitate action by retired military, national security and diplomatic officials who want to deter unconstitutional and unlawful plunges into wars that lead to calamitous and costly blowbacks. This ``Civic Mobilization'' will involve thousands of people at Constitution Hall and around the country and connect long-available knowledge to long-neglected action for the necessities and aspirations of people from all backgrounds. Many of the presentations will feature reforms and redirections for the common good enjoy Left/Right support. Breaking Through Power: How it's Done--May 23, 2016 will feature presentations by seventeen citizen advocacy groups. Over decades these activists have produced amazing accomplishments against powerful odds. These civic leaders will demonstrate how, with modest budgets and stamina, they have improved the health, safety and economic well-being of the people and focused public opinion onto decision-makers and opponents. Through greater visibility, broader support [[Page E753]] and wider emulation, they will present their future missions and show that it can be ``easier than we think'' to make major changes. For the first time ever, this diverse group of fighters for justice will be assembled together on stage at Constitution Hall and show that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts when fighting for a broader democratic society. The presenters will appraise what levels of citizen organization is necessary to fulfill these broadly-desired missions. Breaking Through Power: The Media--May 24, 2016, brings together also for the first time a large gathering of authors, documentary filmmakers, reporters, columnists, musicians, poets and editorial cartoonists. All of these presenters have documented or depicted entrenched wrongdoing by the corporate state or ``crony capitalism''--the cruel impacts of corporate crimes and abuses, the absence of governmental law enforcement, and the harmful effects of concentrated corporate power. The speakers all seek wider audiences for their works: more readers, viewers and listeners. Unfortunately the mass media barons prefer to wallow in incessant advertising, hedonistic entertainment, sports and mind-numbing redundancy. The result is what many observers see as the stupefaction of human intelligence. A major purpose of Day Two is the creation of a ``Voices'' advocacy organization that puts forces in motion to inject serious programming into the over-the-air and cable networks under a revitalized Communications Act of 1934 and generally champion a greater life of the mind on all media. Breaking Through Power: War--May 25, 2016 is dedicated to enhancing the waging of peace over the waging of war. We will assemble leading scholars having military and national security backgrounds, veterans groups such as Veterans for Peace, and long-time peace advocacy associations, to explain how peace is more powerful than war. The speakers will address the horrors of war, its huge costs here and abroad to innocents and the weakening blowbacks of Empire amidst a collapse of constitutional and international law. One outcome of this day will be the establishment of a Secretariat comprised of current and former top-level military, national security and diplomatic officials who have spoken truth to reckless power. If organized for quick responses, their credibility, experience and wisdom can resist and prevent the kind of prevaricating pressures and unilateral policies that drove the unlawful destruction of Iraq, Libya and beyond. Breaking Through Power: Congress--May 26, 2016 will unveil a new Civic Agenda to be advanced by engaged and enraged citizens in each Congressional district. The Civic Agenda includes recognized necessities ignored by Congress for decades. The planks of this Civic Agenda will be presented by nationally-recognized advocates--a veritable brain trust for the well-being of present and future generations. Each speaker will present the substance of each demand, which will be conveyed to their members of Congress via organized ``Citizen Summons'' in each Congressional District. Revitalizing the people to assert their sovereignty under our Constitution is critical to the kind of government, economy, environment and culture that will fulfill human possibilities and respect posterity.

These civic leaders will demonstrate how, with modest budgets and stamina, they have improved the health, safety and economic well-being of the people and focused public opinion onto decision-makers and opponents. Through greater visibility, broader support [[Page E753]] and wider emulation, they will present their future missions and show that it can be ``easier than we think'' to make major changes. For the first time ever, this diverse group of fighters for justice will be assembled together on stage at Constitution Hall and show that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts when fighting for a broader democratic society. The presenters will appraise what levels of citizen organization is necessary to fulfill these broadly-desired missions. Breaking Through Power: The Media--May 24, 2016, brings together also for the first time a large gathering of authors, documentary filmmakers, reporters, columnists, musicians, poets and editorial cartoonists. All of these presenters have documented or depicted entrenched wrongdoing by the corporate state or ``crony capitalism''--the cruel impacts of corporate crimes and abuses, the absence of governmental law enforcement, and the harmful effects of concentrated corporate power. The speakers all seek wider audiences for their works: more readers, viewers and listeners. Unfortunately the mass media barons prefer to wallow in incessant advertising, hedonistic entertainment, sports and mind-numbing redundancy. The result is what many observers see as the stupefaction of human intelligence. A major purpose of Day Two is the creation of a ``Voices'' advocacy organization that puts forces in motion to inject serious programming into the over-the-air and cable networks under a revitalized Communications Act of 1934 and generally champion a greater life of the mind on all media. Breaking Through Power: War--May 25, 2016 is dedicated to enhancing the waging of peace over the waging of war. We will assemble leading scholars having military and national security backgrounds, veterans groups such as Veterans for Peace, and long-time peace advocacy associations, to explain how peace is more powerful than war. The speakers will address the horrors of war, its huge costs here and abroad to innocents and the weakening blowbacks of Empire amidst a collapse of constitutional and international law. One outcome of this day will be the establishment of a Secretariat comprised of current and former top-level military, national security and diplomatic officials who have spoken truth to reckless power. If organized for quick responses, their credibility, experience and wisdom can resist and prevent the kind of prevaricating pressures and unilateral policies that drove the unlawful destruction of Iraq, Libya and beyond. Breaking Through Power: Congress--May 26, 2016 will unveil a new Civic Agenda to be advanced by engaged and enraged citizens in each Congressional district. The Civic Agenda includes recognized necessities ignored by Congress for decades. The planks of this Civic Agenda will be presented by nationally-recognized advocates--a veritable brain trust for the well-being of present and future generations. Each speaker will present the substance of each demand, which will be conveyed to their members of Congress via organized ``Citizen Summons'' in each Congressional District. Revitalizing the people to assert their sovereignty under our Constitution is critical to the kind of government, economy, environment and culture that will fulfill human possibilities and respect posterity.

for study of responsive law announces four days of civic mobilization at constitution hall in washington, d.c. on may 23, 24, 25 and 26, 2016. unsafe at any speed unleashed fresh energies and sparked the creation of numerous advocacy organizations leading to major consumer, environmental and worker safety protections. the theme of this citizen mobilization will be elaborating ways to break through power to secure long-overdue democratic solutions made possible by a new muscular civic nexus between local communities and washington, d.c. on these four days, speakers will present innovative ideas and strategies designed to take existing civic groups to higher levels of effectiveness. the participants will be asked to support the creation of several new organizations. one such group will work

WILLIAM R. KEATING of massachusetts in the house of representatives Thursday, May 19, 2016 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Maureen Russell on her retirement after twenty-seven years of outstanding public service as a Victim Witness Advocate at the Norfolk District Attorney's Office. Maureen launched her extraordinary career in the Special Victims Unit, where she worked with severely traumatized victims of sexual abuse and assault. Through her strength of character and compassion, she provided victims and their families the tools necessary to navigate the complexities of the state court system, assist in prosecuting offenders, and, ultimately, begin to rebuild their lives. Maureen has most recently been serving her community as a Superior Court Advocate in the Norfolk Superior Court, where she advocates for families of victims of homicide and other serious crimes. Among numerous other families supported by Maureen is that of Joanna Mullin, a six-year-old tragically murdered by her cousin. As she has so often done, Maureen went above and beyond the call of duty in her advocacy for the Mullins, steadfastly supporting the family as they traversed the arduous criminal justice process. Having assisted the Mullins family through the aftermath of their tragedy and the processes of the court, she continues maintains a strong relationship with the family to this day. It is this dedication and passion that is exemplary of quality victim advocacy. Throughout her years of service, Maureen has never strayed from her commitment to providing each and every victim in her community the attention and care they deserve. Her experience in the criminal justice system and her professional and personal relationships with prosecutors, colleagues, law enforcement officers, and other professionals has allowed Maureen to smooth an otherwise turbulent, uncertain, and difficult process for victims and their families. Our community is deeply grateful to Maureen for having been a person to trust and a shoulder to lean on during these victims' most difficult times. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in honor of Maureen Russell, who embodies all of the best qualities of a Victim Advocate. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this distinguished public servant and in wishing her the best of luck in her future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E753] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF MAUREEN RUSSELL ______ HON.

STACEY E. PLASKETT of the virgin islands in the house of representatives Thursday, May 19, 2016 Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, last night, this Congress passed a bill to allocate funding for resources to fight the spread of the Zika virus. This funding, however, is woefully insufficient. H.R. 5243 provides less than one-third of the White House request sent to Congress earlier this year. Additionally, this bill also completely neglects the immediate needs of the territories of Puerto Rico and my home district of the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are both on the front line of this public health crisis. Of the 1200 confirmed cases in the United States, more than half have been reported in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. While the Administration requested about $256 million in health care assistance to the territories, H.R. 5243 bill provides no targeted funding to the U.S. Territories. The House bill also cuts the request for research and development of vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics by $132 million or 28.4 percent. The lack of funding for these public health activities will put hundreds of thousands of pregnant women at risk. The lifetime cost of treating a child with microcephaly is estimated to be more than $10 million--a cost that will only exacerbate the financial woes of the territories' public health apparatus. Mr. Speaker, every day this Congress debates whether or not to protect women and unborn children from this virus, more cases are being reported and confirmed. Just last week, the first U.S. case of Zika-related microcephaly was identified in a pregnancy in Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to continue toward funding the President's emergency request to fight the Zika virus. We need to eradicate this mosquito now. We cannot wait for June for more authorized funding. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E753] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PASSAGE OF H.R. 5243 ______ HON.

Delegates represent all 50 states plus Puerto Rico, and must have a minimum 3.5 GPA.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Thurgood Marshall High School track and field team for winning the University Interscholastic League (UlL) 5A state track championship for the second year in a row. The Marshall Buffalos were led to victory by their coach Lloyd Banks. Their overall score of 52 points outperformed the competition by a substantial 16 points. Junior sprinter Shamon Ehiemua helped lead his team to success by defending his state title in the 200-meter dash with a time of 20.62 seconds. In addition to Ehiemua's efforts, teammate John Isom placed fifth in the 400-meter dash with a time of 48.19 seconds. Teammates Cedarian Lynch, Ehiemua, Jarmaiz Whitaker and Isom were awarded a gold medal in the 4x100-meter relay with an astounding time of 40.13 seconds. Their win is even more impressive considering runner Jeremy Smith was recovering from a foot injury during the relay. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congressional District of Texas, congratulations again to the Fort Bend Marshall Track and Field Team for winning the 5A state track championship for the second time.

ALCEE L. HASTINGS of florida in the house of representatives Thursday, May 19, 2016 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Lantos Foundation's second Solidarity Sabbath, which highlights the deplorable human rights violations committed by the People's Republic of China against its citizens who simply wish to openly and sincerely practice their respective faiths. Many of us will attend worship services in the coming days and we will do so without fear of arrest, torture, or forced re-education. I hope that those of us attending services this weekend will take time to meditate and pray on the importance of religious freedom here at home and around the world. The human spirit is remarkably resilient. This resiliency is undoubtedly strengthened through religious faith and practice and cannot and will not be extinguished through the draconian state action we see taking place in China. Indeed, as I am sure the Chinese government is realizing, its draconian tactics to suppress and intimidate the religious faithful do not diminish the numbers of those seeking to practice their faith but rather multiplies their number exponentially. Sadly, there are myriad cases of people of faith being harassed, intimidated, and arrested today in China. Indeed, Protestant, Catholic, Tibetan Buddhist, Uyghur Muslim, Falun Gong, and other religious minorities face such a reality every day. A recent survey of religious intimidation in China noted that Chinese officials oversaw the demolition of over thirty churches, the removal of more than four hundred crosses from houses of worship, and the detention of over three hundred worshipers with half of these people suffering injuries sustained during their arrests. It should be noted that this paints a picture for just one province in China; there are many similar stories across China where those seeking to simply practice their respective faiths are consistently harassed, detained, and injured for exercising a basic human right. While we must certainly lend our support to the religious faithful in China as they strive to exercise their basic human right to worship where, when and what they so desire, we must also applaud and support the brave human rights lawyers in China who champion the rights of the religious faithful in the face of unthinkable intimidation as practiced by the Chinese government. These brave men and women have provided rule of law training to church members throughout China. Indeed, this past year these lawyers were able to conduct over one hundred trainings for over one hundred thousand religious practitioners. This has resulted in these practitioners filing important administrative lawsuits against the government in an effort to quell the Chinese government's acts of religious persecution. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Lantos Foundation for its inspired work to bring light to the plight of the religious faithful in China. I will this weekend, as I always have and will continue to do, stand in solidarity with my brothers and sisters of faith in China. Their right to practice their religion is a fundamental right and it must be protected. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E755] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE LANTOS FOUNDATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND JUSTICE'S SOLIDARITY SABBATH ______ HON.

The Boys & Girls Club of the Gulf Coast plays a vital role in shining a ray of hope into the lives of young people who may not see a bright future ahead of themselves. Originally named the Biloxi Boys Club, the organization began in 1966, with the help of the Biloxi Jaycees, to serve 15 young men. Today, there are over 1,700 registered members, five locations, and a daily attendance of approximately 800 young men and women of the Gulf Coast region. It is our responsibility, as a community, to invest in the lives of our future leaders. The Boys & Girls Club of the Gulf Coast strives to develop productive, responsible, and caring citizens. The organization leads our community's efforts to improve academic success, healthy lifestyles, and good character in our young men and women. This is accomplished by offering our young people a safe and supportive place to go and by providing them with quality programs to teach responsibility, positive character development, sports, and academic progress, among other important aspects of leadership. The Boys & Girls Club of the Gulf Coast is a valuable asset for our Coast children. Once again, I commend the Boys & Girls Club of the Gulf Coast as they mark the 50th anniversary of improving young lives along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E755] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BOYS & GIRLS CLUB OF THE MS GULF COAST 50TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

JOE COURTNEY of connecticut in the house of representatives Thursday, May 19, 2016 Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished military service of Army Sergeant Micah Welintukonis of Coventry, Connecticut who will retire on May 19, 2016 after 16 years and 5 months of active duty. Sgt Welintukonis' record reads like a history book of U.S. military action over the last [[Page E756]] 22 years. He served in Kosovo during his first stint of active duty in the 1990s. Later, as a member of the Connecticut National Guard he deployed to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom, then served in Afghanistan where he was severely injured by a suicide bomb attack in 2012. During that time, he rose through the ranks to Sergeant and accumulated an impressive array of awards and medals, including the Purple Heart, Army Commendation with Valor, Combat Medic Badge, Expert Infantry Badge, Commanding Generals Certificate of Merit, and the Coast Guard and United States Marine Corps Certificates of Appreciation. At the time of his injury, he was a medic, certified at the highest levels and performed many life-saving missions with skill and care for the men and women he served with. The first time I met Sgt. Welintukonis was under extraordinary circumstances. He had just arrived at Walter Reed Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland where he had flown in from Landstuhl Hospital in Germany, still suffering in agonizing pain from his life threatening abdominal injury. His amazing wife, Camilla, was at his bedside comforting him, but it was clear that his condition was very critical. Even though he was not aware of my presence, I had the opportunity to witness his incredible inner strength and ferocious will to live that carried him through that dark hour and a long and difficult recovery. With the support of his wife and family, Micah is healthy and ready to start a new chapter of his life. Wherever he and his family go, one thing is sure. Micah will be a passionate advocate for American veterans and for a strong national defense. I know that because my email inbox has been bursting with messages, articles, and suggestions--sometimes sent in the middle of the night--about improving services for those who wear the uniform of our country. Today, he is active in veterans' service organizations such as the Connecticut American Legion, Special Operations Wounded Warriors, and as the Director of InTheLineOfDuty, a volunteer-run charity for First Responders. In addition to that formal involvement he has organized fund raiser walk-a-thons, school visits, and national veterans media events to generate funds and awareness of the challenges America's veterans, in particular wounded veterans, confront every day. America has been, and still is, lucky to have the tenacious, spirited, (sometimes a little grouchy) and high-quality contributions of Sgt. Micah Welintukonis over the last 22 years. Please join me in thanking him, his wife Camilla, and their children for all they have done for our nation and wish them well in all their future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 80 (Thursday, May 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E755-E756] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING U.S. ARMY SERGEANT MICAH WELINTUKONIS UPON HIS RETIREMENT ______ HON.

Dickinson of Council Bluffs, Iowa for achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. Andrew is a member of Boy Scout Troop 23. Troop 23 has been associated with Our Savior's Lutheran Church in Council Bluffs for over 50 years. The Eagle Scout designation is the highest advancement rank in scouting. Approximately 2 percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout Award. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards that have been well-maintained over the past century. To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass specific tests that are organized by requirements and merit badges, as well as completing an Eagle Scout Project to benefit the community. For Andrew's Eagle Scout Project he provided 22 slab-topped benches for a pit area at Camp of Good Shepherd in Louisville, Nebraska. Andrew assisted in the milling of the slabs and coordinated the construction with members of several Webelos Scout packs. The work ethic Andrew has shown in his Eagle Scout Project and every other project leading up to his Eagle Scout rank speaks volumes about his commitment to serving a cause greater than himself and assisting his community. Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication, and perseverance.
