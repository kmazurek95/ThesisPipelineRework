CYNTHIA M. LUMMIS of wyoming in the house of representatives Friday, May 27, 2016 Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Wyoming Conference of Building Officials, to recognize the leadership of the Wyoming Chapter of the International Code Council (ICC) that develops and publishes the model building, safety and energy efficiency model codes used in my home state of Wyoming, and each of the other 49 states. Confidence in building safety is achieved through the devotion of vigilant guardians--building safety and fire prevention officials, architects, engineers, builders, tradespeople, laborers and others in the construction industry who work year-round to ensure the safe construction of the buildings in which we live and work. Thirty-one people from eighteen cities across the state of Wyoming attended the very first meeting of the newly formed Wyoming Association of Building Officials on January 23, 1976 in Gillette, Wyoming. The following inaugural officers were elected at that first meeting in Gillette: President Ralph Rock, Building Inspector, Gillette, WY; Vice President Joe Keefer, Building Inspector, Douglas, WY; Secretary- Treasurer Thomas W. Chambers, Cody, WY; Director R.G. Patton, Building Inspector, Cody, WY; and J.J. Ireland, Building Inspector, Cheyenne, WY. Over the past forty years the Wyoming Conference of Building Officials has provided continuing education for design professionals, fire service and the public. It has provided more than $18,000 in scholarships to Wyoming residents to attend the International Code Council's Annual Conference to learn more on the latest building standards and codes. And, it has published numerous articles in the Building Safety Journal. The current Board of the Wyoming Conference of Building officials-- President Keith Bowar of Campbell County, WY; Vice President Lyle Murdock of Wright, WY; Treasurer Billy Nunn of Jackson, WY; Director Matt Allred of Guernsey, WY; Director Ken Rogers of Gillette, WY; and Past President Bruce Wilson of Cheyenne, WY, currently represent 90 members across 48 jurisdictions. I would like to thank the thousands of men and women who work every day to make sure our country's buildings comply with the most updated building and fire safety codes. And I would like to especially thank those hard working members of the Wyoming Conference of Building Officials, celebrating their 40th anniversary of service to the citizens of the great state of Wyoming. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 85 (Friday, May 27, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E813] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WYOMING CONFERENCE OF BUILDING OFFICIALS ______ HON.

As the headline reads in the local paper, ``Talk about major girl power.'' At last count, these young ladies have received more than ``$2.85 million in scholarship offers for 2016.'' The Birmingham City School System also had two Gates Millennium Scholars this year including Ramsay High School's Valedictorian, Maya Quinn. The Class of 2016 Valedictorians includes: Parker High School's Alejandrina Bravo; Woodlawn High School's Michelle Thomas; Huffman High School's Kierra Hutchins; Jackson-Olin High School's Alana Bennett; Ramsay High School's Maya Quinn; and Carver High School's Jamerial Gardner and Ariana Robinson. Carver High School was unique in that they had two students tie for valedictorian this year. Mr. Speaker, while most of the communities in my district are greatly underserved, we continuously see what is possible from our citizens with a little bit of resources and whole bunch of hard work. We know that when women succeed, America succeeds. And these young women are on the path to bright futures, and to giving back in hopefully meaningful ways to our communities, and should be commended for their outstanding achievements. I am sure they will look back proudly on this accomplishment as they blaze their respective paths in life.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the lifelong service and success of Sandra Thorstenson, the Superintendent of Whittier Union School District, in my Congressional District in California. You could say that the Whittier Union School District is part of Sandra's DNA. After moving to Whittier at the age of five, Sandy went on to graduate from Whittier High School, attended Whittier College, and from there, launched a 39-year career as a teacher, principal, and Superintendent of the district. While I think Sandy's lifelong dedication to educating young people is reason enough to celebrate, I would be remiss not to mention the success that has made her a leader in improving education for low- income students. Under her leadership, Whittier Union's motto has been ``demographics do not determine destiny.'' The results of this attitude are clear. In a district with nearly 70 percent economically- disadvantaged students, Whittier Union sports a 97 percent graduation rate and sends 95 percent of its students on for a higher education. Ms. Thorstenson embodies the kind of public servant and leader we need more of in education, someone who is unwilling to settle for anything less than success for every student in her district. It is in that spirit that, on behalf of all the families who've benefitted from her service, I wish Sandra a happy retirement and thank her for inspiring generations of students in the Whittier Union School District. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 85 (Friday, May 27, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E814] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO SANDRA THORSTENSON _____ HON.

Mr. Pearson was born and raised in Waco, Texas where he attended Richfield High School. He later graduated Summa Cum Laude from Texas State University-San Marcos and received a Master's Degree from the University of Texas at San Antonio in Public Administration where he was a Recognized Scholar. Mr. Pearson also holds a Certified Public Manager's Certification from the William P Hobby Center for Public Service at Texas State University. In 2000, Mr. Pearson began working for the San Antonio Water System, where he was involved in the implementation of a revolutionary water recycling system that provides over 35,000 acre feet of water for non- potable uses throughout San Antonio. The water recycling program remains the largest in the country to date. The Water Reuse Foundation recognized Mr. Pearson for his contributions to water conservation efforts in 2005. Additionally, Mr. Pearson advised on the design of a customer service and site certification manual for the Water Reuse Foundation, and worked on the Cibolo Canyons Professional Golfers' Association Project for the San Antonio Water System. Mr. Pearson began his career in public service in 2008 when he was named Assistant City Manager for the City of Cibolo. As Assistant City Manager, he oversaw the implementation of a capital improvement project that allowed the city to build a new police and fire Station, a public park, and to reconstruct the city's Main Street. In 2012, Mr. Pearson was named City Manager for the City of Pleasanton; a position through which he contributed to the city's growth, development, and prosperity. He oversaw the development and implementation of a multifaceted city master plan, a parks master plan, and contributed to the design and construction of a civic center, library, and the Freedom Center Project. Mr. Pearson has done an extraordinary job of bringing a vision of long term progress in every community he has worked in. In addition to his impressive career in public service and municipal development, Mr. Pearson is a devoted father and grandfather.

It is not doing what you came here to do, out of timidity and spinelessness. The antidote is to take full responsibility for yourself--for the time you take up and the space you occupy. If you don't know what you're here to do, then just do some good.''--Maya Angelou Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance and recognition of the life of Sarid Chaim Shahdaiah, and Quincy Gemal Williams two very accomplished young men who tragically lost their lives in a car accident on December 3, 2014. Many parents, teachers, neighbors and young people hope to find the kindness and dedication that these two young men exhibited regularly as sons, students, friends and incredibly well-rounded, commendable young men. The accomplishment these young men earned far exceed the highest expectations of any proud parent or community member in awe of exceptional young leaders in today's America. I understand as well, that in recognition and honor of his pursuit of excellence, several highly esteemed universities expressed interest in Mr. Shahdaiah, hoping that he would join their respected student bodies. [[Page E814]] I was thoroughly impressed to learn that, through his dedication to his studies; Mr. Shahdaiah earned a grade point average of 3.6 and was inducted into the National Society of High School Scholars. As a highly accomplished student-athlete, he served the U.S.A. International Football Team as Captain, Team Ambassador and starting linebacker, in addition to exalting fervent school pride, during his junior year as a highly valued teammate of the Dekaney Wildcats, his high school varsity track and football teams. Expanding the bounds of his requisite studies, he explored his curiosities for the world of science becoming a member of the Texas High School Engineering Career and Technology Council. I join his family and many admirers in genuinely celebrating Mr. Shahdaiah's life and outstanding contributions. Quincy was one of the world's best comedians; he had the ability to make anyone who came into contact with him laugh. All who knew Mr. Williams admired his prowess for presentation. Deemed one of the ``Sharpest'' brothers you'd meet. Mr. Williams was affectionately called by his parents a ``Junior''; and was one of the most outgoing, lovable kids that a parent could ever want. Although young in body Mr. Williams was old in song; he was a profound lover of any and all Motown Performers and would listen to them regularly. While at Andy Dekaney High school Quincy became branded as the ``Soul Brother'' of the football team. These two young men cultivated their efforts, positioning themselves to successfully matriculate in May of 2016; and, but for their ill- fated passing, would by all accounts have celebrated their well- deserved accomplishments with their families as a milestone achievement in their young lives. While I have no doubt they would have realized countless ambitions, we are left to accept that their dreams of immeasurable magnitude now rest with them. These young men worked hard. I cannot think of a more solemn manner of celebrating their life than to honor their efforts by bestowing upon their families recognition of the achievement for which they so ardently strode. In the words of Booker T. Washington ``Character is power''. Character truly is power and that power was present in the lives of these prolific young men. Yes, their lives were cut short, but with what time they did have they effectively made the best of it. Heaven has truly gained a dynamic pair of angels, while young Mr. Shahdaiah's and Mr. Williams families lost their most promising stars.

MARCY KAPTUR of ohio in the house of representatives Friday, May 27, 2016 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Susan J. Tolchin, someone who I had the privilege to work with and who I had long admired for her curiosity, her judgment, and her concern for others. An ardent feminist, who along with her husband Marty, brought attention to the plight of middle-class working women, a class of Americans often overlooked and rarely chronicled, Susan and Marty authored several books together, all of which highlighted the mechanisms that the Tolchin's considered ``occupational hazards of democracy.'' As an author and a professor, Susan focused on and scrutinized political patronage and its many pitfalls, and was one of the first political scientists to identify growing voter disenchantment and disillusion with their government. She wisely concluded that these concerns were deeply rooted in the women's and worker's rights issues, largely discounted and ignored by policymakers, but which she sought to highlight through her teaching and writings. In her seminal and sage work on political patronage, Susan redefined political patronage as that which ``includes the vast range of favors awarded by constantly expanding governments.'' Likewise, her work on evolving voter anger was cutting-edge analysis, far ahead of her peers. For those who had the fortune to know her, Susan was an engaging and charming conversationalist, with a natural curiosity and ability to learn from others. She was always learning and seeking new ideas, and applying this knowledge to her scholarship in the classroom and in her writings in political journals, magazines and books. Susan's legacy of scholarship has provided those of us who also champion women's and laborers' rights with a critical knowledge base. Her work was inspirational, and insightful, and helped me and many others to understand trends and the undercurrents that caused them which others might have missed. Susan was not only dedicated to struggles of the working, middle- class women, but also to her family, whom she loved dearly. She and her husband Martin worked closely together for many decades, authoring many books. She adored her daughter Karen, also a professor, and their charming grandson, Charlie. They were quite a team, Susan and Marty, always joyful and supportive of each other. Those who were fortunate to have known and loved Susan, or who had followed her work, will miss her terribly. Her passion was an inspiration for many, and one can only hope that her passing will not be the last chapter of her story, but that she will continue to inspire countless others. She certainly inspired me. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 85 (Friday, May 27, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E815] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF SUSAN TOLCHIN _____ HON.

Susan's legacy of scholarship has provided those of us who also champion women's and laborers' rights with a critical knowledge base. Her work was inspirational, and insightful, and helped me and many others to understand trends and the undercurrents that caused them which others might have missed. Susan was not only dedicated to struggles of the working, middle- class women, but also to her family, whom she loved dearly. She and her husband Martin worked closely together for many decades, authoring many books. She adored her daughter Karen, also a professor, and their charming grandson, Charlie. They were quite a team, Susan and Marty, always joyful and supportive of each other. Those who were fortunate to have known and loved Susan, or who had followed her work, will miss her terribly. Her passion was an inspiration for many, and one can only hope that her passing will not be the last chapter of her story, but that she will continue to inspire countless others. She certainly inspired me. ____________________",package_114_269.csv,2958,2958,3023,"[congressional record volume 162, number 85 (friday, may 27, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e815] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] remembering the life of susan tolchin _____ hon. marcy kaptur of ohio in the house of representatives friday, may 27, 2016 ms. kaptur. mr. speaker, i rise today to remember the life of susan j. tolchin, someone who i had the privilege to work with and who i had long admired for her curiosity, her judgment, and her concern for others. an ardent feminist, who along with her husband marty, brought attention to the plight of middle-class working women, a class of americans often overlooked and rarely chronicled, susan and marty authored several books together, all of which highlighted the mechanisms that the tolchin's considered ``occupational hazards of democracy.'' as an author and a professor, susan focused on and scrutinized political patronage and its many pitfalls, and was one of the first political scientists to identify growing voter disenchantment and disillusion with their government. she wisely concluded that these concerns were deeply rooted in the women's and worker's rights issues, largely discounted and ignored by policymakers, but which she sought to highlight through her teaching and writings. in her seminal and sage work on political patronage, susan redefined political patronage as that which ``includes the vast range of favors awarded by constantly expanding governments.'' likewise, her work on evolving voter anger was cutting-edge analysis, far ahead of her peers. for those who had the fortune to know her, susan was an engaging and charming conversationalist, with a natural curiosity and ability to learn from others. she was always learning and seeking new ideas, and applying this knowledge to her scholarship in the classroom and in her writings in political journals, magazines and books. susan's legacy of scholarship has provided those of us who also champion women's and laborers' rights with a critical knowledge base. her work was inspirational, and insightful, and helped me and many others to understand trends and the undercurrents that caused them which others might have missed. susan was not only dedicated to struggles of the working, middle- class women, but also to her family, whom she loved dearly. she and her husband martin worked closely together for many decades, authoring many books. she adored her daughter karen, also a professor, and their charming grandson, charlie. they were quite a team, susan and marty, always joyful and supportive of each other. those who were fortunate to have known and loved susan, or who had followed her work, will miss her terribly. her passion was an inspiration for many, and one can only hope that her passing will not be the last chapter of her story, but that she will continue to inspire countless others. she certainly inspired me. ____________________",2958
CREC-2016-05-27-pt1-PgE815-2,CREC-2016-05-27,114,MONTENEGRO SHOWS THE VIRTUE OF SELF-DETERMINATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 85 (Friday, May 27, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E815] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MONTENEGRO SHOWS THE VIRTUE OF SELF-DETERMINATION _____ HON. DANA ROHRABACHER of california in the house of representatives Friday, May 27, 2016 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, the right of self-determination is today manifested by unhappy ethnic and national groups in almost every corner of the world--Scotland, Catalonia, Baluchistan, Biafra, or Kashmir. Current national establishments, as well as international organizations and alliances, however, fear changing the map, terrified by any proposal to dissolve the legal, political, and economic bonds between peoples that creates two countries where there is now one. Self-determination and secession are, in the global establishment's mind, synonymous with instability, chaos and bloodshed. And, yes, that is what has happened all too often when a dominant ethnic group has refused to recognize rights of a minority to a vote on sticking with the status quo or governing themselves in a new or different country. But chaos need not be the outcome of people exercising their right of self-determination. Ten years ago this week, voters in Montenegro went to the polls in a referendum that posed the question, do you want Montenegro to be an independent state? When the votes were counted, 55.5 percent chose to peacefully dissolve their union with Serbia. Shortly thereafter, all five members of the United Nations Security Council recognized the newest country in the world. In a region not known for a peaceful resolution of disputes, the peoples of Serbia and Montenegro have written a praiseworthy chapter in the history of democratic government and self-determination. So what made it work so well this time? First and foremost, credit needs to be given to the Serbian government that permitted this referendum to occur. By doing so, made force and violence unnecessary and even counterproductive in the cause of Montenegrin independence. Belgrade, which has made its share of bad decisions, should be praised for making the right decision--right for the people of Serbia and Montenegro. There are only a few examples of such an amiable separation. The Czech and Slovak split into two countries is certainly one example. We remember elections in Scotland and Quebec, where voters did not choose to be a new nation. Clearly it is better to let the future be determined by ballots, not bullets, and in such a democratic environment, fewer people will want to vote for a split. If a minority decides to go for it, it will not result in a far-reaching trauma and decades of dissolution and animosity. Today, for example, Montenegro is poised for a better future. It is advancing toward Euro-Atlantic integration, increasing its ability to fight organized crime and corruption, and strengthening its civil society and democratic structures. Yes, there are vexing problems, but with independence, the people of Montenegro know they themselves will determine if Montenegro is to be on the right track. With such a dynamic in play, there is every reason for confidence that problems will be solved and the building of a better country will get done. As the chairman of the Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats Subcommittee, I have followed the volatile situation in those areas that are under pressure from such nationalistic movements. Economic stagnation and corruption feed the desire for self-determination and continue to be the biggest hurdle to developing countries like Montenegro, even now when the people there are free to control their own destiny. Forging new standards for transparency and accountability should cut down and make all the difference in situations like this. Montenegro's success in achieving membership in the EU and NATO depends on it. The government of Montenegro now points to its macroeconomic predictability, educated workforce, and openness to incentivized tax structures to lure direct foreign investment and serve as fuel for economic progress. Their future is in their hands. Thus, they know they must act--or they lose. So after decades of being a backwater country, literally and figuratively, Montenegro is on the move. Stratex Group, for example, is now the largest American investor in Montenegro. The CEO was one of many Jewish families that fled Soviet Communism and settled in the United States. As Montenegro develops, more international and domestic entrepreneurs, like Stratex, can be expected to take advantage of opportunities in this beautiful, free and independent country, opportunities brought on by the triumph of self-determination, sidelining conflict and corruption. The more success stories there are in the wake of amicable separation, the more peaceful independent movements can be expected to emerge. New nations like Montenegro can be expected, and once in control of their own destiny, people in these new independent countries can be expected to prioritize critical reforms and educate their new generations about corruption, free enterprise, and democratic government in the 21st century. I congratulate Montenegro on ten years of independence, and recommend others look to its experience as an example of gaining freedom and prosperity through self-determination. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 85 (Friday, May 27, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E815] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MONTENEGRO SHOWS THE VIRTUE OF SELF-DETERMINATION _____ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Denise Jackson for her commitment as a volunteer for the George C. Yount Pioneer cemetery in Yountville, California. Ms. Jackson has been instrumental in maintaining the cemetery grounds and recording its long history. She took the initiative to become a volunteer grounds keeper a decade ago. With the support of her vineyard crew from her business, Colinas Farming Company, Ms. Jackson saw to it that the 16-acre cemetery stayed well-maintained. To enhance the historical records of the organization, Ms. Jackson began a four-year project to survey the graves of 949 people laid to rest at the cemetery dating back to 1848. She led a team of 20 research volunteers and later archived this information online for descendants to trace their family history in California. She also published her findings in ``Mapping the George C. Yount Pioneer Cemetery'' which she presented to the Napa Valley Genealogical Society. Ms. Jackson found the time to contribute to other community causes. As an extension of her decades of work as a registered dietitian, Ms. Jackson founded the Baby Nutrition Class at the Queen of the Valley Hospital and has a long history of supporting the American Heart Association where she currently serves as a board member. Ms. Jackson also chairs the Nutrition Committee of Napa County. Additionally, she helps employees of the George C. Yount Pioneer cemetery with medical insurance claims. Mr. Speaker, Denise Jackson has selflessly spent her time and energy preserving the history of the George C. Yount Pioneer cemetery and caring for the health and needs of others in her community.

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize and thank Mayor Wilson Kirby for his extraordinary leadership and service to the town of Berryville and its community. Mayor Kirby moved to Berryville sixteen years ago, where he has since faithfully served the town first as a member of the Town Council and later as Mayor. Though he was new to the area, he immediately began dedicating himself to bettering the town and the lives of its citizens. With over 45 years of experience in engineering and consulting, Mayor Kirby was able to bring a unique perspective to improving many of Berryville's projects. He spearheaded a number of projects such as a new wastewater treatment plant, the construction of the new Clarke County High School, and the maintenance of the town's secondary roads. These projects exemplify the hard work and time Mayor Kirby put into his town. His selfless desire to constantly improve Berryville never went unnoticed, least of all to his colleagues in the town government. He held office hours twice weekly to hear local concerns and other issues from Berryville citizens, always understanding that the citizens of the town were of the utmost importance. A believer in a hands-on approach to governing, Mayor Kirby has helped make Berryville a truly wonderful town to visit, live in, and enjoy. From celebrating one hundredth birthdays of town members to lighting the town Christmas tree, Mayor Kirby has been an integral part of Berryville for the last 16 years. Berryville will be sad to see him leave office, but his legacy will continue. Today, we honor and celebrate the contributions he has made to the town of Berryville and all its citizens.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 85 (Friday, May 27, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E816] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR WILSON KIRBY OF BERRYVILLE _____ HON.
