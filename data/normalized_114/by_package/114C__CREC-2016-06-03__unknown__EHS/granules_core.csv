BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Friday, June 3, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to honor the life of Robert Klancher. Mr. Klancher recently passed away at the age of 57 after battling cancer for almost two years. He leaves behind an incredible legacy as a community leader and friend to so many throughout the Commonwealth. His work over the years has not only helped change his home of Loudoun County, but also the lives of countless other in Virginia's 10th District. He was a leader in every sense of the word and his immense positive impact on those who knew him will be felt for years to come. Robert served on Loudoun County's Planning Commission since he was first appointed to the position in January of 2004. Over his twelve years with the commission, Robert served as both Chairman and Vice Chairman, where he helped provide more than 750 recommendations to the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors on issues concerning land development, comprehensive planning, future land use policies, and the Capital Improvements Program. His son, also named Robert, has continued on his father's legacy of distinguished government service by working in Prince William County government and now as a Legislative Aide to Supervisor Ron Meyer of the Broad Run District. Mr. Klancher's tenure on the Loudoun County Planning Commission coincided with one of the county's largest periods of growth. In 2004, Loudoun had a population of approximately 230,000 residents. Today, that number has grown to an estimated 373,000 residents. His work has contributed to many of the great sites and activities that residents in the community enjoy, such as the Stone Ridge community, Loudoun Valley Estates, Arcola Center, One Loudoun, Waterside and Lansdowne developments, as well as updates to Broadlands, Brambleton, Kirkpatrick Farms, and many others. Robert truly cared about his community, the depth of which is marked by the incredible legacy of involvement and positive change he has given us all. Robert served as a mentor to both coworkers and friends, while colleagues have noted that he ``exemplified the qualities of a community servant''. He will be missed by all those who had the pleasure of knowing him, both on a personal and professional level. Robert is survived by his beloved wife Janet, daughter Victoria Hickman, son Bobby and daughters Catherine and Jacqueline. He is also survived by his loving parents Bob and Olga Klancher, and his brother John. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the life of Robert Klancher. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 87 (Friday, June 3, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E819] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT KLANCHER ______ HON.

There is an old proverb that says, ``Better than a thousand days of diligent study is one day with a great teacher.'' Fortunately for the students of the Pennsbury School District they shared many days with a great teacher, Mrs. Fran Nitkin. Mrs. Nitkin was hired by Pennsbury in 1989 initially as a substitute teacher. She then served for many years as a teacher at Oxford Valley Elementary and had the opportunity to inspire young minds in elementary schools across the Pennsbury School District including Edgewood, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Quarry Hill elementary schools. In 2003, Mrs. Nitkin was appointed principal at Village Park Elementary. She then moved to Oxford Valley in 2006 and remained principal there until her death. Known by all for her high standards and dedication as a teacher and administrator, she was always ready to ``provide assistance and wise counsel.'' Oxford Valley Elementary School, a National School of Character, was built on the cornerstones of Cooperation, Respect, Responsibility, and Sportsmanship. Principal Fran Nitkin embodied these qualities and passed them along to her students every single day because she was a great teacher. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 87 (Friday, June 3, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E819] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND LIFE OF FRAN NITKIN ______ HON.

SAM GRAVES of missouri in the house of representatives Friday, June 3, 2016 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. C. Don Bateman, Corporate Fellow and Chief Engineer-Technologist for Flight Safety Systems and Technology at Honeywell Aerospace. As the man behind the first Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) and the revolutionary Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS), Mr. Bateman is a true champion of safety for the aviation industry. Don has received a long list of accolades, including receiving the U.S. Presidential Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2011. Bateman also is in the National Inventors Hall of Fame, an Aviation Path Finder in the Museum of Flight, and a Royal Aeronautical Society Fellow. He received Aviation Week's Laurel for IT/Electronics and its Award for Lifetime Achievement, and in 2014 picked up the Elmer A. Sperry Award for enhancing the art of transportation. Over his 60 year career in the aviation industry, Don's intense focus on identifying, understanding, and addressing aviation safety risks has led to some of the most successful safety solutions in aviation history. He holds over 50 U.S. and 90 foreign patents related to a wide variety of safety-related avionics including Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems, Heads-up Display systems, Speed Control/Auto Throttle Systems, Stall Warning Systems, Automatic Flight Control Systems, Weight and Balance Systems, & Radar. Don is most well-known for his work addressing Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) accidents. For decades, CFIT was one of the leading causes of fatalities in commercial aviation; it is considered a form of spatial disorientation, whereby the pilots cannot discern their position and orientation in proximity to the earth surface. These incidents were the leading cause of airplane accident loss of life having reportedly caused over 9,000 deaths since 1944. The technologies pioneered by Don Bateman have virtually eliminated what used to be the most common type of airplane disaster. Beginning in 1970, Don was instrumental in establishing global recognition of CFIT risk and the need for improved pilot training supported by advanced technologies and tools to prevent pilots in poor visibility from unintentionally flying aircraft into terrain or other obstacles. This led to the invention and subsequent introduction of the original Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) which used existing aircraft sensors such as the downward looking radar altimeter, to provide the pilot with advanced warning of impending impacts with terrain. In 1974, based on recommendations from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandated that all large turbine and turbojet airplanes be required to install GPWS equipment. Over 35,000 GPWS were installed between 1971 and 1998. From its initial development and based on knowledge gained from accident and incident analysis and vigorous flight testing, GPWS was continually improved and new capabilities such as Wind Shear Detection & Annunciation were added. However, it was in 1994 that the GPWS technology took the most substantial leap forward with the integration of GPS technology. What would become the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS), leveraged advancements in digital data storage and processing. Don began assembling a worldwide database of terrain, obstacle and runway data and used this data to provide pilots with both a forward look and improved situational awareness of any surrounding terrain. With this database and supporting alerting algorithms, EGPWS increased the pilot's warning time from seconds to minutes, a major advancement in the prevention of CFIT accidents. In subsequent years, Don evolved EGPWS to accommodate the unique operating characteristics of helicopters. There are now over 55,000 aircraft equipped with EGPWS and the technology is standard equipment on all commercial aircraft in production today. Expanding on EGPWS technology, Bateman and his team developed other safety products including Synthetic Vision, that displays EGPWS data in a 3-D format so pilots can literally ``see'' the hills and surrounding terrain with visual cues that give pilots a sense of how fast they are approaching potential obstacles. As Bill Voss, former president and CEO, Flight Safety Foundation, fittingly stated: ``Don Bateman has probably saved more lives than any single person in the history of aviation''. . . and the impact of his work will be felt globally for decades to come. I understand Don Bateman intends to spend his retirement enjoying his family, traveling, and staying involved with the avionics industry. I congratulate Don Bateman on his many accomplishments and years of outstanding service to the aviation community on this milestone occasion. He is truly an asset to those millions of passengers around the globe who are safe in the skies each year through the use of his technologies. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 87 (Friday, June 3, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E820] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DON BATEMAN ______ HON.

Beginning in 1970, Don was instrumental in establishing global recognition of CFIT risk and the need for improved pilot training supported by advanced technologies and tools to prevent pilots in poor visibility from unintentionally flying aircraft into terrain or other obstacles. This led to the invention and subsequent introduction of the original Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) which used existing aircraft sensors such as the downward looking radar altimeter, to provide the pilot with advanced warning of impending impacts with terrain. In 1974, based on recommendations from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandated that all large turbine and turbojet airplanes be required to install GPWS equipment. Over 35,000 GPWS were installed between 1971 and 1998. From its initial development and based on knowledge gained from accident and incident analysis and vigorous flight testing, GPWS was continually improved and new capabilities such as Wind Shear Detection & Annunciation were added. However, it was in 1994 that the GPWS technology took the most substantial leap forward with the integration of GPS technology. What would become the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS), leveraged advancements in digital data storage and processing. Don began assembling a worldwide database of terrain, obstacle and runway data and used this data to provide pilots with both a forward look and improved situational awareness of any surrounding terrain. With this database and supporting alerting algorithms, EGPWS increased the pilot's warning time from seconds to minutes, a major advancement in the prevention of CFIT accidents. In subsequent years, Don evolved EGPWS to accommodate the unique operating characteristics of helicopters. There are now over 55,000 aircraft equipped with EGPWS and the technology is standard equipment on all commercial aircraft in production today. Expanding on EGPWS technology, Bateman and his team developed other safety products including Synthetic Vision, that displays EGPWS data in a 3-D format so pilots can literally ``see'' the hills and surrounding terrain with visual cues that give pilots a sense of how fast they are approaching potential obstacles. As Bill Voss, former president and CEO, Flight Safety Foundation, fittingly stated: ``Don Bateman has probably saved more lives than any single person in the history of aviation''. . . and the impact of his work will be felt globally for decades to come. I understand Don Bateman intends to spend his retirement enjoying his family, traveling, and staying involved with the avionics industry. I congratulate Don Bateman on his many accomplishments and years of outstanding service to the aviation community on this milestone occasion. He is truly an asset to those millions of passengers around the globe who are safe in the skies each year through the use of his technologies. ____________________",package_114_268.csv,5244,5244,5309,"[congressional record volume 162, number 87 (friday, june 3, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e820] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring don bateman ______ hon. sam graves of missouri in the house of representatives friday, june 3, 2016 mr. graves of missouri. mr. speaker, i rise today to recognize mr. c. don bateman, corporate fellow and chief engineer-technologist for flight safety systems and technology at honeywell aerospace. as the man behind the first ground proximity warning system (gpws) and the revolutionary enhanced ground proximity warning system (egpws), mr. bateman is a true champion of safety for the aviation industry. don has received a long list of accolades, including receiving the u.s. presidential medal of technology and innovation in 2011. bateman also is in the national inventors hall of fame, an aviation path finder in the museum of flight, and a royal aeronautical society fellow. he received aviation week's laurel for it/electronics and its award for lifetime achievement, and in 2014 picked up the elmer a. sperry award for enhancing the art of transportation. over his 60 year career in the aviation industry, don's intense focus on identifying, understanding, and addressing aviation safety risks has led to some of the most successful safety solutions in aviation history. he holds over 50 u.s. and 90 foreign patents related to a wide variety of safety-related avionics including terrain awareness and warning systems, heads-up display systems, speed control/auto throttle systems, stall warning systems, automatic flight control systems, weight and balance systems, & radar. don is most well-known for his work addressing controlled flight into terrain (cfit) accidents. for decades, cfit was one of the leading causes of fatalities in commercial aviation; it is considered a form of spatial disorientation, whereby the pilots cannot discern their position and orientation in proximity to the earth surface. these incidents were the leading cause of airplane accident loss of life having reportedly caused over 9,000 deaths since 1944. the technologies pioneered by don bateman have virtually eliminated what used to be the most common type of airplane disaster. beginning in 1970, don was instrumental in establishing global recognition of cfit risk and the need for improved pilot training supported by advanced technologies and tools to prevent pilots in poor visibility from unintentionally flying aircraft into terrain or other obstacles. this led to the invention and subsequent introduction of the original ground proximity warning system (gpws) which used existing aircraft sensors such as the downward looking radar altimeter, to provide the pilot with advanced warning of impending impacts with terrain. in 1974, based on recommendations from the u.s. national transportation safety board, the federal aviation administration (faa) mandated that all large turbine and turbojet airplanes be required to install gpws equipment. over 35,000 gpws were installed between 1971 and 1998. from its initial development and based on knowledge gained from accident and incident analysis and vigorous flight testing, gpws was continually improved and new capabilities such as wind shear detection & annunciation were added. however, it was in 1994 that the gpws technology took the most substantial leap forward with the integration of gps technology. what would become the enhanced ground proximity warning system (egpws), leveraged advancements in digital data storage and processing. don began assembling a worldwide database of terrain, obstacle and runway data and used this data to provide pilots with both a forward look and improved situational awareness of any surrounding terrain. with this database and supporting alerting algorithms, egpws increased the pilot's warning time from seconds to minutes, a major advancement in the prevention of cfit accidents. in subsequent years, don evolved egpws to accommodate the unique operating characteristics of helicopters. there are now over 55,000 aircraft equipped with egpws and the technology is standard equipment on all commercial aircraft in production today. expanding on egpws technology, bateman and his team developed other safety products including synthetic vision, that displays egpws data in a 3-d format so pilots can literally ``see'' the hills and surrounding terrain with visual cues that give pilots a sense of how fast they are approaching potential obstacles. as bill voss, former president and ceo, flight safety foundation, fittingly stated: ``don bateman has probably saved more lives than any single person in the history of aviation''. . . and the impact of his work will be felt globally for decades to come. i understand don bateman intends to spend his retirement enjoying his family, traveling, and staying involved with the avionics industry. i congratulate don bateman on his many accomplishments and years of outstanding service to the aviation community on this milestone occasion. he is truly an asset to those millions of passengers around the globe who are safe in the skies each year through the use of his technologies. ____________________",5244

LAUTENBERG CHEMICAL SAFETY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT ______ HON. KEITH ELLISON of minnesota in the house of representatives Friday, June 3, 2016 Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I support the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act because too many Americans are getting sick from dangerous, unregulated chemicals found in the products we use every day. This bill would protect public health by making long-overdue chemical safety reforms. Today, industries can release hundreds of chemicals each year into our homes and workplaces without any federal requirement to consider their safety. Research has linked chemicals used in everyday products, such as household cleaners, clothing, and furniture, to serious illnesses like cancer, infertility, diabetes and Parkinson's. But currently, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)--our broken chemical safety law--gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) little power to do anything about these dangers. Under TSCA, only a small fraction of the thousands of chemicals used in our products have ever been reviewed for safety. The law is so weak that the EPA couldn't even regulate asbestos. In 1989, after 10 years of research and more than 100,000 pages of administrative record supporting action, the EPA issued a rule under TSCA to ban most uses of asbestos. But two years later, the EPA's regulation was overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals; while acknowledging that ``asbestos is a potential carcinogen at all levels of exposure,'' the Court ruled that the agency's administrative record failed to demonstrate that the regulation was the ``least burdensome alternative,'' as required under the law. Since the court's ruling, the burden to regulate most toxic substances under TSCA has been insurmountable. The reforms in the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act would help keep our communities safer by requiring reviews for chemicals in use today, mandating greater scrutiny of new chemicals, and removing barriers that have prevented the EPA from regulating highly toxic substances in the past, such as asbestos. This reform is an urgently needed next step, but there are still problems with this bill and more work should be done to protect our communities. Provisions in this bill sought by the chemical industry create unprecedented state preemption standards and put limitations on the EPA's ability to monitor chemicals in imported products. Federal policy should be seen as a floor, not a ceiling, when it comes to establishing standards for public health and safety. We must support states, like my home state of Minnesota, that have led the way in creating chemical safety standards that protect their residents. Last year in Minnesota, we took an important step toward protecting children and firefighters' health when the legislature passed a law to prohibit four toxic flame retardants (Deca, HBCD, TCEP and TDCPP) from children's products and upholstered furniture. Policies that preempt state action or restrict EPA's ability to monitor imported products threaten public health and safety. We need to fight back against these bad policies as we continue our efforts to reform TSCA. For my part, I will continue to be an advocate for reform that protects public health, not the chemical industry. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 87 (Friday, June 3, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E821] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FRANK R.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Friday, June 3, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to take a moment to honor the life of one of my constituents, Mrs. Elsa Anders of Purcellville, Virginia. Throughout her life, Mrs. Anders was known as a philanthropic and community leader, and friend to so many throughout the Commonwealth. Her work over the years has positively influenced the lives of countless members of our community and the 10th District of Virginia. Mrs. Anders was born 1948 in Livermore, California, but grew up in Washington, D.C. She attended Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School and George Washington University, where she received her Master's in Education. She was well known for her over twenty years of work in the DC and Loudoun County public schools systems as a teacher and certified speech pathologist. As a community leader, Elsa participated in various school and local activities. Among her countless volunteer hours given to the community, she was passionate about her work with the Alpha-1 Foundation, Waterford Foundation, Purcellville Business Association, and All Ages Read Together, of which she was a founding member. The Purcellville Business Association believes that a business organization is critical to the health and success of a town, city, or county. For many years, the PBA has proven that the community and the businesses therein Purcellville are of the utmost importance to its members. They started such important events as the annual town Christmas parade and a trolley tour of town businesses and historic features. Elsa Anders was an integral part of this history of the Purcellville Business Association, where she was elected secretary and ran the Membership Committee for many years. She very much exemplified the original charter of the Purcellville Business Association to ``promote the economic, industrial, professional, cultural, and civic welfare of the Town of Purcellville.'' While Elsa worked tirelessly to advance the cause of the Purcellville Business Association and the Town of Purcellville itself, I would be remiss if I did not impart that her true passion was her family. She cared deeply for her husband, her children, and her grandchildren. Elsa leaves behind her loving husband, Robert Lauten, and her three children: Andrew Lauten, Garrett Lauten, and Peter Anders-Lauten, and three grandchildren, Ruth Ella Lauten, and Collum and Chloe Murphy.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Friday, June 3, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge several schools in Loudoun County that have been named Schools to Watch in 2016 by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform. Eagle Ridge, Farmwell Station, J. Lupton Simpson, River Bend, and Sterling Middle Schools have been recognized as five of only 145 schools around the country to receive this honor. This honor requires schools to excel in the following criteria: academic excellence, developmental responsiveness, and social equality. Each of these schools has challenged their students to achieve academic excellence over the course of the school year. They have also shown a unique ability to identify and work with early adolescent developmental challenges, all while providing every student with the highest quality of teachers, resources, and support, regardless of socioeconomic status. Coming from a family of educators, I understand how important a strong education is to the future of our nation. It is schools like these that will continue to help shape the United States' role in the evolving global economy, while at the same time producing many of our nation's future leaders. Eagle Ridge, Farmwell Station, J. Lupton Simpson, River Bend, and Sterling Middle Schools have clearly shown a dedication to developing and educating our children. The outstanding qualities they have all exemplified are not to be understated; what they have achieved is something of which to be truly proud. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating these 2016 Schools to Watch for their incredible achievements.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge several schools in Loudoun County that have been named Schools to Watch in 2016 by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform. Eagle Ridge, Farmwell Station, J. Lupton Simpson, River Bend, and Sterling Middle Schools have been recognized as five of only 145 schools around the country to receive this honor. This honor requires schools to excel in the following criteria: academic excellence, developmental responsiveness, and social equality. Each of these schools has challenged their students to achieve academic excellence over the course of the school year. They have also shown a unique ability to identify and work with early adolescent developmental challenges, all while providing every student with the highest quality of teachers, resources, and support, regardless of socioeconomic status. Coming from a family of educators, I understand how important a strong education is to the future of our nation. It is schools like these that will continue to help shape the United States' role in the evolving global economy, while at the same time producing many of our nation's future leaders. Eagle Ridge, Farmwell Station, J. Lupton Simpson, River Bend, and Sterling Middle Schools have clearly shown a dedication to developing and educating our children. The outstanding qualities they have all exemplified are not to be understated; what they have achieved is something of which to be truly proud. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating these 2016 Schools to Watch for their incredible achievements.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Friday, June 3, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great American organization, the Coalition to Salute America's Heroes, that recently celebrated 12 years of service this past May. The Coalition, headquartered in my district, is a 501(c)(3), nonprofit, non-partisan organization established in 2004 to provide severely wounded veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with immediate, invaluable lifelines. The Coalition is distinguished from other veteran-focused groups by its direct financial assistance to America's wounded warriors. Its Emergency Financial Aid program has stopped foreclosure proceedings on veterans' homes, kept their vehicles from being repossessed, put food on their tables, provided diapers for their babies, and even helped steer [[Page E822]] many men and women away from suicide. Its innovative Heroes Thanking Heroes program provides transitional, part-time, flexible employment to more than 40 combat-wounded veterans or their primary caregivers, enabling them to make phone calls from their homes, usually to personally thank donors for their contributions to the Coalition. Other aspects include an emergency financial aid program, a holiday gift program, and road to recovery conferences. The Coalition has done tremendous work in Virginia and across the country such as donating more than $45 million in direct aid to veterans. The Coalition has provided tens of thousands of dollars through grants to other notable veterans' organizations in Virginia and elsewhere. Under the leadership of a constituent of mine, President & CEO David Walker, the Coalition has further expanded its support of our wounded warriors and become one of the most respected veterans-support groups in the nation. In fact, over two-thirds of the Coalition's staff are combat-wounded or their spouse or caregiver. Recently, the Coalition made a substantial grant of direct financial aid to HeroHomes, another worthy organization, to assist five wounded veterans and their families with new homes that meet their different physical needs. The Coalition has also supported the Boulder Crest Retreat for Military and Veteran Wellness in Bluemont, yet another organization in my district that is doing tremendous work for veterans who need mental and physical recovery from the suffering of war. I look forward to watching the Coalition to Salute America's Heroes continue to make a meaningful difference in the lives of so many American heroes. The debt of gratitude owed to the men, women, and their families who have served as part of our nation's armed forces is impossible to repay. I have been honored to recognize their sacrifice and support efforts to empower members of the military as they adjust back to civilian life. To that end, I supported the Hire More Heroes Act, a common-sense bipartisan piece of legislation that will help create jobs for veterans transitioning to civilian careers. I am proud that the Coalition to Support America's Heroes is based in my district in Leesburg and know they will continue to help brave men and women all across our country. The work they do cannot be overstated and I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the important work the Coalition to Salute America's Heroes continues to do each day to help veterans. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 87 (Friday, June 3, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E821-E822] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE COALITION TO SALUTE AMERICA'S HEROES ______ HON.

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Friday, June 3, 2016 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring four special women in the District of Columbia who attend the Zion Baptist Church and will reach the significant milestone of turning 100 years old this summer. All four women are native Washingtonians, have known each other since early childhood and have remained lifelong friends. The Zion Baptist Church will officially recognize Ruth Elizabeth Chatman Hammett (June 14, 1916), Gladys Ware Butler (July 4, 1916), Bernice Grimes Underwood (July 23, 1916) and Leona Costello Barnes (July 18, 1916) on June 18, 2016. As little girls, the four grew up together in Southwest D.C. and could not have predicted, as they reflected on the many years and changes that followed their lives, that they would one day celebrate their 100th birthdays together. As they grew up, got married and had children, they witnessed the shaping of a remarkable century. They had relatives who fought in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. They felt hope listening to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the despair of the riots that wracked their beloved city after his assassination. As they settled into middle age, they saw their family members join in the civil rights struggle for equality as they lived out their days in the neighborhood, and they never imagined that their friendship would outlast the stoops and storefronts. But in the 1950s, the area was marked for urban renewal and razed, decimating the community as their church congregation and neighbors were eventually scattered. But despite this upheaval, the four women's friendship persisted. They saw each other become grandmothers, great- grandmothers, and ``great-great-greats''. They still share fond memories of places and people that no one else remembers and by the age of 92, the four women thought that they had seen it all. But then something truly amazing happened that they never would have predicted. A black man became the President of the United States. To each of these four women it was the culmination of a lifelong journey as black people in America, and they only wished that some of their relatives could have lived to witness such a historic event. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join me in recognizing the full lives of Ruth Elizabeth Chatman Hammett, Gladys Ware Butler, Bernice Grimes Underwood, and Leona Costello Barnes, and in celebrating this momentous occasion, which they are sharing together as lifelong friends. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 87 (Friday, June 3, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E822] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING FOUR SPECIAL WOMEN ______ HON.

CREC-2016-06-03-pt1-PgE822-2,CREC-2016-06-03,114,LETTERS FROM NORTH SIDE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ON LONG ISLAND SOUND,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 87 (Friday, June 3, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E822-E824] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LETTERS FROM NORTH SIDE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ON LONG ISLAND SOUND ______ HON. STEVE ISRAEL of new york in the house of representatives Friday, June 3, 2016 Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share letters written to me by Mrs. Widyn's 4th Grade Class at North Side Elementary School in East Williston about the importance of preserving Long Island Sound. It was a pleasure to visit this class and see how motivated they are to save our environment broadly, and Long Island Sound specifically. I would like to insert letters they wrote to me in the Congressional Record. Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask the Congress to set aside some money to keep the Long Island Sound clean. I have many reasons why we need to protect this beautiful body of water. One reason is that it is our greatest natural resource. Also, there are many animal habitats that are getting wrecked because of all the dirty garbage. Some of the animals are birds, wildlife and marine life. There is also a bird there that is endangered called the Piping Plover. The Piping Plover might become extinct if we keep this up. One last reason is that in a few years there would so much garbage and pollution that it will cost even more money to fix than it already does. I am 9 years old and I figured out the importance of keeping the Long Island Sound in good shape. I hope the people we elect to represent us gives this problem their consideration and that they understand the importance of this big issue, not just for the people who live on the Long Island Sound, but for the environment that everybody shares. Sincerely, Brianna Janicek. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to give money to protect the Long Island Sound from being polluted! It is our greatest natural resource! A reason why we need money to protect the Long Island Sound is we eat fish, oysters and clams from the Long Island Sound and nobody wants to eat fish, oysters or clams that have been in polluted water! Another reason is polluted water can cause habitat loss for marine life, and if there are no fish, the birds that eat fish will starve! Finally, many people like swimming in the Long Island Sound and if the water they're swimming in is polluted, they will not want to swim there anymore! I am 9 years old, and realize how important the Long Island Sound is. I hope Congress sets aside money to protect the Long Island Sound! Thank you for reading my letter. Sincerely, Grace Wong. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to because I think the Congress should set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound beautiful and clean. I think we should protect the Long Island Sound because it is our greatest natural resource. It gives us five billion dollars in our economy. If the water is not clean, people will not want to come here anymore and we can kiss five billion dollars bye-bye. People who live near the Long Island Sound will want to move if the water is polluted because dirty and filthy water will be washing against their houses. I would not want to live their either. Finally, wildlife and marine life will continue to decrease in population. The piping plover will eventually become extinct if we continue to pollute the Long Island Sound. Also, the fish that we eat could be dirty and unhealthy for our body. I know I am only nine years old, but I take this very seriously. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope something is done to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Sahama Dhama. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful. There are many reasons why we need to protect this body of water. First of all, the Long Island Sound is one of our greatest resources. Also, if it is polluted many animals may die like birds, wildlife, and marine life. We should also have money for the Long Island Sound because it helps our economy. Fishing, tourism, and recreation take place on the Long Island Sound. I am 9 years old and I realize how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound protected. I hope everyone who loves the Long Island Sound understands its importance for the future of our environment that we all share. [[Page E823]] Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Rahul Dawar. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am a 9 year old boy who is writing a letter to you to ask Congress to give money to protect the Long Island Sound. Here are the three reasons why we should protect the Long Island Sound. First, the Long Island Sound is one of Long Island's greatest resources. Second, habitat loss might happen if people keep polluting the Long Island Sound. The piping plover, birds, wildlife, and marine life may be lost. Lastly, water quality needs to be improved. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you will ask Congress to realize how important it is to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Joseph Dolezal. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask congress to give money to keep the Long Island Sound safe. There are many good reasons why we need to do this. I am 10 years old and I realize how important it is to keep this beautiful body of water safe. If we do not do this, it will cause habitat loss for wildlife, marine life and birds such as the piping plover. Also, it will make our waters polluted, so we need to have money to improve our water quality. And I believe the Long Island Sound is our greatest natural resource. I hope the people we elect to represent us understand the importance of this issue, not just for the people of Long Island but for the future of the environment we share. Sincerely, Anthony Lopez. ____ Dear Congressman Israel, I am writing this letter to you because I want to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful for everyone. I have 3 reasons why we should keep this body of water clean. I am 10 years old and in 4th grade. I know how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound protected. My first reason why we should keep the Long Island Sound clean is . . . It's not ok for the people that live near the Long Island Sound to have dirty water with garbage in them coming up to their houses. My second reason is that all this garbage is hurting the marine life, and if people are fishing they might not get healthy fish. My 3rd reason is that if we do not stop this now, in the future there is going to be more garbage and it will cost more money and it will be harder to fix the Long Island Sound. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope we do something to help the Long Island Sound. Thank You for coming to my classroom. Sincerely, Kayla Rogan. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful. There are many reasons why we need to protect this body of water. One reason is that 20 million people live within 50 miles of the Long Island Sound. Also, animals can lose their habitats like the Piping Plover. Finally, it is our greatest natural resource. I am 9 years old and I realize how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound Protected. I hope that this letter will convince people to keep the Long Island Sound clean and safe. Thank you for reading my letter. Sincerely, Chanelle Moza. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set money aside to keep the Long Island Sound clean and not polluted. I am 9 years old, and I know how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound protected. I hope all of Congress understands how important it is to help the environment and the Sound. I think people should stop polluting the Sound so the marine animals under water are safe. People swim in this body of water so we need to make sure it stays clean. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope your ideas about the Long Island Sound are heard in Congress on the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Rylan Rockfeld. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you because I would like you to get money for the Long Island Sound so it will stay beautiful. There are many reasons to protect this water. I am ten years old, and I see how important it is to protect the Long Island Sound. We need to keep the Long Island Sound clean because there are birds that might take a sip of the water and if it's polluted it would hurt the birds. There is marine life that needs to be protected. They might eat the trash from the Long Island Sound and die. If you catch a fish and the fish took in some polluted water, it would not be safe to eat. Another reason why we should ask congress for money is so we help clean the Long Island Sound and help marine animals. Sincerely, Robyn Garnock. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing this to you so you can protect the Long Island Sound. Please help protect the Long Island Sound and listen to my letter. I am 9 years old and love animals. Lots of people litter and that hurts the animals in the Long Island Sound. I am very worried some animals that live there will become extinct. If Congress gives money, we can help keep the Long Island Sound clean. Also, we do not want the water in the Sound to be polluted. We need money to keep it clean. I would like clean water to drink and swim in. Another reason is the Long Island Sound is one of our greatest natural resources and we don't want it ruined. Thank you for listening to my letter, and do the best you can do to keep the Long Island Sound safe! Sincerely, Rio Malito. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and a nice place to live next to. There are many reasons why we need to protect this body of water. One reason we need to protect the Long Island Sound is to protect the animals that live in or next to it. We eat some of those animals and we don't want to eat polluted animals. Another reason is we don't want polluted water in our drinking water. One more reason we need to protect the Long Island Sound is it is one of our greatest natural resources. We swim in the Long Island Sound and also play on beaches next to it. I am 9 years old, and I realize how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound safe. I hope the people we elect to represent us give this matter their consideration and understand the importance of this issue, not only for people who live near the Long Island Sound, but for the future of the environment we all share. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Rayen Kuo. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful. There are many reason why we need to protect this body of water. First, most people come to live in Long Island because we have water around it so people can swim and go fishing. Another reason is all of the fish could be dead because of pollution in the Long Island Sound. Over 20 million people live less than 50 miles from the Long Island Sound. My fourth reason is Long Island Sound is one of our great resources. People like to go banana boating and tubing. How can we do all that if the Long Island Sound is not clean. I am 10 years old and I realize how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound protected. I hope the people we elect to represent us give this matter their consideration and understand the importance of this issue, people who live near the Long Island Sound, but for the future of the environment we all share. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Austin Prince. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and a nice place to swim. There are many reasons why we need to protect the Long Island Sound. One reason to keep the long Island sound clean is because the Long Island Sound brings $5 billion to our economy. For example, people want to buy clean fish from a fish market and you wouldn't want to buy fish with plastic in them. Also, if we keep on polluting the water, in the future we might have wiped out the piping plover species and a species of fish that might be endangered. Lastly, 20 million people live within 50 miles of the Long Island Sound. You don't want polluted water and garbage on your beaches. I am 9 years old and I realize how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound protected. I hope the people we elect to represent us give this matter their consideration and understand the importance of the issue. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Amelia Crosby. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful. There are many reasons why we need to protect this body of water. I am 9 years old and I realize how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound clean. Here are some reasons. First, we need to improve water quality so the marine animals don't get sick. Next, 20 million people live within 50 miles from the Long Island Sound so we have to keep it clean. Finally, the water in the Long Island Sound needs to be clean because it could affect our drinking water. Also, we don't want the garbage from the Sound to be right in front of our houses. Clearly, it is important to keep the Long Island Sound clean. Sincerely, Aryan Badlani. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: Hello. I am writing this letter so you can ask Congress [[Page E824]] to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and gorgeous. There are a lot of reasons. I am 10 years old and I wish we can protect the Long Island Sound so it is not polluted. There are more than 20 million people living near the shore of the Long Island Sound. People get fish from the Long Island Sound, so if fish take in polluted water we will eat the fish and we will have the polluted water inside our own body which is bad for us. Lastly, there is a lot of wildlife that live on the Long Island Sound. For example, the Piping Plover is endangered so we need to watch out before they are extinct. There is marine life and will harm the animals. This money is for the future of our lives. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope this will come true. Sincerely, Aaron Chang. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful. I have some reasons why we need to protect this body of water. One reason is there are endangered animals that really need the Long Island Sound to live. Another reason is people come here to the Long Island Sound to swim and go boating. I am 9 years old, and I realize how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound protected. I really hope the people we elect to represent us give this matter their consideration and understand the importance of the issue, not only for the people who live near the Long Island Sound, but for the future of the environment all of us share. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Nicole Davidoff. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing this so I can ask you to save the Long Island sound by using money for it because it is really important. Money will help keep it clean and not polluted and animals will be saved. I am ten year old and I found out how important the Long Island Sound is. We have to save the Long Island Sound. Polluted and everybody loves it. They love the Sound because the northern beaches have a lot of people that visit, but if the Long Island Sound gets polluted nobody will come to the beaches. Also, when you clean the water you can fish and sell it, but the water is polluted; fish and marine animals are dying and losing their habitats. If the Long Island Sound is not protected in the future nobody will go there. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you will save the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Brandon Katz.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 87 (Friday, June 3, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E822-E824] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LETTERS FROM NORTH SIDE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ON LONG ISLAND SOUND ______ HON.

I think people should stop polluting the Sound so the marine animals under water are safe. People swim in this body of water so we need to make sure it stays clean. Thank you for reading my letter.

Sincerely, Rylan Rockfeld. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you because I would like you to get money for the Long Island Sound so it will stay beautiful. There are many reasons to protect this water. I am ten years old, and I see how important it is to protect the Long Island Sound. We need to keep the Long Island Sound clean because there are birds that might take a sip of the water and if it's polluted it would hurt the birds. There is marine life that needs to be protected. They might eat the trash from the Long Island Sound and die. If you catch a fish and the fish took in some polluted water, it would not be safe to eat. Another reason why we should ask congress for money is so we help clean the Long Island Sound and help marine animals. Sincerely, Robyn Garnock. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing this to you so you can protect the Long Island Sound. Please help protect the Long Island Sound and listen to my letter. I am 9 years old and love animals. Lots of people litter and that hurts the animals in the Long Island Sound. I am very worried some animals that live there will become extinct. If Congress gives money, we can help keep the Long Island Sound clean. Also, we do not want the water in the Sound to be polluted. We need money to keep it clean. I would like clean water to drink and swim in. Another reason is the Long Island Sound is one of our greatest natural resources and we don't want it ruined. Thank you for listening to my letter, and do the best you can do to keep the Long Island Sound safe! Sincerely, Rio Malito. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and a nice place to live next to. There are many reasons why we need to protect this body of water. One reason we need to protect the Long Island Sound is to protect the animals that live in or next to it. We eat some of those animals and we don't want to eat polluted animals. Another reason is we don't want polluted water in our drinking water. One more reason we need to protect the Long Island Sound is it is one of our greatest natural resources. We swim in the Long Island Sound and also play on beaches next to it. I am 9 years old, and I realize how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound safe. I hope the people we elect to represent us give this matter their consideration and understand the importance of this issue, not only for people who live near the Long Island Sound, but for the future of the environment we all share. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Rayen Kuo. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful. There are many reason why we need to protect this body of water. First, most people come to live in Long Island because we have water around it so people can swim and go fishing. Another reason is all of the fish could be dead because of pollution in the Long Island Sound. Over 20 million people live less than 50 miles from the Long Island Sound. My fourth reason is Long Island Sound is one of our great resources. People like to go banana boating and tubing. How can we do all that if the Long Island Sound is not clean. I am 10 years old and I realize how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound protected. I hope the people we elect to represent us give this matter their consideration and understand the importance of this issue, people who live near the Long Island Sound, but for the future of the environment we all share. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Austin Prince. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and a nice place to swim. There are many reasons why we need to protect the Long Island Sound. One reason to keep the long Island sound clean is because the Long Island Sound brings $5 billion to our economy. For example, people want to buy clean fish from a fish market and you wouldn't want to buy fish with plastic in them. Also, if we keep on polluting the water, in the future we might have wiped out the piping plover species and a species of fish that might be endangered. Lastly, 20 million people live within 50 miles of the Long Island Sound. You don't want polluted water and garbage on your beaches. I am 9 years old and I realize how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound protected. I hope the people we elect to represent us give this matter their consideration and understand the importance of the issue. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to protect the Long Island Sound.

I am writing this letter so you can ask Congress [[Page E824]] to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and gorgeous. There are a lot of reasons. I am 10 years old and I wish we can protect the Long Island Sound so it is not polluted. There are more than 20 million people living near the shore of the Long Island Sound. People get fish from the Long Island Sound, so if fish take in polluted water we will eat the fish and we will have the polluted water inside our own body which is bad for us. Lastly, there is a lot of wildlife that live on the Long Island Sound. For example, the Piping Plover is endangered so we need to watch out before they are extinct. There is marine life and will harm the animals. This money is for the future of our lives. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope this will come true. Sincerely, Aaron Chang. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful.

Money will help keep it clean and not polluted and animals will be saved. I am ten year old and I found out how important the Long Island Sound is. We have to save the Long Island Sound. Polluted and everybody loves it. They love the Sound because the northern beaches have a lot of people that visit, but if the Long Island Sound gets polluted nobody will come to the beaches. Also, when you clean the water you can fish and sell it, but the water is polluted; fish and marine animals are dying and losing their habitats. If the Long Island Sound is not protected in the future nobody will go there. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you will save the Long Island Sound.

STEVE ISRAEL of new york in the house of representatives Friday, June 3, 2016 Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share letters written to me by Mrs. Widyn's 4th Grade Class at North Side Elementary School in East Williston about the importance of preserving Long Island Sound. It was a pleasure to visit this class and see how motivated they are to save our environment broadly, and Long Island Sound specifically. I would like to insert letters they wrote to me in the Congressional Record. Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask the Congress to set aside some money to keep the Long Island Sound clean. I have many reasons why we need to protect this beautiful body of water. One reason is that it is our greatest natural resource. Also, there are many animal habitats that are getting wrecked because of all the dirty garbage. Some of the animals are birds, wildlife and marine life. There is also a bird there that is endangered called the Piping Plover. The Piping Plover might become extinct if we keep this up. One last reason is that in a few years there would so much garbage and pollution that it will cost even more money to fix than it already does. I am 9 years old and I figured out the importance of keeping the Long Island Sound in good shape. I hope the people we elect to represent us gives this problem their consideration and that they understand the importance of this big issue, not just for the people who live on the Long Island Sound, but for the environment that everybody shares. Sincerely, Brianna Janicek. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to give money to protect the Long Island Sound from being polluted! It is our greatest natural resource! A reason why we need money to protect the Long Island Sound is we eat fish, oysters and clams from the Long Island Sound and nobody wants to eat fish, oysters or clams that have been in polluted water! Another reason is polluted water can cause habitat loss for marine life, and if there are no fish, the birds that eat fish will starve! Finally, many people like swimming in the Long Island Sound and if the water they're swimming in is polluted, they will not want to swim there anymore! I am 9 years old, and realize how important the Long Island Sound is. I hope Congress sets aside money to protect the Long Island Sound! Thank you for reading my letter. Sincerely, Grace Wong. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to because I think the Congress should set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound beautiful and clean. I think we should protect the Long Island Sound because it is our greatest natural resource. It gives us five billion dollars in our economy. If the water is not clean, people will not want to come here anymore and we can kiss five billion dollars bye-bye. People who live near the Long Island Sound will want to move if the water is polluted because dirty and filthy water will be washing against their houses. I would not want to live their either. Finally, wildlife and marine life will continue to decrease in population. The piping plover will eventually become extinct if we continue to pollute the Long Island Sound. Also, the fish that we eat could be dirty and unhealthy for our body. I know I am only nine years old, but I take this very seriously. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope something is done to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Sahama Dhama. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful. There are many reasons why we need to protect this body of water. First of all, the Long Island Sound is one of our greatest resources. Also, if it is polluted many animals may die like birds, wildlife, and marine life. We should also have money for the Long Island Sound because it helps our economy. Fishing, tourism, and recreation take place on the Long Island Sound. I am 9 years old and I realize how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound protected. I hope everyone who loves the Long Island Sound understands its importance for the future of our environment that we all share. [[Page E823]] Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Rahul Dawar. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am a 9 year old boy who is writing a letter to you to ask Congress to give money to protect the Long Island Sound. Here are the three reasons why we should protect the Long Island Sound. First, the Long Island Sound is one of Long Island's greatest resources. Second, habitat loss might happen if people keep polluting the Long Island Sound. The piping plover, birds, wildlife, and marine life may be lost. Lastly, water quality needs to be improved. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you will ask Congress to realize how important it is to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, Joseph Dolezal. ____ Dear Congressman Israel: I am writing to you so you can ask congress to give money to keep the Long Island Sound safe. There are many good reasons why we need to do this. I am 10 years old and I realize how important it is to keep this beautiful body of water safe. If we do not do this, it will cause habitat loss for wildlife, marine life and birds such as the piping plover. Also, it will make our waters polluted, so we need to have money to improve our water quality. And I believe the Long Island Sound is our greatest natural resource. I hope the people we elect to represent us understand the importance of this issue, not just for the people of Long Island but for the future of the environment we share. Sincerely, Anthony Lopez. ____ Dear Congressman Israel, I am writing this letter to you because I want to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful for everyone. I have 3 reasons why we should keep this body of water clean. I am 10 years old and in 4th grade. I know how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound protected. My first reason why we should keep the Long Island Sound clean is . . . It's not ok for the people that live near the Long Island Sound to have dirty water with garbage in them coming up to their houses. My second reason is that all this garbage is hurting the marine life, and if people are fishing they might not get healthy fish. My 3rd reason is that if we do not stop this now, in the future there is going to be more garbage and it will cost more money and it will be harder to fix the Long Island Sound. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope we do something to help the Long Island Sound. Thank You for coming to my classroom.
