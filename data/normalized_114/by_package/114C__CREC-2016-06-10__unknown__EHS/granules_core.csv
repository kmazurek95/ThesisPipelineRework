Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, recently I was proud to vote for a package of bills here on the floor of the United States House intended to help crack down on the terrible epidemic of prescription opioid abuse and heroin abuse across our Nation. Today, I want to recognize the efforts in the Pennsylvania General Assembly to assist in the goal of fighting back against all drug use. Specifically, a new law authored by State Representative Matt Baker, who represents a portion of Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, would go after designer drugs in which different chemicals are combined to create new drugs. This new law will speed up the process in adding these drugs to the State's list of banned drugs, enabling law enforcement to arrest and prosecute the individuals responsible. Giving members of our law enforcement community the tools that they need to thwart illegal drug manufacturers will save lives. Mr. Speaker, if you want to successfully fight back against a problem, you surround it. I am proud to see great lifesaving solutions coming from both the Federal and the State levels, with additional community action in the form of local roundtables and townhall meetings. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Page H3667] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATE EFFORTS TO CRACK DOWN ON OPIOID EPIDEMIC (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Two hundred years ago today, this daily publication began serving the people of Cayuga County by providing news and community announcements. Born in 1816 as the Auburn Gazette, this community newspaper has been known by many names over the years. In an editorial placed this past weekend, publisher Rob Forcey noted that the Auburn Citizen began publishing just 40 years after the birth of our country. The history of accomplished journalists at this publication includes William Dapping, a community hero who was awarded the very first special Pulitzer in 1930 for his esteemed work in covering the bloody 1929 Auburn State Prison riots. Today, the Citizen has evolved to cover a wide area of central New York, with web-based access to local and national news, weather, and community events. What is more, the publication has expanded into western Onondaga County, with the Skaneateles Journal and West Onondaga County Journal.

Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the families who are still struggling to make ends meet. Our economy has made great strides since the end of the recession. Like my colleagues, I have watched the unemployment rate tick down each month from 10 percent in 2009 to 5 percent today. According to the story that these numbers tell, our economy has recovered. But for nearly 8 million Americans still looking for work, our economy is still in a state of crisis. In my home district, more than 16 percent live in poverty, and the unemployment rate is three times the national rate, at 15 percent.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 767, I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 112) expressing the sense of Congress opposing the President's proposed $10 tax on every barrel of oil, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the concurrent resolution is considered read. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: H. Con. Res. 112 Whereas raising revenue and spending money are powers reserved to Congress by the Constitution; Whereas according to global economists, the United States oil and gas industry is currently experiencing the worst industry decline since similar commodity price collapses in the 1980s and 1990s forced oil companies to slash payrolls and dividends; Whereas global oil production exceeds demand by more than one million barrels a day, and Iran has promised to provide an additional 500,000 barrels a day to the world market, now that several sanctions have been lifted after the recent implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action; Whereas the price of a barrel of oil is currently around $30, less than a third of the $90-plus it was selling for 18 months ago; which would mean the President's proposal would be equivalent to a 33.3 percent tax, making the United States Federal excise tax on oil the highest of any domestic product; Whereas this tax could translate into as much as an additional 25 cents on a gallon of gas, when the Federal tax on gasoline is currently 18.40 cents per gallon; Whereas the oil and gas industry accounts for significant employment and is an even more significant driver of investment spending and growth along the supply chain, ranging from aggregates to steelmaking and specialist equipment; Whereas more than 258,000 people employed in oil and gas extraction and support activities globally, including more than 100,000 across the United States, have lost their jobs since October 2014; Whereas every lost oil and gas job leads to an additional 3.43 jobs cut in other sectors; Whereas that means the 114,000 job losses in the oil and gas sector wiped out an additional 391,000 jobs in other sectors last year and sliced economic growth to about 2.1 percent from 2.6 percent; Whereas more layoffs are virtually certain in the months ahead in oil and gas production, as well as along the supply chain and in petroleum-dependent economies, as the continued price slump filters through to even less drilling activity; Whereas the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas has fallen from over 1,900 in October 2014, to 744 at the end of November 2015, and just 619 at the end of January 2016, according to oilfield services firm Baker Hughes; Whereas manufacturers, for example, announced 37,221 layoffs in the past 12 months; Whereas shipments of steel in the United States--used to make oil and gas pipelines--were down 11.4 percent through the first 11 months of 2015 and the industry announced more than 12,000 layoffs during the past year, according to the American Steel and Iron Institute; Whereas believing that oil companies will pay the fee with no effect on consumer prices requires also believing that the producers won't pass their increased cost on to refiners, who won't in turn pass their costs on to the public; in other words, requires suspending belief in basic economics; Whereas this tax could also put American oil companies, at a competitive disadvantage with foreign oil companies, as imported oil may not face the same treatment; Whereas the domestic midstream and downstream stages of oil and gas production will be at a competitive disadvantage to their global competitors due to a $10 higher cost for every barrel of oil; Whereas in combination with a stronger dollar, slowing growth in international markets, and an overaccumulation of inventories through much of the economy, the oil slump is creating headwinds for manufacturers, freight firms, and the wider economy; and Whereas the oil and natural gas industry anchors our economy in terms of jobs, economic activity, and even State and local tax revenue in a challenging price environment: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That Congress finds that-- (1) any new tax placed on the struggling oil and gas industry will further prevent growth and development throughout the sector and encourage additional layoffs; and (2) the effect of a $10 tax on each barrel of oil sold in the United States-- (A) would raise the price of oil, and by extension gasoline; and (B) would result in a decrease in the consumption of oil. SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) a new tax should not be placed on oil, and (2) in considering future policy, Congress should carefully review the detrimental impacts of placing any new taxes on any industry that has seen a slash in jobs, revenue, and production. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The concurrent resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. General Leave Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H. Con. Res. 112, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the Obama administration, in its budget proposal, proposed a $10.25 tax on each barrel of oil. This will severely harm America's already struggling energy industry, but it will have a very detrimental impact throughout the American economy, and that is why I introduced H. Con. Res. 112, sending a very clear message that Congress and the American people refuse to allow this administration to fund an environmental agenda on the backs of working families. It is pretty simple. At $10.25 per barrel of oil, this increase would not only add significantly to the cost of a gallon of gasoline at the pump, certainly disproportionately hurting fixed-income families, seniors, and so forth, it would also have a detrimental impact on job creation, on wages, and on the Nation's overall economic health. This also would effectively act as an export tax on oil, just as we opened up the door to export crude oil to allow American producers to have market access worldwide, just like our Iranian opponents worldwide currently have the luxury to do. Why would we tie up the hands of American energy producers and allow the Iranians and OPEC to dominate world markets? Wrong. Secondly, at a time when, in Louisiana and Texas and other States on the coast, we understand how important our environment, our economy and energy policies are, we are looking to use revenue sharing to help us rebuild coastline and marsh and replenish our beaches, the administration opposes this. They have listed that in their budget proposal. This tax is a tax on hardworking American families. It is a tax on American competitiveness; it is a tax on American innovation; it is a tax on our energy security; and it is a tax on the very foundation of our national security. Now, the oil and gas industry has watched as market conditions have changed because of slow growth globally--low demand and abundant supply thanks to American innovation, largely. We have seen the oil price drop from $115 a barrel in November of 2014 to as low as $27 a barrel in January 2016. Right now, prices are hovering around $48, $49, $50 a barrel. This industry is struggling. This is the industry that took us out of recession with job creation and economic growth. Now, I know in my home State of Louisiana, just last year, we lost 11,700 jobs alone in Louisiana in the oil and gas sector, 5,500 in my hometown of Lafayette alone. Even worse, globally, over 250,000 people have lost their jobs. Of course, if you look at what happened in the first quarter of this year, the revised statistics on economic growth, 0.8 percent. How is American business going to create value and jobs with that kind of growth, that kind of private sector growth? Not only that, just last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics release showed [[Page H3678]] 38,000 jobs created last month, the worst number since 2010. That is a terrible statistic, with real human dimensions. This tax will make it worse if it were to go forward. In fact, the Tax Foundation created an economic model to show the impact of a $10.25-per-barrel tax over 10 years; and what this would do, if implemented, an estimated 137,000 Americans in full-time employment in this sector would lose their jobs. It is important to remember that oil is used for a lot more than just gasoline in our automobiles. The U.S. Energy Information Administration points out that a quarter of a barrel of crude--a quarter of each barrel of crude oil--is used for nonfuel goods such as plastic, asphalt, dyes, lubricants, power plants, home heating, and other nontransportation uses. In fact, products throughout the American economy have, as their base ingredient, these fossil fuel ingredients. This tax, $10.25, will be passed on to those industries and consumers across this country. The oil and gas industry supports more than 9 million American jobs, and what happens through this industry and within this industry reverberates throughout our entire U.S. economy. But it is also important to look at what this proposal would do as we view it through a national security lens. American innovation, the energy renaissance we saw with shale exploration and hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, as well as new deepwater technology and better assessments of our reserves, has given us this tremendous opportunity to change global energy security away from an OPEC- or Russian-driven model, where state-owned enterprises control pricing and control supply, to an American view of energy security, which our allies desperately want. It is a view of energy security with diversity of supply sources, transparent pricing, open markets, a view of energy security globally, uniquely American, that would help economic growth globally and help so many countries that are struggling today, many currently in recession. But energy security is linked to our national security, and we have an opportunity to create a Western Hemisphere energy trading bloc based on these principles rather than an OPEC or a Russian model. This is an opportunity for America to change not only energy security, but the entire national security environment in a more pro-American way. This tax would really be a stab in the heart of that. It is the wrong thing to do. And, of course, this tax would increase the cost of domestic production, translating into higher prices for oil and all petroleum products, potentially eroding America's price competitiveness in the global marketplace. If the purpose of this proposal was to increase revenue, then I would say that the President should be, instead, pursuing sound energy policies consisting of embracing this energy sector, American energy production, one of the clearest examples of American exceptionalism, not an unfettered drastic tax increase. If you want to build roads, we need economic growth and sensible tax policies that will help us build out our transportation. According to a report released by the American Petroleum Institute, our energy producers could create 1 million new jobs in just 7 years and increase revenue to Federal and State governments by $800 billion by 2030 if we allow this energy sector to do its work responsibly. It is time for our Nation to fully embrace the vast opportunities unleashed by this U.S. energy renaissance. Let's embrace this new era of abundance. Let's embrace this new era of energy diplomacy that puts America in a strong position. It is time for the President to stop his relentless tax and regulatory assault on the oil and gas industry that is only worsening our economic problems. This resolution shows very clearly that Congress stands for job creation over a radical political agenda, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans don't like the President's budget proposal. They have never been able to bring their own to the floor-- never. They talk about economic growth and jobs. This administration has a proud record of creating jobs. They haven't done all we want, but they are successful in important respects. This administration has had an energy policy that has really been working well, as can be seen by what has happened. There remain problems with it, and we will have some debate about where we go in the future. The problem is that the Republicans start from a premise that is grievously wrong. They are in denial of climate change, and everything they do relating to energy stems from that. They are out of step with the American people. A recent Gallup Poll showed this: 64 percent of Americans are worried a great deal or a fair amount about global warming. Fifty-nine percent of Americans say the effects of global warming have already begun. Only 10 percent of Americans say the effects of global warming will never happen--only 10 percent. Sixty-five percent of Americans, according to this Gallup Poll of recent times, say our planet's temperature increases over the last 100 years are primarily caused by human activities rather than natural causes. {time} 1030 But what do we hear from the now-leading Republican? Well, going back a few years, this is what he had to say: ``The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.'' That was 4 years ago, more or less. Now the same person, who is now leading the Republican Party, says this: ``I am not a great believer in manmade climate change.'' ``If you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s, and now they have global warming, although now they don't know if they have global warming.'' So we have today, from the Republican majority, our two sense of Congress resolutions. What is really needed instead is for the Republican Party to come to their senses on climate change, like the vast majority of the American people. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), one of our many Members-- but this person in particular--who has devoted so much of his deep intelligence and his energy to this issue, and I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman be allowed to control the time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan. There was no objection. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a very important member of the House Ways and Means Committee and someone who has extensive private sector experience. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank my colleague, Dr. Boustany. Mr. Speaker, again, before we came on to the floor, we were in the Cloakroom talking about what the debate was going to be. And I thought the debate was going to be about what was actually happening today, and not a scientific debate, not a debate about what people believe or what they don't believe, but on the reality that the President proposed a $10 tax on a barrel of oil. That comes out to 25 cents per gallon at the pump. Now, what do I mean by that? What I am talking about is, when hardworking American taxpayers go to fill up their car or their truck, it is going to cost them 25 cents more per gallon. It also translates into everything that they put on their backs, that they put in their mouths. Every aspect of life is going to be increased. Now, keep in mind that, while there may be some kind of science that we want to turn this debate into, here are the facts: middle-income Americans and lower-income Americans have seen a drop in their wages--a significant drop in their wages. Last month, we saw that we have created one job for every 8,000 Americans. So we talk about today how we need to talk about climate change. No. Here is what we need to talk about: we need to talk about real change in the marketplace. We need to talk about how [[Page H3679]] we are hurting the American economy. We need to talk about how we are eliminating the ability of America to compete in a global economy--an economy that I just don't want to participate in but I think America should dominate. America is so blessed with so many assets. And while we worry about all the energy above, let's not forget all the energy below. Let's not forget what America's strongest card is to play, and that is energy self-sustainability. We are able to do that. Why in the world would anybody think that by adding $10 on a barrel of oil, somehow that is going to help the climate worldwide, when we know that we are the only ones proposing this? Other people around the world are looking and saying: I can't agree more with the President's ideas because we compete against the United States, and I would love to be on the shelf with a product that costs more than the one we are putting on the shelf. So America is hurting America. America's policies are hurting everyday Americans. And if we truly want to make America great again, let's make America great again for every single American. That is not a political aspiration; that is a responsibility in America's House, and that is the House of Representatives. Our sense that somehow this would be positive is absolutely wrongheaded and wrong thinking. It just doesn't work that way. Why would we sit here and debate this today? Because we know it is going to hurt every single hard-working American taxpayer. It is going to add to our cost of living. It is going to increase the cost of everything we consume. We are going to do it with the idea that somehow, the rest of the world will follow suit, and we know that they won't. What they will do is look at us and say: You know what? Let's take advantage of America's wrong-headedness. Let's make sure that we are able to buy up more of the market, the global market, because America continues to hurt itself and hurt its everyday citizens. My goodness. This is America's House of Representatives. We do not come here representing ourselves--we come here representing 705,687 Americans who live back in our districts. We do not come here just representing Republican policy and Republican agenda. We do not just come here representing Democrat policy and Democrat agenda. We come here representing America. And if we cannot get it through our heads that, at the end of the day, the policy that comes out of this town--a town that is a awash in prosperity, good jobs, great restaurants. I have never seen a town with more cranes in it. I am talking about industrial cranes. I would love some of my colleagues to walk back home with me and go into the cities, the towns, and the little villages that I represent. And you tell those people: things are really getting good; we are on the right stage; we are on the right trajectory; that we are going to become good again. But the question is: When? I would just suggest that--and I said this earlier--you cannot continue to put the burden of these policies--well-intended, though they may be--on the backs of hardworking American taxpayers, men and women who get up every day with one resolve and one resolve only, and that is to take care of their families, to build a better community, and to build a better life. Why in the world do we have to waste time debating something today that could be debated elsewhere? But we come here today with a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the President's ideas in his budget are absolutely wrong for every single American. We can debate these things later. But we have to come to agreement at some point here, that we just don't represent our parties--we represent people. That is far more important than any party that we represent. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman. Look, I have only been here 5 years. But I come out of the private sector. I never, ever thought I would be serving in Congress because I never, ever thought I would have to. I thought people would come here representing me and my family; my community, my State, and my Nation; and that they would do the right thing. And I don't say that they don't think they are doing the right thing. But at the end of the day, the final results don't look very good. In a Nation that is quickly approaching $20 trillion in debt and burdening every single American taxpayer with more and more cost of being here while not increasing their opportunity, I think we need to take a hard look, take a look in the mirror and understand that it all changes, it all starts with each of us. We can change this. We can make it better. But we can't make it better by putting a heavy burden on our taxpayers. It just doesn't make sense. As I said earlier, America can dominate a global economy. Just participating isn't enough. I would just suggest that that is all possible in a land that has been so graced by gifts from God that make it possible for us to do that. The only thing that can keep it from happening are policies coming out of Washington, D.C. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I always enjoy sharing the debate with my good friend from Butler, Pennsylvania, who cares passionately about this country. He has some, I think, great ideas. We often find areas that we can agree. I think even the issue that we are debating today could be an area where we could find agreement, because what the President is proposing is not to levy a fee and have the money burned up. The President is proposing a fee to fix America's damaged infrastructure. I know my friend from Butler cares passionately about the people who he represents. They are paying a tax today for poor infrastructure. The average American pays three times with annual damage to their cars than what this fee would be, if it were translated directly to a gas tax increase. I note that his State of Pennsylvania actually has imposed an oil franchise fee which is the equivalent of about another 9.5 cent increase. Pennsylvania did that because their infrastructure is damaged. Well, that is what we should have as part of this discussion today. Again, we have a cartoon proposal that assumes that there is just a barrel fee that is just a burden on the American public and not look at what the fee is for, what benefits would accrue if, again, we had actually had the Ways and Means Committee meet and discuss the legislation that was referred to us. We didn't have a hearing on this. One of the things I have pleaded with Ways and Means leadership for as long as I have been on the committee: Let's sit down and actually have meaningful discussions with the men and women who manage, design, build, and operate America's infrastructure. If we would have had that debate in this Congress, we could have had arrayed before us the president of the AFL-CIO, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the president--actually, we did have the president of the American Trucking Association, the one witness the Democrats were allowed, who said: Raise the tax on my people, along with everybody else, to rebuild and renew America. But we never had a robust, broad debate before our committee. If we did, we would have had the broadest coalition of any major issue that we considered: the people who design roads, the people who come forward with the asphalt, and the people who are the delivery services. We are paying a tremendous price today because America is falling apart and falling behind. You don't have to go very far to ask people in Louisiana; Portland, Oregon; or Houston, Texas, if we have got a problem. This is an investment that more than pays for itself. Again, this isn't money down some rat hole. This is money that would be invested to rebuild and renew America. If we would have had a real hearing on this proposal--which we didn't--we could have had the people from Standard & Poor's research come in and review their report. Every $1.2 billion we spend on infrastructure creates $2 billion of economic activity. These are the people who would have family-wage [[Page H3680]] jobs from coast to coast who would help revitalize local economies, while we make our infrastructure safer and more effective. And it isn't just economic activity. That Standard & Poor's report would have revealed that that $1.2 billion in infrastructure would have reduced the deficit by $200 million, but we didn't have that debate. So we have people coming up here on the floor somehow claiming that the President's responsible proposal to fund infrastructure would be an economic disaster, ignoring the fact that we have an infrastructure crisis in this country right now. The American Society of Civil Engineers points out that our failure to deal with this is a tax of over $3,000 per family. If we would be honest, have independent experts, if the committee would do its job, we wouldn't be having bizarre debates like this that suggest that the President's proposal would hurt the economy or would be costly. To the contrary, it would strengthen the economy, put millions of people to work at family-wage jobs, and improve the conditions of families from coast to coast. We are going to have, I hope, more heard about this in the future. But I hope that we don't have proposals that are rushed to the floor without thoughtful committee action and making strange assertions that simply are not supported by facts. {time} 1045 If we impose the fee that the President is talking about to rebuild and renew America, it will create more economic activity, it will put people to work, and it will give Americans the infrastructure they deserve and enhance our economic security at home and abroad. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to respond to something before I yield to my colleague. Let me just say that I appreciate the gentleman's passion for transportation infrastructure. I share it. We have had many conversations. But he well knows that the ideal way to solve this is with a specific user fee for that purpose. This particular tax, $10.25 on a barrel of oil, has such a huge detrimental economic impact across all sectors of our economy. That is not the way to go. That is why I don't think this is something we should entertain as the President has proposed. I think we need thoughtful discussion about this, and that will come in due time. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and someone I have great respect for. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I appreciate him bringing this up. Mr. Speaker, I really regret the fact that this has devolved into a big partisan debate or a big partisan discussion. Everyone in this Chamber supports the concept of infrastructure investment. That is not what this is about. That is not what this is about. All of us support infrastructure investment, and all of us agree that we have underfunded infrastructure, that we need more investment in infrastructure. In my home State, in Baton Rouge, in the capital region, we have the worst traffic in the Nation for a midsize city. Our people sit in traffic an average of 47 hours above the national average at home. It is ridiculous. Here is what is going on right now. Here is what is going on. The gas tax was set up to be a user fee. It was set up to be a user fee that the more you drove, the more you used the roads, the more you paid for it. That is the way that this is supposed to work. What has happened is that the President has come out and offered a proposal that disconnects the user fee. We support a user fee model. We support lock-boxing the dollars and making sure that they are dedicated to infrastructure as opposed to what has happened, for example, another issue that the sponsor of this legislation has worked on--the harbor maintenance trust fund--where billions of dollars have been charged on the auspices of one thing and diverted to something else. We support infrastructure investment. Now, what is going on right now is we are seeing this continuation of policies out of this administration that is contrary to American interests, and I want to explain that. You see, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Oregon State probably--and I haven't verified this--but probably depended upon the State of Louisiana, one of the top producers of oil and gas in this country, to power their cars, to power their vehicles, and to power their airplanes that they fly back and forth from Washington, D.C., to the West Coast. We provide that. But at home, in our State of Louisiana, we have lost one-third of our oil and gas jobs. We are killing this industry because of overregulation. Something that just shocks me is, last year, we listened to the Secretary of State, John Kerry, stand up and say: We need to allow Iran to export their oil so their economy can recover. Our Secretary of State said that. Yet, at the same time, at home, in Louisiana, we were prohibited from exporting our oil. Why in the world would we treat Iran better than Louisiana, better than Texas, better than Oklahoma, and all of these energy-producing States across the United States? So do you know what we did? After opposition from the White House, we finally lifted the 40-year-old oil export ban. So what happens? Within a month and a half, we get a proposal from the President to put a $10.25-a-barrel tax on American oil. What does that do? If we try and take our oil out to global markets, we are immediately met with a premium of 30 to 40 percent over global prices. It further kills our industry. It further kills our domestic production that we have lost one-third of the jobs on. And I know everybody wants to see us fly solar airplanes. It is not happening right now. We need to continue to rely on these fuels moving forward. This should not be a partisan debate. We support infrastructure investment. It needs to continue to be a user fee. We should not divorce it from a user fee, and we should not do it in a way that is going to kill our energy industry in the United States to further increase our reliance upon foreign energy sources. It is a flawed policy. This is consistent with what we saw last year when the President of the United States was standing up and saying, ``Give us free trade authority. We need the ability to engage in free trade because we can outcompete other countries,'' and, at the exact same time, standing up and overregulating our economy to where we send American workers out there in the workforce trying to compete with these other countries with our arms tied behind our back. These policies aren't consistent, and they are not in the interest of the United States. I agree with the gentleman from Oregon; we need to work together. We need to work together in a bipartisan manner to come up with a new user fee concept to get us additional dollars for infrastructure. This was a unilateral proposal. This was not subject to hearings, and it is not appropriate. It is contrary to our economy; it is contrary to American interests; and it is going to increase our trade deficit. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge that we support this legislation and that we move forward in a bipartisan manner to fix the user fee concept to increase the investment in infrastructure to where we can improve our roadways. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Louisiana and his assessment. Actually, I agree with him. We should have a different mechanism. I have had proposals to have different approaches to funding infrastructure. Some of them have been embedded in the more recent transportation reauthorization, but this is something that we never took up in our Ways and Means Committee. I have had legislation there for several Congresses. It is time for people to stop saying that they support infrastructure and then not work with us to figure out ways to fund it going forward. Mr. Speaker, there is nobody in Congress in my tenure who has done more to think about what we do for America's infrastructure. He has had many innovative proposals to fund infrastructure. He has been a tireless champion of it. He is the ranking Democrat [[Page H3681]] on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio). Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. Those watching or listening might be a little confused what this is about. It is about a meaningless piece of paper. It is called House Concurrent Resolution 112. It is expressing the sense of Congress that something that the President proposed is bad and they don't like it. Well, he proposed it and they are not going to take it up. Why are we wasting time debating something that they are not going to put on the schedule and isn't a reality? I don't know. Because they are trying to fill up time? It is not clear to me. What they are doing is continuing to avoid the discussion of how we are going to pay for America's infrastructure. Dwight David Eisenhower said, Let's have a user fee, a gas tax. The last time we increased the gas tax federally was 1993--18.4 cents a gallon. That figured out to be about 15 percent of every gallon you bought. I paid $2.50 a gallon in Oregon last weekend. The Federal tax is still 18.4 cents. That is about 7 percent per gallon, and those dollars are worth less. We are talking about what it is going to do to jobs if we have some sort of tax on oil that we use to pay for infrastructure. Let's talk about the other side where we can create one heck of a lot of jobs. Every penny for a gas tax, every penny, raises about $1.7 billion for the Federal trust fund. $1.7 billion, under the most conservative estimates, most conservative, is more than 25,000 jobs. So one penny, 25,000 jobs. But, no, we can't go there. I proposed we index the existing gas tax to inflation. No, we can't do that. All right. Didn't want to do that. I proposed that we tax the fraction of a barrel of oil that goes into taxable transportation uses, not manufacturing, not agriculture, not any of this other stuff that they are talking about. I put that proposal forward 7 years ago. I put it forward to my colleagues and to the White House. Now, the White House has burped out something different here--this more indiscriminate tax--which would go to other uses. The point is that there are thoughtful ways to approach this and pay for what we need. America is falling apart. 140,000 bridges nationwide--including the highest proportion in the State of Pennsylvania, by the way, which we heard from earlier--are in need of replacement or significant repair. Trucks are detouring around them. People are being detoured around them. There are potholed roads. Forty percent of the national highway system needs not just to be resurfaced, it needs to be dug up it has failed so badly. People are breaking their rims, blowing out tires, and damaging their cars. It is costing Americans a lot. People are locked in congestion because we are not dealing with the growth in traffic. And, oh, let's just look out just a little way outside the capital here to the worst example. We are killing people, killing people, on our transit systems unnecessarily because Congress has failed to partner with the cities of America and the rural areas who have transit. We have an $84 billion backlog to bring transit up to a state of good repair, not new transit options to get people out of their cars and help them deal with congestion to get around. $84 billion just so we are not killing people. And we are talking about, oh, we can't be competitive. Yeah, we are not competitive in the world economy. I go around talking about how we are now degraded. We used to have an infrastructure that was the envy of the world. And I talked about how we are becoming Third World. My colleague from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) criticized me very, very adamantly about that one day. I said, What do you mean, Earl, you know how bad it is? He said, No, no, that is insulting to Third World countries. They are investing a larger percentage of their gross domestic product in infrastructure than we are here in the United States of America. And that is true. So now I have taken to calling us Fourth World. We used to be the world's leader in infrastructure, and now we are vaulting over everybody, including places like Zimbabwe, to the back of the pack. Give me a break. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BLUMENAUER. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. DeFAZIO. And where is the discussion? It is no, no, no. No, can't have a barrel tax. No, can't increase the gas tax. No, can't index the gas tax. Oh, but we want to talk about a user fee. What user fee? Why are we wasting time on this? You are not going to bring it up. You are in charge. You set the agenda. Why are we passing a bill to say we are not going to take something up? I would be kind of embarrassed if I was in the majority and that is what I was wasting time on while people are trapped in traffic, while people are dying, because we can't maintain our transit systems. People are blowing out tires because we can't repair the roads. And, oh, we are all for infrastructure until it comes to paying for it. We passed a 5-year bill. We paid for it with phony money. We pretended that when we have private tax collection, that it will make money--private tax collection. Republicans have passed that twice before. It kind of pissed off the American people. And guess what, it lost money each time, and then we put it back in the IRS. But, no, this time it is going to make money and we are going to use it and pay for infrastructure. Give me a break. And the Federal Reserve makes that money and puts it in a reserve account with a computer. Let's take that money and spend it. Basically, you are just averting the real problem here, which is we need to have a serious discussion about how we are going to pay to build America's infrastructure and become a world leader again and be the envy of the world again. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind Members of the House to refrain from vulgarity in debate. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), my friend and colleague from across the Potomac River, who cares a great deal about environmental policy and infrastructure. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution and add my strong opposition to the resolution before, also. As I read the text of H. Con. Res. 89, whereas by whereas, I found myself in disagreement with virtually every alleged predictive statement. This resolution is framed as long-term economic wisdom, yet exemplifies short-term thinking and economic folly. A carbon tax should, in fact, increase the cost of fossil fuels, but will also accelerate the rapidly falling cost of all other fuels: solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, and perhaps even nuclear. A carbon tax absolutely must not fall hardest on the poor, the elderly, and those with fixed incomes. The best of the carbon tax plans, Representative Van Hollen's carbon cap and economic dividend, returns every dollar gathered by a carbon cap to every U.S. citizen with a Social Security number. This carbon cap is actually progressive, with a net increase in the disposable income for most Americans, and certainly our neediest citizens. This will be a net job creator. {time} 1100 The resolution suggests that jobs and businesses will move overseas and that a carbon tax will restrain economic growth. British Columbia instituted a carbon tax in July 2008, and over the following 5-year period, its GDP growth actually outpaced the rest of non-carbon-priced Canada. In one ``whereas,'' it states that U.S. energy policy should encourage private sector innovation and development, but nothing would stimulate and sustain such innovation as powerfully as would appropriate carbon pricing. Every manufacturer, perhaps every family, would continue to search out the best ways to minimize the costs of production and to maximize family welfare. We are resilient, creative, and adaptive. For a long time, conservative and liberal economists have agreed that a carbon tax is the most efficient and effective way to deal with climate change. [[Page H3682]] Let me quote from a recent letter from four conservative and libertarian leaders to Members of Congress: The least burdensome, most straightforward, and most market friendly means of addressing climate change is to price the risks imposed by greenhouse gas emissions via a tax. This would harness price signals, rather than regulations, to guide a market response. That is why carbon pricing has the support of free market economists, a majority of the global business community, and a large number of the largest multinational private oil and gas companies in the world. One of the policy issues that most divides our Congress is the debate on the appropriate level of governmental regulation. But to quote again from the same letter: An economy-wide carbon tax that replaces existing regulatory interventions could reduce the cost of climate policy and deregulate the economy. Jerry Taylor of the Niskanen Center wrote a paper called ``The Conservative Case for a Carbon Tax.'' He argues that, if conservative denial of climate science is grounded in ideological aversion to command-and-control regulation, as proposed in the EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan, conservatives should embrace and promote a revenue-neutral carbon tax as a more efficient, less burdensome, free market alternative. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose both resolutions as they are unwise, unnecessary, and of backward thinking. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, as I have no further requests for time, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I appreciate the opportunity for us to visit on this proposal today. I don't agree with the resolution by any stretch of the imagination, but at least it is an opportunity for us to have a little bit of the conversation that we should have been having all along. I enjoy debating with my good friend from Louisiana. I respect his intellect and his humor, and it is fun to do a little bit of this today. It would have been far better if we would have been able to do so in the context of a full committee hearing where we would have been able to dig deeply into these issues. For example, we could have had the Transportation Construction Coalition. I include in the Record a letter on this resolution, a letter which is dated June 9 of this year. June 9, 2016. Dear Representative: The House is scheduled to consider later this week a resolution opposing President Obama's proposal for a $10.25 per barrel of oil tax. While H. Con. Res. 112 makes many statements regarding an oil barrel tax, the resolution fails to mention the intent of the President's proposal is to generate resources to stabilize and grow federal surface transportation investment. The resolution also does not remind members that recurring Highway Trust Fund revenue shortfalls caused repeated disruptions to their state's transportation program over the past eight years. Since 2008, Congress has approved seven pieces of legislation transferring a total $143 billion in borrowed or General Fund revenue into the Highway Trust Fund to prevent cuts in federal highway and transit investment. Over that same period, the trust fund's permanent revenue deficit has led to 14 temporary extensions of the surface transportation programs and one short-term reauthorization bill. Furthermore, upon the expiration of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act at the end of FY 2020, the Congressional Budget Office projects the trust fund's average annual shortfall will grow to $18 billion. While the sincerity of the Obama Administration's proposal for a Highway Trust Fund solution is dubious given its release three months after the President signed the FAST Act into law, a per barrel oil tax of that magnitude would be a real and permanent solution. And its nexus to highway users as a revenue mechanism is far more honest than the budget gimmicks, deficit spending and burdens placed on non- transportation sectors of the economy that the Congress has deployed since 2008 to keep investment in the surface transportation programs essentially static. We certainly respect the right of members of Congress to disagree with the President's proposal, but it is incumbent upon anyone who does so to bring forward an alternative way to achieve the same objective. We strongly believe all potential revenue options should be on the table. Preliminarily disparaging one significant solution just makes it more difficult to resolve a problem that has plagued Congress for nearly a decade. Rather than making rhetorical statements about taxes five months before an election, Congress should be working in a bipartisan manner to ensure that a permanent mechanism to preserve and grow federal highway and public transportation investment is in place well before the U.S. Department of Transportation starts warning states of the next highway program shutdown. Sincerely, The Transportation Construction Coalition. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, they point out that the resolution fails to mention that the intent of the President's proposal is to generate resources to stabilize and grow Federal surface transportation investment. The resolution does not remind Members that the recurring Highway Trust Fund revenue shortfalls caused repeated disruptions to their States' transportation programs over the past eight years. We have had to have 14 temporary extensions of the Surface Transportation Act, and the only way we got the FAST Act passed, as my friend Congressman DeFazio pointed out, was with a series of budget gimmicks, not real solutions. At the end of 2020, when that legislation expires, we are going to face a $20 billion annual deficit. The per barrel oil tax of this magnitude, according to the Transportation Construction Coalition, would be a real and a permanent solution. We wouldn't be chasing our tails all the time. And its nexus to highway users as a revenue mechanism is far more honest than the budget gimmicks, deficit spending, and burdens placed on non- transportation sectors of the economy that Congress has deployed since 2008 to keep investment, essentially, static. They state that they believe all potential revenue options should be on the table, that it is incumbent upon anybody who wants to disagree with the President to bring forward an alternative way to meet the same objective, which, sadly, has not happened. We haven't even been able to discuss it in the Ways and Means Committee. They write: Preliminarily disparaging one significant solution just makes it more difficult to resolve a problem that has plagued Congress for more than a decade. Rather than making rhetorical statements about taxes 5 months before an election, Congress should be working in a bipartisan manner to ensure that a permanent mechanism to preserve and grow Federal highway and public transportation investment is in place well before the Department of Transportation starts warning States about the next program shutdown. I seldom read statements from other groups on the floor, but I couldn't have said it better myself. That is what we should be doing rather than this exercise today, which completely misses the point. This oil barrel fee may not be perfect, but it would go a long way toward solving the problem. It will put millions of Americans to work at family-wage jobs. It will create more economic activity than the cost of the program. For every $1.2 billion that it generates, it will generate $2 billion of economic activity, and it will reduce the deficit $200 million. If we had actually had the committee do a deep dive and spend a week in working on it, this would have been on the table, and I think we would have found wide areas of agreement. Rather than engaging in this exercise regarding H. Con. Res. 112, I would like to think of what Ronald Reagan did in 1982. The economy was pretty rocky in 1982. There were some contentious politics in Congress. Ronald Reagan, in his Thanksgiving Day speech on November 29, 1982, called on Congress to come back from their Thanksgiving recess and work together to more than double the Federal gas tax, because in one of the best speeches, frankly, I have ever heard anybody give, he pointed out the little cost to the American consumer would be more than offset by damage, for example, for a couple pair of shock absorbers. Congress reacted to President Reagan's call for a gas tax increase on a bipartisan basis. It more than doubled it. It added hundreds of thousands of jobs, and it improved the quality of life for Americans. It did so in keeping the bipartisan tradition surrounding infrastructure. Rather than this partisan partial debate, we ought to go back to the basics, follow Ronald Reagan's example, and have a spirited, comprehensive approach to solving the problem rather than tilting at straw men. I strongly urge the rejection of the resolution, but, more important, the rejection of this approach to continue to stick our heads in the sand and [[Page H3683]] avoid our responsibility to fund American infrastructure and to rebuild and renew this great country. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I appreciate the gentleman's passion and intellect, and we have had many conversations. We do agree that we have to fix our deplorable infrastructure, and he and I have worked on some of these things together; but I have to say this: When I was in medical school--and I am a heart surgeon and I have had years of medical training--one of the things we learned a long time ago in medicine was to avoid iatrogenic treatment, which is a fancy, Greek-derived word which means to avoid a treatment that makes the problem worse. That is what this $10.25 tax would do on a barrel of oil. I have often referred to that plaque above the Speaker's desk. It is a quote from Daniel Webster. The very first line of that reads: ``Let us develop the resources of our land.'' I think it goes beyond simple concepts of highway transportation. It is all the resources of our land. We should be embracing the energy revolution that has been unleashed by American innovation, not taxing it into oblivion, not overregulating it into oblivion. This has offered tremendous hope not only for Americans, but for the world over, to offer a new view of energy security, taking us away from the Iranian approach or the OPEC approach or a Russian view by which they hoard resources and use this for their own political purposes. America can reshape it by embracing this energy revolution, and we can grow the economy, create jobs, improve wages, and have the revenues to take care of our infrastructure. As the gentleman well knows, Ronald Reagan believed that a user fee was important, a specific user fee. I think he and I would both agree that a specific user fee is important for infrastructure. This is not a user fee. This is a detrimental tax on American competitiveness, on American jobs, on American wages, on American energy security, and it hits at the very foundation of our national security. It is the wrong way to go. It is an iatrogenic solution, a harmful solution. It is not pro-growth. We are not proud of the economic performance we have seen in recent months: 0.8 percent economic growth in the first quarter, only 38,000 non-farm jobs created last month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. That is deplorable. America must lead, and America can lead by embracing the energy revolution. Let's look at all of the impacts it will have across our entire economy, and then we can fashion specific solutions for transportation and infrastructure and for the other things we need to do. This is why I stand here. That is why I oppose this tax. That is why I think this debate was important, and that is why I think it is very important to go on record as opposing this very detrimental tax. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in opposition to H. Con. Res. 112, expressing the sense of Congress opposing the President's proposed $10 tax on every barrel of oil. During my time in Congress, I have represented all five major refineries and countless energy production firms in East Harris County. I know the importance of the domestically produced and refined oil to the U.S. economy. I also know the importance of a well-funded transportation system. Houston is growing rapidly and our transportation system needs to expand with our population. I stand in opposition to today's Sense of Congress because of this knowledge and experience. But to clarify, we shouldn't make things tougher on American companies and domestically-produced crude. I do not support a $10 dollar tax on our natural resources. I do not support a $10 dollar tax on wildcatters in West Texas, North Dakota or any other areas in the U.S. that supply crude to the Texas Gulf Coast. It is these companies that are responsible for the energy renaissance in the U.S. These entrepreneurs lowered our gas prices, reduced our foreign dependence and made the U.S. the largest producer of oil in the world. I do support a $10 dollar tax on imported oil from foreign sources. Imported oil from countries that may or may not be our friends does not benefit our national security or domestic economy. We should sharpen our competitive edge and expand our 21st century transportation system by taxing imported oil. I stand with our domestic companies, we should continue to produce and refine U.S. crude for the benefit of U.S. consumers and workers. But I stand in opposition of this overly expansive Sense of Congress and I ask my colleagues to do the same. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, putting a regressive tax on hardworking Americans is not the way to strengthen the economy, balance the budget, or create jobs. The President's proposed $10.25 per barrel tax on crude oil is an administrative grab to increase spending and tax a targeted industry. Thousands of jobs have been lost in these uncertain times for the oil and gas industry and impacted communities. Now is not the time to make matters worse for an important economic engine and slow an already weak economic recovery. The Obama Administration knows this tax would be passed down to American families. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service reported that this tax could increase the price of a gallon of gasoline by 25 cents--which is a 10 percent hike on today's prices. That would increase the cost of a wide range of goods for all consumers. The resolution before us takes a strong stand and makes perfectly clear that Congress will not allow the President's harmful tax to go forward. It also pushes for a tough review of the effects of ill-conceived tax proposals that target specific industries, as the President's tax does. We must ensure that tax policy decisions are made in a reasoned way that protects working families--rather than harms them in a single- minded hunt for revenue. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting House Concurrent Resolution 112 and voting for its passage. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today, the House of Representatives will consider H. Con. Res. 112--Expressing the sense of Congress opposing the President's proposed $10 tax on every barrel of oil. This unserious, nonbinding resolution is simply nothing more than a cynical Republican political messaging bill. Indeed, the resolution purposely fails to include that the proposal was a serious attempt by the President to finance the critical infrastructure needs our country most certainly requires. The energy industry is critical to the global economy. Unfortunately, the manner in which the majority has decided to have this discussion leaves little room for thought or earnest debate. For these reasons, I will vote Present, and will encourage my colleagues to continue to work in earnest to find a long-term, sustainable solution to move forward with putting Americans to work in building out our transportation needs. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Woodall). All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the concurrent resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3677-H3683] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS OPPOSING THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSED $10 TAX ON EVERY BARREL OF OIL Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 767, I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con.

The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the concurrent resolution is considered read. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: H. Con. Res. 112 Whereas raising revenue and spending money are powers reserved to Congress by the Constitution; Whereas according to global economists, the United States oil and gas industry is currently experiencing the worst industry decline since similar commodity price collapses in the 1980s and 1990s forced oil companies to slash payrolls and dividends; Whereas global oil production exceeds demand by more than one million barrels a day, and Iran has promised to provide an additional 500,000 barrels a day to the world market, now that several sanctions have been lifted after the recent implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action; Whereas the price of a barrel of oil is currently around $30, less than a third of the $90-plus it was selling for 18 months ago; which would mean the President's proposal would be equivalent to a 33.3 percent tax, making the United States Federal excise tax on oil the highest of any domestic product; Whereas this tax could translate into as much as an additional 25 cents on a gallon of gas, when the Federal tax on gasoline is currently 18.40 cents per gallon; Whereas the oil and gas industry accounts for significant employment and is an even more significant driver of investment spending and growth along the supply chain, ranging from aggregates to steelmaking and specialist equipment; Whereas more than 258,000 people employed in oil and gas extraction and support activities globally, including more than 100,000 across the United States, have lost their jobs since October 2014; Whereas every lost oil and gas job leads to an additional 3.43 jobs cut in other sectors; Whereas that means the 114,000 job losses in the oil and gas sector wiped out an additional 391,000 jobs in other sectors last year and sliced economic growth to about 2.1 percent from 2.6 percent; Whereas more layoffs are virtually certain in the months ahead in oil and gas production, as well as along the supply chain and in petroleum-dependent economies, as the continued price slump filters through to even less drilling activity; Whereas the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas has fallen from over 1,900 in October 2014, to 744 at the end of November 2015, and just 619 at the end of January 2016, according to oilfield services firm Baker Hughes; Whereas manufacturers, for example, announced 37,221 layoffs in the past 12 months; Whereas shipments of steel in the United States--used to make oil and gas pipelines--were down 11.4 percent through the first 11 months of 2015 and the industry announced more than 12,000 layoffs during the past year, according to the American Steel and Iron Institute; Whereas believing that oil companies will pay the fee with no effect on consumer prices requires also believing that the producers won't pass their increased cost on to refiners, who won't in turn pass their costs on to the public; in other words, requires suspending belief in basic economics; Whereas this tax could also put American oil companies, at a competitive disadvantage with foreign oil companies, as imported oil may not face the same treatment; Whereas the domestic midstream and downstream stages of oil and gas production will be at a competitive disadvantage to their global competitors due to a $10 higher cost for every barrel of oil; Whereas in combination with a stronger dollar, slowing growth in international markets, and an overaccumulation of inventories through much of the economy, the oil slump is creating headwinds for manufacturers, freight firms, and the wider economy; and Whereas the oil and natural gas industry anchors our economy in terms of jobs, economic activity, and even State and local tax revenue in a challenging price environment: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That Congress finds that-- (1) any new tax placed on the struggling oil and gas industry will further prevent growth and development throughout the sector and encourage additional layoffs; and (2) the effect of a $10 tax on each barrel of oil sold in the United States-- (A) would raise the price of oil, and by extension gasoline; and (B) would result in a decrease in the consumption of oil. SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) a new tax should not be placed on oil, and (2) in considering future policy, Congress should carefully review the detrimental impacts of placing any new taxes on any industry that has seen a slash in jobs, revenue, and production. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The concurrent resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. General Leave Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H. Con. Res. 112, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the Obama administration, in its budget proposal, proposed a $10.25 tax on each barrel of oil. This will severely harm America's already struggling energy industry, but it will have a very detrimental impact throughout the American economy, and that is why I introduced H. Con. Res. 112, sending a very clear message that Congress and the American people refuse to allow this administration to fund an environmental agenda on the backs of working families. It is pretty simple. At $10.25 per barrel of oil, this increase would not only add significantly to the cost of a gallon of gasoline at the pump, certainly disproportionately hurting fixed-income families, seniors, and so forth, it would also have a detrimental impact on job creation, on wages, and on the Nation's overall economic health. This also would effectively act as an export tax on oil, just as we opened up the door to export crude oil to allow American producers to have market access worldwide, just like our Iranian opponents worldwide currently have the luxury to do. Why would we tie up the hands of American energy producers and allow the Iranians and OPEC to dominate world markets? Wrong. Secondly, at a time when, in Louisiana and Texas and other States on the coast, we understand how important our environment, our economy and energy policies are, we are looking to use revenue sharing to help us rebuild coastline and marsh and replenish our beaches, the administration opposes this. They have listed that in their budget proposal. This tax is a tax on hardworking American families. It is a tax on American competitiveness; it is a tax on American innovation; it is a tax on our energy security; and it is a tax on the very foundation of our national security. Now, the oil and gas industry has watched as market conditions have changed because of slow growth globally--low demand and abundant supply thanks to American innovation, largely. We have seen the oil price drop from $115 a barrel in November of 2014 to as low as $27 a barrel in January 2016. Right now, prices are hovering around $48, $49, $50 a barrel. This industry is struggling. This is the industry that took us out of recession with job creation and economic growth. Now, I know in my home State of Louisiana, just last year, we lost 11,700 jobs alone in Louisiana in the oil and gas sector, 5,500 in my hometown of Lafayette alone. Even worse, globally, over 250,000 people have lost their jobs. Of course, if you look at what happened in the first quarter of this year, the revised statistics on economic growth, 0.8 percent. How is American business going to create value and jobs with that kind of growth, that kind of private sector growth? Not only that, just last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics release showed [[Page H3678]] 38,000 jobs created last month, the worst number since 2010. That is a terrible statistic, with real human dimensions. This tax will make it worse if it were to go forward. In fact, the Tax Foundation created an economic model to show the impact of a $10.25-per-barrel tax over 10 years; and what this would do, if implemented, an estimated 137,000 Americans in full-time employment in this sector would lose their jobs. It is important to remember that oil is used for a lot more than just gasoline in our automobiles. The U.S. Energy Information Administration points out that a quarter of a barrel of crude--a quarter of each barrel of crude oil--is used for nonfuel goods such as plastic, asphalt, dyes, lubricants, power plants, home heating, and other nontransportation uses. In fact, products throughout the American economy have, as their base ingredient, these fossil fuel ingredients. This tax, $10.25, will be passed on to those industries and consumers across this country. The oil and gas industry supports more than 9 million American jobs, and what happens through this industry and within this industry reverberates throughout our entire U.S. economy. But it is also important to look at what this proposal would do as we view it through a national security lens. American innovation, the energy renaissance we saw with shale exploration and hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, as well as new deepwater technology and better assessments of our reserves, has given us this tremendous opportunity to change global energy security away from an OPEC- or Russian-driven model, where state-owned enterprises control pricing and control supply, to an American view of energy security, which our allies desperately want. It is a view of energy security with diversity of supply sources, transparent pricing, open markets, a view of energy security globally, uniquely American, that would help economic growth globally and help so many countries that are struggling today, many currently in recession. But energy security is linked to our national security, and we have an opportunity to create a Western Hemisphere energy trading bloc based on these principles rather than an OPEC or a Russian model. This is an opportunity for America to change not only energy security, but the entire national security environment in a more pro-American way. This tax would really be a stab in the heart of that. It is the wrong thing to do. And, of course, this tax would increase the cost of domestic production, translating into higher prices for oil and all petroleum products, potentially eroding America's price competitiveness in the global marketplace. If the purpose of this proposal was to increase revenue, then I would say that the President should be, instead, pursuing sound energy policies consisting of embracing this energy sector, American energy production, one of the clearest examples of American exceptionalism, not an unfettered drastic tax increase. If you want to build roads, we need economic growth and sensible tax policies that will help us build out our transportation. According to a report released by the American Petroleum Institute, our energy producers could create 1 million new jobs in just 7 years and increase revenue to Federal and State governments by $800 billion by 2030 if we allow this energy sector to do its work responsibly. It is time for our Nation to fully embrace the vast opportunities unleashed by this U.S. energy renaissance. Let's embrace this new era of abundance. Let's embrace this new era of energy diplomacy that puts America in a strong position. It is time for the President to stop his relentless tax and regulatory assault on the oil and gas industry that is only worsening our economic problems. This resolution shows very clearly that Congress stands for job creation over a radical political agenda, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans don't like the President's budget proposal. They have never been able to bring their own to the floor-- never. They talk about economic growth and jobs. This administration has a proud record of creating jobs. They haven't done all we want, but they are successful in important respects. This administration has had an energy policy that has really been working well, as can be seen by what has happened. There remain problems with it, and we will have some debate about where we go in the future. The problem is that the Republicans start from a premise that is grievously wrong. They are in denial of climate change, and everything they do relating to energy stems from that. They are out of step with the American people. A recent Gallup Poll showed this: 64 percent of Americans are worried a great deal or a fair amount about global warming. Fifty-nine percent of Americans say the effects of global warming have already begun. Only 10 percent of Americans say the effects of global warming will never happen--only 10 percent. Sixty-five percent of Americans, according to this Gallup Poll of recent times, say our planet's temperature increases over the last 100 years are primarily caused by human activities rather than natural causes. {time} 1030 But what do we hear from the now-leading Republican? Well, going back a few years, this is what he had to say: ``The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.'' That was 4 years ago, more or less. Now the same person, who is now leading the Republican Party, says this: ``I am not a great believer in manmade climate change.'' ``If you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s, and now they have global warming, although now they don't know if they have global warming.'' So we have today, from the Republican majority, our two sense of Congress resolutions. What is really needed instead is for the Republican Party to come to their senses on climate change, like the vast majority of the American people. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), one of our many Members-- but this person in particular--who has devoted so much of his deep intelligence and his energy to this issue, and I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman be allowed to control the time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan. There was no objection. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a very important member of the House Ways and Means Committee and someone who has extensive private sector experience. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank my colleague, Dr. Boustany. Mr. Speaker, again, before we came on to the floor, we were in the Cloakroom talking about what the debate was going to be. And I thought the debate was going to be about what was actually happening today, and not a scientific debate, not a debate about what people believe or what they don't believe, but on the reality that the President proposed a $10 tax on a barrel of oil. That comes out to 25 cents per gallon at the pump. Now, what do I mean by that? What I am talking about is, when hardworking American taxpayers go to fill up their car or their truck, it is going to cost them 25 cents more per gallon. It also translates into everything that they put on their backs, that they put in their mouths. Every aspect of life is going to be increased. Now, keep in mind that, while there may be some kind of science that we want to turn this debate into, here are the facts: middle-income Americans and lower-income Americans have seen a drop in their wages--a significant drop in their wages. Last month, we saw that we have created one job for every 8,000 Americans. So we talk about today how we need to talk about climate change. No. Here is what we need to talk about: we need to talk about real change in the marketplace. We need to talk about how [[Page H3679]] we are hurting the American economy. We need to talk about how we are eliminating the ability of America to compete in a global economy--an economy that I just don't want to participate in but I think America should dominate. America is so blessed with so many assets. And while we worry about all the energy above, let's not forget all the energy below. Let's not forget what America's strongest card is to play, and that is energy self-sustainability. We are able to do that. Why in the world would anybody think that by adding $10 on a barrel of oil, somehow that is going to help the climate worldwide, when we know that we are the only ones proposing this? Other people around the world are looking and saying: I can't agree more with the President's ideas because we compete against the United States, and I would love to be on the shelf with a product that costs more than the one we are putting on the shelf. So America is hurting America. America's policies are hurting everyday Americans. And if we truly want to make America great again, let's make America great again for every single American. That is not a political aspiration; that is a responsibility in America's House, and that is the House of Representatives. Our sense that somehow this would be positive is absolutely wrongheaded and wrong thinking. It just doesn't work that way. Why would we sit here and debate this today? Because we know it is going to hurt every single hard-working American taxpayer. It is going to add to our cost of living. It is going to increase the cost of everything we consume. We are going to do it with the idea that somehow, the rest of the world will follow suit, and we know that they won't. What they will do is look at us and say: You know what? Let's take advantage of America's wrong-headedness. Let's make sure that we are able to buy up more of the market, the global market, because America continues to hurt itself and hurt its everyday citizens. My goodness. This is America's House of Representatives. We do not come here representing ourselves--we come here representing 705,687 Americans who live back in our districts. We do not come here just representing Republican policy and Republican agenda. We do not just come here representing Democrat policy and Democrat agenda. We come here representing America. And if we cannot get it through our heads that, at the end of the day, the policy that comes out of this town--a town that is a awash in prosperity, good jobs, great restaurants. I have never seen a town with more cranes in it. I am talking about industrial cranes. I would love some of my colleagues to walk back home with me and go into the cities, the towns, and the little villages that I represent. And you tell those people: things are really getting good; we are on the right stage; we are on the right trajectory; that we are going to become good again. But the question is: When? I would just suggest that--and I said this earlier--you cannot continue to put the burden of these policies--well-intended, though they may be--on the backs of hardworking American taxpayers, men and women who get up every day with one resolve and one resolve only, and that is to take care of their families, to build a better community, and to build a better life. Why in the world do we have to waste time debating something today that could be debated elsewhere? But we come here today with a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the President's ideas in his budget are absolutely wrong for every single American. We can debate these things later. But we have to come to agreement at some point here, that we just don't represent our parties--we represent people. That is far more important than any party that we represent. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman. Look, I have only been here 5 years. But I come out of the private sector. I never, ever thought I would be serving in Congress because I never, ever thought I would have to. I thought people would come here representing me and my family; my community, my State, and my Nation; and that they would do the right thing. And I don't say that they don't think they are doing the right thing. But at the end of the day, the final results don't look very good. In a Nation that is quickly approaching $20 trillion in debt and burdening every single American taxpayer with more and more cost of being here while not increasing their opportunity, I think we need to take a hard look, take a look in the mirror and understand that it all changes, it all starts with each of us. We can change this. We can make it better. But we can't make it better by putting a heavy burden on our taxpayers. It just doesn't make sense. As I said earlier, America can dominate a global economy. Just participating isn't enough. I would just suggest that that is all possible in a land that has been so graced by gifts from God that make it possible for us to do that. The only thing that can keep it from happening are policies coming out of Washington, D.C. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I always enjoy sharing the debate with my good friend from Butler, Pennsylvania, who cares passionately about this country. He has some, I think, great ideas. We often find areas that we can agree. I think even the issue that we are debating today could be an area where we could find agreement, because what the President is proposing is not to levy a fee and have the money burned up. The President is proposing a fee to fix America's damaged infrastructure. I know my friend from Butler cares passionately about the people who he represents. They are paying a tax today for poor infrastructure. The average American pays three times with annual damage to their cars than what this fee would be, if it were translated directly to a gas tax increase. I note that his State of Pennsylvania actually has imposed an oil franchise fee which is the equivalent of about another 9.5 cent increase. Pennsylvania did that because their infrastructure is damaged. Well, that is what we should have as part of this discussion today. Again, we have a cartoon proposal that assumes that there is just a barrel fee that is just a burden on the American public and not look at what the fee is for, what benefits would accrue if, again, we had actually had the Ways and Means Committee meet and discuss the legislation that was referred to us. We didn't have a hearing on this. One of the things I have pleaded with Ways and Means leadership for as long as I have been on the committee: Let's sit down and actually have meaningful discussions with the men and women who manage, design, build, and operate America's infrastructure. If we would have had that debate in this Congress, we could have had arrayed before us the president of the AFL-CIO, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the president--actually, we did have the president of the American Trucking Association, the one witness the Democrats were allowed, who said: Raise the tax on my people, along with everybody else, to rebuild and renew America. But we never had a robust, broad debate before our committee. If we did, we would have had the broadest coalition of any major issue that we considered: the people who design roads, the people who come forward with the asphalt, and the people who are the delivery services. We are paying a tremendous price today because America is falling apart and falling behind. You don't have to go very far to ask people in Louisiana; Portland, Oregon; or Houston, Texas, if we have got a problem. This is an investment that more than pays for itself. Again, this isn't money down some rat hole. This is money that would be invested to rebuild and renew America. If we would have had a real hearing on this proposal--which we didn't--we could have had the people from Standard & Poor's research come in and review their report. Every $1.2 billion we spend on infrastructure creates $2 billion of economic activity. These are the people who would have family-wage [[Page H3680]] jobs from coast to coast who would help revitalize local economies, while we make our infrastructure safer and more effective. And it isn't just economic activity. That Standard & Poor's report would have revealed that that $1.2 billion in infrastructure would have reduced the deficit by $200 million, but we didn't have that debate. So we have people coming up here on the floor somehow claiming that the President's responsible proposal to fund infrastructure would be an economic disaster, ignoring the fact that we have an infrastructure crisis in this country right now. The American Society of Civil Engineers points out that our failure to deal with this is a tax of over $3,000 per family. If we would be honest, have independent experts, if the committee would do its job, we wouldn't be having bizarre debates like this that suggest that the President's proposal would hurt the economy or would be costly. To the contrary, it would strengthen the economy, put millions of people to work at family-wage jobs, and improve the conditions of families from coast to coast. We are going to have, I hope, more heard about this in the future. But I hope that we don't have proposals that are rushed to the floor without thoughtful committee action and making strange assertions that simply are not supported by facts. {time} 1045 If we impose the fee that the President is talking about to rebuild and renew America, it will create more economic activity, it will put people to work, and it will give Americans the infrastructure they deserve and enhance our economic security at home and abroad. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to respond to something before I yield to my colleague. Let me just say that I appreciate the gentleman's passion for transportation infrastructure. I share it. We have had many conversations. But he well knows that the ideal way to solve this is with a specific user fee for that purpose. This particular tax, $10.25 on a barrel of oil, has such a huge detrimental economic impact across all sectors of our economy. That is not the way to go. That is why I don't think this is something we should entertain as the President has proposed. I think we need thoughtful discussion about this, and that will come in due time. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and someone I have great respect for. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I appreciate him bringing this up. Mr. Speaker, I really regret the fact that this has devolved into a big partisan debate or a big partisan discussion. Everyone in this Chamber supports the concept of infrastructure investment. That is not what this is about. That is not what this is about. All of us support infrastructure investment, and all of us agree that we have underfunded infrastructure, that we need more investment in infrastructure. In my home State, in Baton Rouge, in the capital region, we have the worst traffic in the Nation for a midsize city. Our people sit in traffic an average of 47 hours above the national average at home. It is ridiculous. Here is what is going on right now. Here is what is going on. The gas tax was set up to be a user fee. It was set up to be a user fee that the more you drove, the more you used the roads, the more you paid for it. That is the way that this is supposed to work. What has happened is that the President has come out and offered a proposal that disconnects the user fee. We support a user fee model. We support lock-boxing the dollars and making sure that they are dedicated to infrastructure as opposed to what has happened, for example, another issue that the sponsor of this legislation has worked on--the harbor maintenance trust fund--where billions of dollars have been charged on the auspices of one thing and diverted to something else. We support infrastructure investment. Now, what is going on right now is we are seeing this continuation of policies out of this administration that is contrary to American interests, and I want to explain that. You see, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Oregon State probably--and I haven't verified this--but probably depended upon the State of Louisiana, one of the top producers of oil and gas in this country, to power their cars, to power their vehicles, and to power their airplanes that they fly back and forth from Washington, D.C., to the West Coast. We provide that. But at home, in our State of Louisiana, we have lost one-third of our oil and gas jobs. We are killing this industry because of overregulation. Something that just shocks me is, last year, we listened to the Secretary of State, John Kerry, stand up and say: We need to allow Iran to export their oil so their economy can recover. Our Secretary of State said that. Yet, at the same time, at home, in Louisiana, we were prohibited from exporting our oil. Why in the world would we treat Iran better than Louisiana, better than Texas, better than Oklahoma, and all of these energy-producing States across the United States? So do you know what we did? After opposition from the White House, we finally lifted the 40-year-old oil export ban. So what happens? Within a month and a half, we get a proposal from the President to put a $10.25-a-barrel tax on American oil. What does that do? If we try and take our oil out to global markets, we are immediately met with a premium of 30 to 40 percent over global prices. It further kills our industry. It further kills our domestic production that we have lost one-third of the jobs on. And I know everybody wants to see us fly solar airplanes. It is not happening right now. We need to continue to rely on these fuels moving forward. This should not be a partisan debate. We support infrastructure investment. It needs to continue to be a user fee. We should not divorce it from a user fee, and we should not do it in a way that is going to kill our energy industry in the United States to further increase our reliance upon foreign energy sources. It is a flawed policy. This is consistent with what we saw last year when the President of the United States was standing up and saying, ``Give us free trade authority. We need the ability to engage in free trade because we can outcompete other countries,'' and, at the exact same time, standing up and overregulating our economy to where we send American workers out there in the workforce trying to compete with these other countries with our arms tied behind our back. These policies aren't consistent, and they are not in the interest of the United States. I agree with the gentleman from Oregon; we need to work together. We need to work together in a bipartisan manner to come up with a new user fee concept to get us additional dollars for infrastructure. This was a unilateral proposal. This was not subject to hearings, and it is not appropriate. It is contrary to our economy; it is contrary to American interests; and it is going to increase our trade deficit. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge that we support this legislation and that we move forward in a bipartisan manner to fix the user fee concept to increase the investment in infrastructure to where we can improve our roadways. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Louisiana and his assessment. Actually, I agree with him. We should have a different mechanism. I have had proposals to have different approaches to funding infrastructure. Some of them have been embedded in the more recent transportation reauthorization, but this is something that we never took up in our Ways and Means Committee. I have had legislation there for several Congresses. It is time for people to stop saying that they support infrastructure and then not work with us to figure out ways to fund it going forward. Mr. Speaker, there is nobody in Congress in my tenure who has done more to think about what we do for America's infrastructure. He has had many innovative proposals to fund infrastructure. He has been a tireless champion of it. He is the ranking Democrat [[Page H3681]] on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio). Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. Those watching or listening might be a little confused what this is about. It is about a meaningless piece of paper. It is called House Concurrent Resolution 112. It is expressing the sense of Congress that something that the President proposed is bad and they don't like it. Well, he proposed it and they are not going to take it up. Why are we wasting time debating something that they are not going to put on the schedule and isn't a reality? I don't know. Because they are trying to fill up time? It is not clear to me. What they are doing is continuing to avoid the discussion of how we are going to pay for America's infrastructure. Dwight David Eisenhower said, Let's have a user fee, a gas tax. The last time we increased the gas tax federally was 1993--18.4 cents a gallon. That figured out to be about 15 percent of every gallon you bought. I paid $2.50 a gallon in Oregon last weekend. The Federal tax is still 18.4 cents. That is about 7 percent per gallon, and those dollars are worth less. We are talking about what it is going to do to jobs if we have some sort of tax on oil that we use to pay for infrastructure. Let's talk about the other side where we can create one heck of a lot of jobs. Every penny for a gas tax, every penny, raises about $1.7 billion for the Federal trust fund. $1.7 billion, under the most conservative estimates, most conservative, is more than 25,000 jobs. So one penny, 25,000 jobs. But, no, we can't go there. I proposed we index the existing gas tax to inflation. No, we can't do that. All right. Didn't want to do that. I proposed that we tax the fraction of a barrel of oil that goes into taxable transportation uses, not manufacturing, not agriculture, not any of this other stuff that they are talking about. I put that proposal forward 7 years ago. I put it forward to my colleagues and to the White House. Now, the White House has burped out something different here--this more indiscriminate tax--which would go to other uses. The point is that there are thoughtful ways to approach this and pay for what we need. America is falling apart. 140,000 bridges nationwide--including the highest proportion in the State of Pennsylvania, by the way, which we heard from earlier--are in need of replacement or significant repair. Trucks are detouring around them. People are being detoured around them. There are potholed roads. Forty percent of the national highway system needs not just to be resurfaced, it needs to be dug up it has failed so badly. People are breaking their rims, blowing out tires, and damaging their cars. It is costing Americans a lot. People are locked in congestion because we are not dealing with the growth in traffic. And, oh, let's just look out just a little way outside the capital here to the worst example. We are killing people, killing people, on our transit systems unnecessarily because Congress has failed to partner with the cities of America and the rural areas who have transit. We have an $84 billion backlog to bring transit up to a state of good repair, not new transit options to get people out of their cars and help them deal with congestion to get around. $84 billion just so we are not killing people. And we are talking about, oh, we can't be competitive. Yeah, we are not competitive in the world economy. I go around talking about how we are now degraded. We used to have an infrastructure that was the envy of the world. And I talked about how we are becoming Third World. My colleague from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) criticized me very, very adamantly about that one day. I said, What do you mean, Earl, you know how bad it is? He said, No, no, that is insulting to Third World countries. They are investing a larger percentage of their gross domestic product in infrastructure than we are here in the United States of America. And that is true. So now I have taken to calling us Fourth World. We used to be the world's leader in infrastructure, and now we are vaulting over everybody, including places like Zimbabwe, to the back of the pack. Give me a break. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BLUMENAUER. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. DeFAZIO. And where is the discussion? It is no, no, no. No, can't have a barrel tax. No, can't increase the gas tax. No, can't index the gas tax. Oh, but we want to talk about a user fee. What user fee? Why are we wasting time on this? You are not going to bring it up. You are in charge. You set the agenda. Why are we passing a bill to say we are not going to take something up? I would be kind of embarrassed if I was in the majority and that is what I was wasting time on while people are trapped in traffic, while people are dying, because we can't maintain our transit systems. People are blowing out tires because we can't repair the roads. And, oh, we are all for infrastructure until it comes to paying for it. We passed a 5-year bill. We paid for it with phony money. We pretended that when we have private tax collection, that it will make money--private tax collection. Republicans have passed that twice before. It kind of pissed off the American people. And guess what, it lost money each time, and then we put it back in the IRS. But, no, this time it is going to make money and we are going to use it and pay for infrastructure. Give me a break. And the Federal Reserve makes that money and puts it in a reserve account with a computer. Let's take that money and spend it. Basically, you are just averting the real problem here, which is we need to have a serious discussion about how we are going to pay to build America's infrastructure and become a world leader again and be the envy of the world again. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind Members of the House to refrain from vulgarity in debate. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), my friend and colleague from across the Potomac River, who cares a great deal about environmental policy and infrastructure. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution and add my strong opposition to the resolution before, also. As I read the text of H. Con. Res. 89, whereas by whereas, I found myself in disagreement with virtually every alleged predictive statement. This resolution is framed as long-term economic wisdom, yet exemplifies short-term thinking and economic folly. A carbon tax should, in fact, increase the cost of fossil fuels, but will also accelerate the rapidly falling cost of all other fuels: solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, and perhaps even nuclear. A carbon tax absolutely must not fall hardest on the poor, the elderly, and those with fixed incomes. The best of the carbon tax plans, Representative Van Hollen's carbon cap and economic dividend, returns every dollar gathered by a carbon cap to every U.S. citizen with a Social Security number. This carbon cap is actually progressive, with a net increase in the disposable income for most Americans, and certainly our neediest citizens. This will be a net job creator. {time} 1100 The resolution suggests that jobs and businesses will move overseas and that a carbon tax will restrain economic growth. British Columbia instituted a carbon tax in July 2008, and over the following 5-year period, its GDP growth actually outpaced the rest of non-carbon-priced Canada. In one ``whereas,'' it states that U.S. energy policy should encourage private sector innovation and development, but nothing would stimulate and sustain such innovation as powerfully as would appropriate carbon pricing. Every manufacturer, perhaps every family, would continue to search out the best ways to minimize the costs of production and to maximize family welfare. We are resilient, creative, and adaptive. For a long time, conservative and liberal economists have agreed that a carbon tax is the most efficient and effective way to deal with climate change. [[Page H3682]] Let me quote from a recent letter from four conservative and libertarian leaders to Members of Congress: The least burdensome, most straightforward, and most market friendly means of addressing climate change is to price the risks imposed by greenhouse gas emissions via a tax. This would harness price signals, rather than regulations, to guide a market response. That is why carbon pricing has the support of free market economists, a majority of the global business community, and a large number of the largest multinational private oil and gas companies in the world. One of the policy issues that most divides our Congress is the debate on the appropriate level of governmental regulation. But to quote again from the same letter: An economy-wide carbon tax that replaces existing regulatory interventions could reduce the cost of climate policy and deregulate the economy. Jerry Taylor of the Niskanen Center wrote a paper called ``The Conservative Case for a Carbon Tax.'' He argues that, if conservative denial of climate science is grounded in ideological aversion to command-and-control regulation, as proposed in the EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan, conservatives should embrace and promote a revenue-neutral carbon tax as a more efficient, less burdensome, free market alternative. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose both resolutions as they are unwise, unnecessary, and of backward thinking. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, as I have no further requests for time, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I appreciate the opportunity for us to visit on this proposal today. I don't agree with the resolution by any stretch of the imagination, but at least it is an opportunity for us to have a little bit of the conversation that we should have been having all along. I enjoy debating with my good friend from Louisiana. I respect his intellect and his humor, and it is fun to do a little bit of this today. It would have been far better if we would have been able to do so in the context of a full committee hearing where we would have been able to dig deeply into these issues. For example, we could have had the Transportation Construction Coalition. I include in the Record a letter on this resolution, a letter which is dated June 9 of this year. June 9, 2016. Dear Representative: The House is scheduled to consider later this week a resolution opposing President Obama's proposal for a $10.25 per barrel of oil tax. While H. Con. Res. 112 makes many statements regarding an oil barrel tax, the resolution fails to mention the intent of the President's proposal is to generate resources to stabilize and grow federal surface transportation investment. The resolution also does not remind members that recurring Highway Trust Fund revenue shortfalls caused repeated disruptions to their state's transportation program over the past eight years. Since 2008, Congress has approved seven pieces of legislation transferring a total $143 billion in borrowed or General Fund revenue into the Highway Trust Fund to prevent cuts in federal highway and transit investment. Over that same period, the trust fund's permanent revenue deficit has led to 14 temporary extensions of the surface transportation programs and one short-term reauthorization bill. Furthermore, upon the expiration of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act at the end of FY 2020, the Congressional Budget Office projects the trust fund's average annual shortfall will grow to $18 billion. While the sincerity of the Obama Administration's proposal for a Highway Trust Fund solution is dubious given its release three months after the President signed the FAST Act into law, a per barrel oil tax of that magnitude would be a real and permanent solution. And its nexus to highway users as a revenue mechanism is far more honest than the budget gimmicks, deficit spending and burdens placed on non- transportation sectors of the economy that the Congress has deployed since 2008 to keep investment in the surface transportation programs essentially static. We certainly respect the right of members of Congress to disagree with the President's proposal, but it is incumbent upon anyone who does so to bring forward an alternative way to achieve the same objective. We strongly believe all potential revenue options should be on the table. Preliminarily disparaging one significant solution just makes it more difficult to resolve a problem that has plagued Congress for nearly a decade. Rather than making rhetorical statements about taxes five months before an election, Congress should be working in a bipartisan manner to ensure that a permanent mechanism to preserve and grow federal highway and public transportation investment is in place well before the U.S. Department of Transportation starts warning states of the next highway program shutdown. Sincerely, The Transportation Construction Coalition. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, they point out that the resolution fails to mention that the intent of the President's proposal is to generate resources to stabilize and grow Federal surface transportation investment. The resolution does not remind Members that the recurring Highway Trust Fund revenue shortfalls caused repeated disruptions to their States' transportation programs over the past eight years. We have had to have 14 temporary extensions of the Surface Transportation Act, and the only way we got the FAST Act passed, as my friend Congressman DeFazio pointed out, was with a series of budget gimmicks, not real solutions. At the end of 2020, when that legislation expires, we are going to face a $20 billion annual deficit. The per barrel oil tax of this magnitude, according to the Transportation Construction Coalition, would be a real and a permanent solution. We wouldn't be chasing our tails all the time. And its nexus to highway users as a revenue mechanism is far more honest than the budget gimmicks, deficit spending, and burdens placed on non- transportation sectors of the economy that Congress has deployed since 2008 to keep investment, essentially, static. They state that they believe all potential revenue options should be on the table, that it is incumbent upon anybody who wants to disagree with the President to bring forward an alternative way to meet the same objective, which, sadly, has not happened. We haven't even been able to discuss it in the Ways and Means Committee. They write: Preliminarily disparaging one significant solution just makes it more difficult to resolve a problem that has plagued Congress for more than a decade. Rather than making rhetorical statements about taxes 5 months before an election, Congress should be working in a bipartisan manner to ensure that a permanent mechanism to preserve and grow Federal highway and public transportation investment is in place well before the Department of Transportation starts warning States about the next program shutdown. I seldom read statements from other groups on the floor, but I couldn't have said it better myself. That is what we should be doing rather than this exercise today, which completely misses the point. This oil barrel fee may not be perfect, but it would go a long way toward solving the problem. It will put millions of Americans to work at family-wage jobs. It will create more economic activity than the cost of the program. For every $1.2 billion that it generates, it will generate $2 billion of economic activity, and it will reduce the deficit $200 million. If we had actually had the committee do a deep dive and spend a week in working on it, this would have been on the table, and I think we would have found wide areas of agreement. Rather than engaging in this exercise regarding H. Con. Res. 112, I would like to think of what Ronald Reagan did in 1982. The economy was pretty rocky in 1982. There were some contentious politics in Congress. Ronald Reagan, in his Thanksgiving Day speech on November 29, 1982, called on Congress to come back from their Thanksgiving recess and work together to more than double the Federal gas tax, because in one of the best speeches, frankly, I have ever heard anybody give, he pointed out the little cost to the American consumer would be more than offset by damage, for example, for a couple pair of shock absorbers. Congress reacted to President Reagan's call for a gas tax increase on a bipartisan basis. It more than doubled it. It added hundreds of thousands of jobs, and it improved the quality of life for Americans. It did so in keeping the bipartisan tradition surrounding infrastructure. Rather than this partisan partial debate, we ought to go back to the basics, follow Ronald Reagan's example, and have a spirited, comprehensive approach to solving the problem rather than tilting at straw men. I strongly urge the rejection of the resolution, but, more important, the rejection of this approach to continue to stick our heads in the sand and [[Page H3683]] avoid our responsibility to fund American infrastructure and to rebuild and renew this great country. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I appreciate the gentleman's passion and intellect, and we have had many conversations. We do agree that we have to fix our deplorable infrastructure, and he and I have worked on some of these things together; but I have to say this: When I was in medical school--and I am a heart surgeon and I have had years of medical training--one of the things we learned a long time ago in medicine was to avoid iatrogenic treatment, which is a fancy, Greek-derived word which means to avoid a treatment that makes the problem worse. That is what this $10.25 tax would do on a barrel of oil. I have often referred to that plaque above the Speaker's desk. It is a quote from Daniel Webster. The very first line of that reads: ``Let us develop the resources of our land.'' I think it goes beyond simple concepts of highway transportation. It is all the resources of our land. We should be embracing the energy revolution that has been unleashed by American innovation, not taxing it into oblivion, not overregulating it into oblivion. This has offered tremendous hope not only for Americans, but for the world over, to offer a new view of energy security, taking us away from the Iranian approach or the OPEC approach or a Russian view by which they hoard resources and use this for their own political purposes. America can reshape it by embracing this energy revolution, and we can grow the economy, create jobs, improve wages, and have the revenues to take care of our infrastructure. As the gentleman well knows, Ronald Reagan believed that a user fee was important, a specific user fee. I think he and I would both agree that a specific user fee is important for infrastructure. This is not a user fee. This is a detrimental tax on American competitiveness, on American jobs, on American wages, on American energy security, and it hits at the very foundation of our national security. It is the wrong way to go. It is an iatrogenic solution, a harmful solution. It is not pro-growth. We are not proud of the economic performance we have seen in recent months: 0.8 percent economic growth in the first quarter, only 38,000 non-farm jobs created last month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. That is deplorable. America must lead, and America can lead by embracing the energy revolution. Let's look at all of the impacts it will have across our entire economy, and then we can fashion specific solutions for transportation and infrastructure and for the other things we need to do. This is why I stand here. That is why I oppose this tax. That is why I think this debate was important, and that is why I think it is very important to go on record as opposing this very detrimental tax. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in opposition to H. Con. Res. 112, expressing the sense of Congress opposing the President's proposed $10 tax on every barrel of oil. During my time in Congress, I have represented all five major refineries and countless energy production firms in East Harris County. I know the importance of the domestically produced and refined oil to the U.S. economy. I also know the importance of a well-funded transportation system. Houston is growing rapidly and our transportation system needs to expand with our population. I stand in opposition to today's Sense of Congress because of this knowledge and experience. But to clarify, we shouldn't make things tougher on American companies and domestically-produced crude. I do not support a $10 dollar tax on our natural resources. I do not support a $10 dollar tax on wildcatters in West Texas, North Dakota or any other areas in the U.S. that supply crude to the Texas Gulf Coast. It is these companies that are responsible for the energy renaissance in the U.S. These entrepreneurs lowered our gas prices, reduced our foreign dependence and made the U.S. the largest producer of oil in the world. I do support a $10 dollar tax on imported oil from foreign sources. Imported oil from countries that may or may not be our friends does not benefit our national security or domestic economy. We should sharpen our competitive edge and expand our 21st century transportation system by taxing imported oil. I stand with our domestic companies, we should continue to produce and refine U.S. crude for the benefit of U.S. consumers and workers. But I stand in opposition of this overly expansive Sense of Congress and I ask my colleagues to do the same. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, putting a regressive tax on hardworking Americans is not the way to strengthen the economy, balance the budget, or create jobs. The President's proposed $10.25 per barrel tax on crude oil is an administrative grab to increase spending and tax a targeted industry. Thousands of jobs have been lost in these uncertain times for the oil and gas industry and impacted communities. Now is not the time to make matters worse for an important economic engine and slow an already weak economic recovery. The Obama Administration knows this tax would be passed down to American families. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service reported that this tax could increase the price of a gallon of gasoline by 25 cents--which is a 10 percent hike on today's prices. That would increase the cost of a wide range of goods for all consumers. The resolution before us takes a strong stand and makes perfectly clear that Congress will not allow the President's harmful tax to go forward. It also pushes for a tough review of the effects of ill-conceived tax proposals that target specific industries, as the President's tax does. We must ensure that tax policy decisions are made in a reasoned way that protects working families--rather than harms them in a single- minded hunt for revenue. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting House Concurrent Resolution 112 and voting for its passage. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today, the House of Representatives will consider H. Con. Res. 112--Expressing the sense of Congress opposing the President's proposed $10 tax on every barrel of oil. This unserious, nonbinding resolution is simply nothing more than a cynical Republican political messaging bill. Indeed, the resolution purposely fails to include that the proposal was a serious attempt by the President to finance the critical infrastructure needs our country most certainly requires. The energy industry is critical to the global economy. Unfortunately, the manner in which the majority has decided to have this discussion leaves little room for thought or earnest debate. For these reasons, I will vote Present, and will encourage my colleagues to continue to work in earnest to find a long-term, sustainable solution to move forward with putting Americans to work in building out our transportation needs. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Woodall). All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the concurrent resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3677-H3683] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS OPPOSING THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSED $10 TAX ON EVERY BARREL OF OIL Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 767, I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 112) expressing the sense of Congress opposing the President's proposed $10 tax on every barrel of oil, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the concurrent resolution is considered read. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: H. Con. Res. 112 Whereas raising revenue and spending money are powers reserved to Congress by the Constitution; Whereas according to global economists, the United States oil and gas industry is currently experiencing the worst industry decline since similar commodity price collapses in the 1980s and 1990s forced oil companies to slash payrolls and dividends; Whereas global oil production exceeds demand by more than one million barrels a day, and Iran has promised to provide an additional 500,000 barrels a day to the world market, now that several sanctions have been lifted after the recent implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action; Whereas the price of a barrel of oil is currently around $30, less than a third of the $90-plus it was selling for 18 months ago; which would mean the President's proposal would be equivalent to a 33.3 percent tax, making the United States Federal excise tax on oil the highest of any domestic product; Whereas this tax could translate into as much as an additional 25 cents on a gallon of gas, when the Federal tax on gasoline is currently 18.40 cents per gallon; Whereas the oil and gas industry accounts for significant employment and is an even more significant driver of investment spending and growth along the supply chain, ranging from aggregates to steelmaking and specialist equipment; Whereas more than 258,000 people employed in oil and gas extraction and support activities globally, including more than 100,000 across the United States, have lost their jobs since October 2014; Whereas every lost oil and gas job leads to an additional 3.43 jobs cut in other sectors; Whereas that means the 114,000 job losses in the oil and gas sector wiped out an additional 391,000 jobs in other sectors last year and sliced economic growth to about 2.1 percent from 2.6 percent; Whereas more layoffs are virtually certain in the months ahead in oil and gas production, as well as along the supply chain and in petroleum-dependent economies, as the continued price slump filters through to even less drilling activity; Whereas the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas has fallen from over 1,900 in October 2014, to 744 at the end of November 2015, and just 619 at the end of January 2016, according to oilfield services firm Baker Hughes; Whereas manufacturers, for example, announced 37,221 layoffs in the past 12 months; Whereas shipments of steel in the United States--used to make oil and gas pipelines--were down 11.4 percent through the first 11 months of 2015 and the industry announced more than 12,000 layoffs during the past year, according to the American Steel and Iron Institute; Whereas believing that oil companies will pay the fee with no effect on consumer prices requires also believing that the producers won't pass their increased cost on to refiners, who won't in turn pass their costs on to the public; in other words, requires suspending belief in basic economics; Whereas this tax could also put American oil companies, at a competitive disadvantage with foreign oil companies, as imported oil may not face the same treatment; Whereas the domestic midstream and downstream stages of oil and gas production will be at a competitive disadvantage to their global competitors due to a $10 higher cost for every barrel of oil; Whereas in combination with a stronger dollar, slowing growth in international markets, and an overaccumulation of inventories through much of the economy, the oil slump is creating headwinds for manufacturers, freight firms, and the wider economy; and Whereas the oil and natural gas industry anchors our economy in terms of jobs, economic activity, and even State and local tax revenue in a challenging price environment: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That Congress finds that-- (1) any new tax placed on the struggling oil and gas industry will further prevent growth and development throughout the sector and encourage additional layoffs; and (2) the effect of a $10 tax on each barrel of oil sold in the United States-- (A) would raise the price of oil, and by extension gasoline; and (B) would result in a decrease in the consumption of oil. SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) a new tax should not be placed on oil, and (2) in considering future policy, Congress should carefully review the detrimental impacts of placing any new taxes on any industry that has seen a slash in jobs, revenue, and production. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The concurrent resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. General Leave Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H. Con. Res. 112, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the Obama administration, in its budget proposal, proposed a $10.25 tax on each barrel of oil. This will severely harm America's already struggling energy industry, but it will have a very detrimental impact throughout the American economy, and that is why I introduced H. Con. Res. 112, sending a very clear message that Congress and the American people refuse to allow this administration to fund an environmental agenda on the backs of working families. It is pretty simple. At $10.25 per barrel of oil, this increase would not only add significantly to the cost of a gallon of gasoline at the pump, certainly disproportionately hurting fixed-income families, seniors, and so forth, it would also have a detrimental impact on job creation, on wages, and on the Nation's overall economic health. This also would effectively act as an export tax on oil, just as we opened up the door to export crude oil to allow American producers to have market access worldwide, just like our Iranian opponents worldwide currently have the luxury to do. Why would we tie up the hands of American energy producers and allow the Iranians and OPEC to dominate world markets? Wrong. Secondly, at a time when, in Louisiana and Texas and other States on the coast, we understand how important our environment, our economy and energy policies are, we are looking to use revenue sharing to help us rebuild coastline and marsh and replenish our beaches, the administration opposes this. They have listed that in their budget proposal. This tax is a tax on hardworking American families. It is a tax on American competitiveness; it is a tax on American innovation; it is a tax on our energy security; and it is a tax on the very foundation of our national security. Now, the oil and gas industry has watched as market conditions have changed because of slow growth globally--low demand and abundant supply thanks to American innovation, largely. We have seen the oil price drop from $115 a barrel in November of 2014 to as low as $27 a barrel in January 2016. Right now, prices are hovering around $48, $49, $50 a barrel. This industry is struggling. This is the industry that took us out of recession with job creation and economic growth. Now, I know in my home State of Louisiana, just last year, we lost 11,700 jobs alone in Louisiana in the oil and gas sector, 5,500 in my hometown of Lafayette alone. Even worse, globally, over 250,000 people have lost their jobs. Of course, if you look at what happened in the first quarter of this year, the revised statistics on economic growth, 0.8 percent. How is American business going to create value and jobs with that kind of growth, that kind of private sector growth? Not only that, just last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics release showed [[Page H3678]] 38,000 jobs created last month, the worst number since 2010. That is a terrible statistic, with real human dimensions. This tax will make it worse if it were to go forward. In fact, the Tax Foundation created an economic model to show the impact of a $10.25-per-barrel tax over 10 years; and what this would do, if implemented, an estimated 137,000 Americans in full-time employment in this sector would lose their jobs. It is important to remember that oil is used for a lot more than just gasoline in our automobiles. The U.S. Energy Information Administration points out that a quarter of a barrel of crude--a quarter of each barrel of crude oil--is used for nonfuel goods such as plastic, asphalt, dyes, lubricants, power plants, home heating, and other nontransportation uses. In fact, products throughout the American economy have, as their base ingredient, these fossil fuel ingredients. This tax, $10.25, will be passed on to those industries and consumers across this country. The oil and gas industry supports more than 9 million American jobs, and what happens through this industry and within this industry reverberates throughout our entire U.S. economy. But it is also important to look at what this proposal would do as we view it through a national security lens. American innovation, the energy renaissance we saw with shale exploration and hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, as well as new deepwater technology and better assessments of our reserves, has given us this tremendous opportunity to change global energy security away from an OPEC- or Russian-driven model, where state-owned enterprises control pricing and control supply, to an American view of energy security, which our allies desperately want. It is a view of energy security with diversity of supply sources, transparent pricing, open markets, a view of energy security globally, uniquely American, that would help economic growth globally and help so many countries that are struggling today, many currently in recession. But energy security is linked to our national security, and we have an opportunity to create a Western Hemisphere energy trading bloc based on these principles rather than an OPEC or a Russian model. This is an opportunity for America to change not only energy security, but the entire national security environment in a more pro-American way. This tax would really be a stab in the heart of that. It is the wrong thing to do. And, of course, this tax would increase the cost of domestic production, translating into higher prices for oil and all petroleum products, potentially eroding America's price competitiveness in the global marketplace. If the purpose of this proposal was to increase revenue, then I would say that the President should be, instead, pursuing sound energy policies consisting of embracing this energy sector, American energy production, one of the clearest examples of American exceptionalism, not an unfettered drastic tax increase. If you want to build roads, we need economic growth and sensible tax policies that will help us build out our transportation. According to a report released by the American Petroleum Institute, our energy producers could create 1 million new jobs in just 7 years and increase revenue to Federal and State governments by $800 billion by 2030 if we allow this energy sector to do its work responsibly. It is time for our Nation to fully embrace the vast opportunities unleashed by this U.S. energy renaissance. Let's embrace this new era of abundance. Let's embrace this new era of energy diplomacy that puts America in a strong position. It is time for the President to stop his relentless tax and regulatory assault on the oil and gas industry that is only worsening our economic problems. This resolution shows very clearly that Congress stands for job creation over a radical political agenda, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans don't like the President's budget proposal. They have never been able to bring their own to the floor-- never. They talk about economic growth and jobs. This administration has a proud record of creating jobs. They haven't done all we want, but they are successful in important respects. This administration has had an energy policy that has really been working well, as can be seen by what has happened. There remain problems with it, and we will have some debate about where we go in the future. The problem is that the Republicans start from a premise that is grievously wrong. They are in denial of climate change, and everything they do relating to energy stems from that. They are out of step with the American people. A recent Gallup Poll showed this: 64 percent of Americans are worried a great deal or a fair amount about global warming. Fifty-nine percent of Americans say the effects of global warming have already begun. Only 10 percent of Americans say the effects of global warming will never happen--only 10 percent. Sixty-five percent of Americans, according to this Gallup Poll of recent times, say our planet's temperature increases over the last 100 years are primarily caused by human activities rather than natural causes. {time} 1030 But what do we hear from the now-leading Republican? Well, going back a few years, this is what he had to say: ``The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.'' That was 4 years ago, more or less. Now the same person, who is now leading the Republican Party, says this: ``I am not a great believer in manmade climate change.'' ``If you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s, and now they have global warming, although now they don't know if they have global warming.'' So we have today, from the Republican majority, our two sense of Congress resolutions. What is really needed instead is for the Republican Party to come to their senses on climate change, like the vast majority of the American people. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), one of our many Members-- but this person in particular--who has devoted so much of his deep intelligence and his energy to this issue, and I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman be allowed to control the time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan. There was no objection. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a very important member of the House Ways and Means Committee and someone who has extensive private sector experience. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank my colleague, Dr. Boustany. Mr. Speaker, again, before we came on to the floor, we were in the Cloakroom talking about what the debate was going to be. And I thought the debate was going to be about what was actually happening today, and not a scientific debate, not a debate about what people believe or what they don't believe, but on the reality that the President proposed a $10 tax on a barrel of oil. That comes out to 25 cents per gallon at the pump. Now, what do I mean by that? What I am talking about is, when hardworking American taxpayers go to fill up their car or their truck, it is going to cost them 25 cents more per gallon. It also translates into everything that they put on their backs, that they put in their mouths. Every aspect of life is going to be increased. Now, keep in mind that, while there may be some kind of science that we want to turn this debate into, here are the facts: middle-income Americans and lower-income Americans have seen a drop in their wages--a significant drop in their wages. Last month, we saw that we have created one job for every 8,000 Americans. So we talk about today how we need to talk about climate change. No. Here is what we need to talk about: we need to talk about real change in the marketplace. We need to talk about how [[Page H3679]] we are hurting the American economy. We need to talk about how we are eliminating the ability of America to compete in a global economy--an economy that I just don't want to participate in but I think America should dominate. America is so blessed with so many assets. And while we worry about all the energy above, let's not forget all the energy below. Let's not forget what America's strongest card is to play, and that is energy self-sustainability. We are able to do that. Why in the world would anybody think that by adding $10 on a barrel of oil, somehow that is going to help the climate worldwide, when we know that we are the only ones proposing this? Other people around the world are looking and saying: I can't agree more with the President's ideas because we compete against the United States, and I would love to be on the shelf with a product that costs more than the one we are putting on the shelf. So America is hurting America. America's policies are hurting everyday Americans. And if we truly want to make America great again, let's make America great again for every single American. That is not a political aspiration; that is a responsibility in America's House, and that is the House of Representatives. Our sense that somehow this would be positive is absolutely wrongheaded and wrong thinking. It just doesn't work that way. Why would we sit here and debate this today? Because we know it is going to hurt every single hard-working American taxpayer. It is going to add to our cost of living. It is going to increase the cost of everything we consume. We are going to do it with the idea that somehow, the rest of the world will follow suit, and we know that they won't. What they will do is look at us and say: You know what? Let's take advantage of America's wrong-headedness. Let's make sure that we are able to buy up more of the market, the global market, because America continues to hurt itself and hurt its everyday citizens. My goodness. This is America's House of Representatives. We do not come here representing ourselves--we come here representing 705,687 Americans who live back in our districts. We do not come here just representing Republican policy and Republican agenda. We do not just come here representing Democrat policy and Democrat agenda. We come here representing America. And if we cannot get it through our heads that, at the end of the day, the policy that comes out of this town--a town that is a awash in prosperity, good jobs, great restaurants. I have never seen a town with more cranes in it. I am talking about industrial cranes. I would love some of my colleagues to walk back home with me and go into the cities, the towns, and the little villages that I represent. And you tell those people: things are really getting good; we are on the right stage; we are on the right trajectory; that we are going to become good again. But the question is: When? I would just suggest that--and I said this earlier--you cannot continue to put the burden of these policies--well-intended, though they may be--on the backs of hardworking American taxpayers, men and women who get up every day with one resolve and one resolve only, and that is to take care of their families, to build a better community, and to build a better life. Why in the world do we have to waste time debating something today that could be debated elsewhere? But we come here today with a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the President's ideas in his budget are absolutely wrong for every single American. We can debate these things later. But we have to come to agreement at some point here, that we just don't represent our parties--we represent people. That is far more important than any party that we represent. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman. Look, I have only been here 5 years. But I come out of the private sector. I never, ever thought I would be serving in Congress because I never, ever thought I would have to. I thought people would come here representing me and my family; my community, my State, and my Nation; and that they would do the right thing. And I don't say that they don't think they are doing the right thing. But at the end of the day, the final results don't look very good. In a Nation that is quickly approaching $20 trillion in debt and burdening every single American taxpayer with more and more cost of being here while not increasing their opportunity, I think we need to take a hard look, take a look in the mirror and understand that it all changes, it all starts with each of us. We can change this. We can make it better. But we can't make it better by putting a heavy burden on our taxpayers. It just doesn't make sense. As I said earlier, America can dominate a global economy. Just participating isn't enough. I would just suggest that that is all possible in a land that has been so graced by gifts from God that make it possible for us to do that. The only thing that can keep it from happening are policies coming out of Washington, D.C. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I always enjoy sharing the debate with my good friend from Butler, Pennsylvania, who cares passionately about this country. He has some, I think, great ideas. We often find areas that we can agree. I think even the issue that we are debating today could be an area where we could find agreement, because what the President is proposing is not to levy a fee and have the money burned up. The President is proposing a fee to fix America's damaged infrastructure. I know my friend from Butler cares passionately about the people who he represents. They are paying a tax today for poor infrastructure. The average American pays three times with annual damage to their cars than what this fee would be, if it were translated directly to a gas tax increase. I note that his State of Pennsylvania actually has imposed an oil franchise fee which is the equivalent of about another 9.5 cent increase. Pennsylvania did that because their infrastructure is damaged. Well, that is what we should have as part of this discussion today. Again, we have a cartoon proposal that assumes that there is just a barrel fee that is just a burden on the American public and not look at what the fee is for, what benefits would accrue if, again, we had actually had the Ways and Means Committee meet and discuss the legislation that was referred to us. We didn't have a hearing on this. One of the things I have pleaded with Ways and Means leadership for as long as I have been on the committee: Let's sit down and actually have meaningful discussions with the men and women who manage, design, build, and operate America's infrastructure. If we would have had that debate in this Congress, we could have had arrayed before us the president of the AFL-CIO, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the president--actually, we did have the president of the American Trucking Association, the one witness the Democrats were allowed, who said: Raise the tax on my people, along with everybody else, to rebuild and renew America. But we never had a robust, broad debate before our committee. If we did, we would have had the broadest coalition of any major issue that we considered: the people who design roads, the people who come forward with the asphalt, and the people who are the delivery services. We are paying a tremendous price today because America is falling apart and falling behind. You don't have to go very far to ask people in Louisiana; Portland, Oregon; or Houston, Texas, if we have got a problem. This is an investment that more than pays for itself. Again, this isn't money down some rat hole. This is money that would be invested to rebuild and renew America. If we would have had a real hearing on this proposal--which we didn't--we could have had the people from Standard & Poor's research come in and review their report. Every $1.2 billion we spend on infrastructure creates $2 billion of economic activity. These are the people who would have family-wage [[Page H3680]] jobs from coast to coast who would help revitalize local economies, while we make our infrastructure safer and more effective. And it isn't just economic activity. That Standard & Poor's report would have revealed that that $1.2 billion in infrastructure would have reduced the deficit by $200 million, but we didn't have that debate. So we have people coming up here on the floor somehow claiming that the President's responsible proposal to fund infrastructure would be an economic disaster, ignoring the fact that we have an infrastructure crisis in this country right now. The American Society of Civil Engineers points out that our failure to deal with this is a tax of over $3,000 per family. If we would be honest, have independent experts, if the committee would do its job, we wouldn't be having bizarre debates like this that suggest that the President's proposal would hurt the economy or would be costly. To the contrary, it would strengthen the economy, put millions of people to work at family-wage jobs, and improve the conditions of families from coast to coast. We are going to have, I hope, more heard about this in the future. But I hope that we don't have proposals that are rushed to the floor without thoughtful committee action and making strange assertions that simply are not supported by facts. {time} 1045 If we impose the fee that the President is talking about to rebuild and renew America, it will create more economic activity, it will put people to work, and it will give Americans the infrastructure they deserve and enhance our economic security at home and abroad. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to respond to something before I yield to my colleague. Let me just say that I appreciate the gentleman's passion for transportation infrastructure. I share it. We have had many conversations. But he well knows that the ideal way to solve this is with a specific user fee for that purpose. This particular tax, $10.25 on a barrel of oil, has such a huge detrimental economic impact across all sectors of our economy. That is not the way to go. That is why I don't think this is something we should entertain as the President has proposed. I think we need thoughtful discussion about this, and that will come in due time. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and someone I have great respect for. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I appreciate him bringing this up. Mr. Speaker, I really regret the fact that this has devolved into a big partisan debate or a big partisan discussion. Everyone in this Chamber supports the concept of infrastructure investment. That is not what this is about. That is not what this is about. All of us support infrastructure investment, and all of us agree that we have underfunded infrastructure, that we need more investment in infrastructure. In my home State, in Baton Rouge, in the capital region, we have the worst traffic in the Nation for a midsize city. Our people sit in traffic an average of 47 hours above the national average at home. It is ridiculous. Here is what is going on right now. Here is what is going on. The gas tax was set up to be a user fee. It was set up to be a user fee that the more you drove, the more you used the roads, the more you paid for it. That is the way that this is supposed to work. What has happened is that the President has come out and offered a proposal that disconnects the user fee. We support a user fee model. We support lock-boxing the dollars and making sure that they are dedicated to infrastructure as opposed to what has happened, for example, another issue that the sponsor of this legislation has worked on--the harbor maintenance trust fund--where billions of dollars have been charged on the auspices of one thing and diverted to something else. We support infrastructure investment. Now, what is going on right now is we are seeing this continuation of policies out of this administration that is contrary to American interests, and I want to explain that. You see, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Oregon State probably--and I haven't verified this--but probably depended upon the State of Louisiana, one of the top producers of oil and gas in this country, to power their cars, to power their vehicles, and to power their airplanes that they fly back and forth from Washington, D.C., to the West Coast. We provide that. But at home, in our State of Louisiana, we have lost one-third of our oil and gas jobs. We are killing this industry because of overregulation. Something that just shocks me is, last year, we listened to the Secretary of State, John Kerry, stand up and say: We need to allow Iran to export their oil so their economy can recover. Our Secretary of State said that. Yet, at the same time, at home, in Louisiana, we were prohibited from exporting our oil. Why in the world would we treat Iran better than Louisiana, better than Texas, better than Oklahoma, and all of these energy-producing States across the United States? So do you know what we did? After opposition from the White House, we finally lifted the 40-year-old oil export ban. So what happens? Within a month and a half, we get a proposal from the President to put a $10.25-a-barrel tax on American oil. What does that do? If we try and take our oil out to global markets, we are immediately met with a premium of 30 to 40 percent over global prices. It further kills our industry. It further kills our domestic production that we have lost one-third of the jobs on. And I know everybody wants to see us fly solar airplanes. It is not happening right now. We need to continue to rely on these fuels moving forward. This should not be a partisan debate. We support infrastructure investment. It needs to continue to be a user fee. We should not divorce it from a user fee, and we should not do it in a way that is going to kill our energy industry in the United States to further increase our reliance upon foreign energy sources. It is a flawed policy. This is consistent with what we saw last year when the President of the United States was standing up and saying, ``Give us free trade authority. We need the ability to engage in free trade because we can outcompete other countries,'' and, at the exact same time, standing up and overregulating our economy to where we send American workers out there in the workforce trying to compete with these other countries with our arms tied behind our back. These policies aren't consistent, and they are not in the interest of the United States. I agree with the gentleman from Oregon; we need to work together. We need to work together in a bipartisan manner to come up with a new user fee concept to get us additional dollars for infrastructure. This was a unilateral proposal. This was not subject to hearings, and it is not appropriate. It is contrary to our economy; it is contrary to American interests; and it is going to increase our trade deficit. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge that we support this legislation and that we move forward in a bipartisan manner to fix the user fee concept to increase the investment in infrastructure to where we can improve our roadways. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Louisiana and his assessment. Actually, I agree with him. We should have a different mechanism. I have had proposals to have different approaches to funding infrastructure. Some of them have been embedded in the more recent transportation reauthorization, but this is something that we never took up in our Ways and Means Committee. I have had legislation there for several Congresses. It is time for people to stop saying that they support infrastructure and then not work with us to figure out ways to fund it going forward. Mr. Speaker, there is nobody in Congress in my tenure who has done more to think about what we do for America's infrastructure. He has had many innovative proposals to fund infrastructure. He has been a tireless champion of it. He is the ranking Democrat [[Page H3681]] on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio). Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. Those watching or listening might be a little confused what this is about. It is about a meaningless piece of paper. It is called House Concurrent Resolution 112. It is expressing the sense of Congress that something that the President proposed is bad and they don't like it. Well, he proposed it and they are not going to take it up. Why are we wasting time debating something that they are not going to put on the schedule and isn't a reality? I don't know. Because they are trying to fill up time? It is not clear to me. What they are doing is continuing to avoid the discussion of how we are going to pay for America's infrastructure. Dwight David Eisenhower said, Let's have a user fee, a gas tax. The last time we increased the gas tax federally was 1993--18.4 cents a gallon. That figured out to be about 15 percent of every gallon you bought. I paid $2.50 a gallon in Oregon last weekend. The Federal tax is still 18.4 cents. That is about 7 percent per gallon, and those dollars are worth less. We are talking about what it is going to do to jobs if we have some sort of tax on oil that we use to pay for infrastructure. Let's talk about the other side where we can create one heck of a lot of jobs. Every penny for a gas tax, every penny, raises about $1.7 billion for the Federal trust fund. $1.7 billion, under the most conservative estimates, most conservative, is more than 25,000 jobs. So one penny, 25,000 jobs. But, no, we can't go there. I proposed we index the existing gas tax to inflation. No, we can't do that. All right. Didn't want to do that. I proposed that we tax the fraction of a barrel of oil that goes into taxable transportation uses, not manufacturing, not agriculture, not any of this other stuff that they are talking about. I put that proposal forward 7 years ago. I put it forward to my colleagues and to the White House. Now, the White House has burped out something different here--this more indiscriminate tax--which would go to other uses. The point is that there are thoughtful ways to approach this and pay for what we need. America is falling apart. 140,000 bridges nationwide--including the highest proportion in the State of Pennsylvania, by the way, which we heard from earlier--are in need of replacement or significant repair. Trucks are detouring around them. People are being detoured around them. There are potholed roads. Forty percent of the national highway system needs not just to be resurfaced, it needs to be dug up it has failed so badly. People are breaking their rims, blowing out tires, and damaging their cars. It is costing Americans a lot. People are locked in congestion because we are not dealing with the growth in traffic. And, oh, let's just look out just a little way outside the capital here to the worst example. We are killing people, killing people, on our transit systems unnecessarily because Congress has failed to partner with the cities of America and the rural areas who have transit. We have an $84 billion backlog to bring transit up to a state of good repair, not new transit options to get people out of their cars and help them deal with congestion to get around. $84 billion just so we are not killing people. And we are talking about, oh, we can't be competitive. Yeah, we are not competitive in the world economy. I go around talking about how we are now degraded. We used to have an infrastructure that was the envy of the world. And I talked about how we are becoming Third World. My colleague from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) criticized me very, very adamantly about that one day. I said, What do you mean, Earl, you know how bad it is? He said, No, no, that is insulting to Third World countries. They are investing a larger percentage of their gross domestic product in infrastructure than we are here in the United States of America. And that is true. So now I have taken to calling us Fourth World. We used to be the world's leader in infrastructure, and now we are vaulting over everybody, including places like Zimbabwe, to the back of the pack. Give me a break. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BLUMENAUER. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. DeFAZIO. And where is the discussion? It is no, no, no. No, can't have a barrel tax. No, can't increase the gas tax. No, can't index the gas tax. Oh, but we want to talk about a user fee. What user fee? Why are we wasting time on this? You are not going to bring it up. You are in charge. You set the agenda. Why are we passing a bill to say we are not going to take something up? I would be kind of embarrassed if I was in the majority and that is what I was wasting time on while people are trapped in traffic, while people are dying, because we can't maintain our transit systems. People are blowing out tires because we can't repair the roads. And, oh, we are all for infrastructure until it comes to paying for it. We passed a 5-year bill. We paid for it with phony money. We pretended that when we have private tax collection, that it will make money--private tax collection. Republicans have passed that twice before. It kind of pissed off the American people. And guess what, it lost money each time, and then we put it back in the IRS. But, no, this time it is going to make money and we are going to use it and pay for infrastructure. Give me a break. And the Federal Reserve makes that money and puts it in a reserve account with a computer. Let's take that money and spend it. Basically, you are just averting the real problem here, which is we need to have a serious discussion about how we are going to pay to build America's infrastructure and become a world leader again and be the envy of the world again. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind Members of the House to refrain from vulgarity in debate. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), my friend and colleague from across the Potomac River, who cares a great deal about environmental policy and infrastructure. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution and add my strong opposition to the resolution before, also. As I read the text of H. Con. Res. 89, whereas by whereas, I found myself in disagreement with virtually every alleged predictive statement. This resolution is framed as long-term economic wisdom, yet exemplifies short-term thinking and economic folly. A carbon tax should, in fact, increase the cost of fossil fuels, but will also accelerate the rapidly falling cost of all other fuels: solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, and perhaps even nuclear. A carbon tax absolutely must not fall hardest on the poor, the elderly, and those with fixed incomes. The best of the carbon tax plans, Representative Van Hollen's carbon cap and economic dividend, returns every dollar gathered by a carbon cap to every U.S. citizen with a Social Security number. This carbon cap is actually progressive, with a net increase in the disposable income for most Americans, and certainly our neediest citizens. This will be a net job creator. {time} 1100 The resolution suggests that jobs and businesses will move overseas and that a carbon tax will restrain economic growth. British Columbia instituted a carbon tax in July 2008, and over the following 5-year period, its GDP growth actually outpaced the rest of non-carbon-priced Canada. In one ``whereas,'' it states that U.S. energy policy should encourage private sector innovation and development, but nothing would stimulate and sustain such innovation as powerfully as would appropriate carbon pricing. Every manufacturer, perhaps every family, would continue to search out the best ways to minimize the costs of production and to maximize family welfare. We are resilient, creative, and adaptive. For a long time, conservative and liberal economists have agreed that a carbon tax is the most efficient and effective way to deal with climate change. [[Page H3682]] Let me quote from a recent letter from four conservative and libertarian leaders to Members of Congress: The least burdensome, most straightforward, and most market friendly means of addressing climate change is to price the risks imposed by greenhouse gas emissions via a tax. This would harness price signals, rather than regulations, to guide a market response. That is why carbon pricing has the support of free market economists, a majority of the global business community, and a large number of the largest multinational private oil and gas companies in the world. One of the policy issues that most divides our Congress is the debate on the appropriate level of governmental regulation. But to quote again from the same letter: An economy-wide carbon tax that replaces existing regulatory interventions could reduce the cost of climate policy and deregulate the economy. Jerry Taylor of the Niskanen Center wrote a paper called ``The Conservative Case for a Carbon Tax.'' He argues that, if conservative denial of climate science is grounded in ideological aversion to command-and-control regulation, as proposed in the EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan, conservatives should embrace and promote a revenue-neutral carbon tax as a more efficient, less burdensome, free market alternative. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose both resolutions as they are unwise, unnecessary, and of backward thinking. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, as I have no further requests for time, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I appreciate the opportunity for us to visit on this proposal today. I don't agree with the resolution by any stretch of the imagination, but at least it is an opportunity for us to have a little bit of the conversation that we should have been having all along. I enjoy debating with my good friend from Louisiana. I respect his intellect and his humor, and it is fun to do a little bit of this today. It would have been far better if we would have been able to do so in the context of a full committee hearing where we would have been able to dig deeply into these issues. For example, we could have had the Transportation Construction Coalition. I include in the Record a letter on this resolution, a letter which is dated June 9 of this year. June 9, 2016. Dear Representative: The House is scheduled to consider later this week a resolution opposing President Obama's proposal for a $10.25 per barrel of oil tax. While H. Con. Res. 112 makes many statements regarding an oil barrel tax, the resolution fails to mention the intent of the President's proposal is to generate resources to stabilize and grow federal surface transportation investment. The resolution also does not remind members that recurring Highway Trust Fund revenue shortfalls caused repeated disruptions to their state's transportation program over the past eight years. Since 2008, Congress has approved seven pieces of legislation transferring a total $143 billion in borrowed or General Fund revenue into the Highway Trust Fund to prevent cuts in federal highway and transit investment. Over that same period, the trust fund's permanent revenue deficit has led to 14 temporary extensions of the surface transportation programs and one short-term reauthorization bill. Furthermore, upon the expiration of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act at the end of FY 2020, the Congressional Budget Office projects the trust fund's average annual shortfall will grow to $18 billion. While the sincerity of the Obama Administration's proposal for a Highway Trust Fund solution is dubious given its release three months after the President signed the FAST Act into law, a per barrel oil tax of that magnitude would be a real and permanent solution. And its nexus to highway users as a revenue mechanism is far more honest than the budget gimmicks, deficit spending and burdens placed on non- transportation sectors of the economy that the Congress has deployed since 2008 to keep investment in the surface transportation programs essentially static. We certainly respect the right of members of Congress to disagree with the President's proposal, but it is incumbent upon anyone who does so to bring forward an alternative way to achieve the same objective. We strongly believe all potential revenue options should be on the table. Preliminarily disparaging one significant solution just makes it more difficult to resolve a problem that has plagued Congress for nearly a decade. Rather than making rhetorical statements about taxes five months before an election, Congress should be working in a bipartisan manner to ensure that a permanent mechanism to preserve and grow federal highway and public transportation investment is in place well before the U.S. Department of Transportation starts warning states of the next highway program shutdown. Sincerely, The Transportation Construction Coalition. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, they point out that the resolution fails to mention that the intent of the President's proposal is to generate resources to stabilize and grow Federal surface transportation investment. The resolution does not remind Members that the recurring Highway Trust Fund revenue shortfalls caused repeated disruptions to their States' transportation programs over the past eight years. We have had to have 14 temporary extensions of the Surface Transportation Act, and the only way we got the FAST Act passed, as my friend Congressman DeFazio pointed out, was with a series of budget gimmicks, not real solutions. At the end of 2020, when that legislation expires, we are going to face a $20 billion annual deficit. The per barrel oil tax of this magnitude, according to the Transportation Construction Coalition, would be a real and a permanent solution. We wouldn't be chasing our tails all the time. And its nexus to highway users as a revenue mechanism is far more honest than the budget gimmicks, deficit spending, and burdens placed on non- transportation sectors of the economy that Congress has deployed since 2008 to keep investment, essentially, static. They state that they believe all potential revenue options should be on the table, that it is incumbent upon anybody who wants to disagree with the President to bring forward an alternative way to meet the same objective, which, sadly, has not happened. We haven't even been able to discuss it in the Ways and Means Committee. They write: Preliminarily disparaging one significant solution just makes it more difficult to resolve a problem that has plagued Congress for more than a decade. Rather than making rhetorical statements about taxes 5 months before an election, Congress should be working in a bipartisan manner to ensure that a permanent mechanism to preserve and grow Federal highway and public transportation investment is in place well before the Department of Transportation starts warning States about the next program shutdown. I seldom read statements from other groups on the floor, but I couldn't have said it better myself. That is what we should be doing rather than this exercise today, which completely misses the point. This oil barrel fee may not be perfect, but it would go a long way toward solving the problem. It will put millions of Americans to work at family-wage jobs. It will create more economic activity than the cost of the program. For every $1.2 billion that it generates, it will generate $2 billion of economic activity, and it will reduce the deficit $200 million. If we had actually had the committee do a deep dive and spend a week in working on it, this would have been on the table, and I think we would have found wide areas of agreement. Rather than engaging in this exercise regarding H. Con. Res. 112, I would like to think of what Ronald Reagan did in 1982. The economy was pretty rocky in 1982. There were some contentious politics in Congress. Ronald Reagan, in his Thanksgiving Day speech on November 29, 1982, called on Congress to come back from their Thanksgiving recess and work together to more than double the Federal gas tax, because in one of the best speeches, frankly, I have ever heard anybody give, he pointed out the little cost to the American consumer would be more than offset by damage, for example, for a couple pair of shock absorbers. Congress reacted to President Reagan's call for a gas tax increase on a bipartisan basis. It more than doubled it. It added hundreds of thousands of jobs, and it improved the quality of life for Americans. It did so in keeping the bipartisan tradition surrounding infrastructure. Rather than this partisan partial debate, we ought to go back to the basics, follow Ronald Reagan's example, and have a spirited, comprehensive approach to solving the problem rather than tilting at straw men. I strongly urge the rejection of the resolution, but, more important, the rejection of this approach to continue to stick our heads in the sand and [[Page H3683]] avoid our responsibility to fund American infrastructure and to rebuild and renew this great country. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I appreciate the gentleman's passion and intellect, and we have had many conversations. We do agree that we have to fix our deplorable infrastructure, and he and I have worked on some of these things together; but I have to say this: When I was in medical school--and I am a heart surgeon and I have had years of medical training--one of the things we learned a long time ago in medicine was to avoid iatrogenic treatment, which is a fancy, Greek-derived word which means to avoid a treatment that makes the problem worse. That is what this $10.25 tax would do on a barrel of oil. I have often referred to that plaque above the Speaker's desk. It is a quote from Daniel Webster. The very first line of that reads: ``Let us develop the resources of our land.'' I think it goes beyond simple concepts of highway transportation. It is all the resources of our land. We should be embracing the energy revolution that has been unleashed by American innovation, not taxing it into oblivion, not overregulating it into oblivion. This has offered tremendous hope not only for Americans, but for the world over, to offer a new view of energy security, taking us away from the Iranian approach or the OPEC approach or a Russian view by which they hoard resources and use this for their own political purposes. America can reshape it by embracing this energy revolution, and we can grow the economy, create jobs, improve wages, and have the revenues to take care of our infrastructure. As the gentleman well knows, Ronald Reagan believed that a user fee was important, a specific user fee. I think he and I would both agree that a specific user fee is important for infrastructure. This is not a user fee. This is a detrimental tax on American competitiveness, on American jobs, on American wages, on American energy security, and it hits at the very foundation of our national security. It is the wrong way to go. It is an iatrogenic solution, a harmful solution. It is not pro-growth. We are not proud of the economic performance we have seen in recent months: 0.8 percent economic growth in the first quarter, only 38,000 non-farm jobs created last month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. That is deplorable. America must lead, and America can lead by embracing the energy revolution. Let's look at all of the impacts it will have across our entire economy, and then we can fashion specific solutions for transportation and infrastructure and for the other things we need to do. This is why I stand here. That is why I oppose this tax. That is why I think this debate was important, and that is why I think it is very important to go on record as opposing this very detrimental tax. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in opposition to H. Con. Res. 112, expressing the sense of Congress opposing the President's proposed $10 tax on every barrel of oil. During my time in Congress, I have represented all five major refineries and countless energy production firms in East Harris County. I know the importance of the domestically produced and refined oil to the U.S. economy. I also know the importance of a well-funded transportation system. Houston is growing rapidly and our transportation system needs to expand with our population. I stand in opposition to today's Sense of Congress because of this knowledge and experience. But to clarify, we shouldn't make things tougher on American companies and domestically-produced crude. I do not support a $10 dollar tax on our natural resources. I do not support a $10 dollar tax on wildcatters in West Texas, North Dakota or any other areas in the U.S. that supply crude to the Texas Gulf Coast. It is these companies that are responsible for the energy renaissance in the U.S. These entrepreneurs lowered our gas prices, reduced our foreign dependence and made the U.S. the largest producer of oil in the world. I do support a $10 dollar tax on imported oil from foreign sources. Imported oil from countries that may or may not be our friends does not benefit our national security or domestic economy. We should sharpen our competitive edge and expand our 21st century transportation system by taxing imported oil. I stand with our domestic companies, we should continue to produce and refine U.S. crude for the benefit of U.S. consumers and workers. But I stand in opposition of this overly expansive Sense of Congress and I ask my colleagues to do the same. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, putting a regressive tax on hardworking Americans is not the way to strengthen the economy, balance the budget, or create jobs. The President's proposed $10.25 per barrel tax on crude oil is an administrative grab to increase spending and tax a targeted industry. Thousands of jobs have been lost in these uncertain times for the oil and gas industry and impacted communities. Now is not the time to make matters worse for an important economic engine and slow an already weak economic recovery. The Obama Administration knows this tax would be passed down to American families. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service reported that this tax could increase the price of a gallon of gasoline by 25 cents--which is a 10 percent hike on today's prices. That would increase the cost of a wide range of goods for all consumers. The resolution before us takes a strong stand and makes perfectly clear that Congress will not allow the President's harmful tax to go forward. It also pushes for a tough review of the effects of ill-conceived tax proposals that target specific industries, as the President's tax does. We must ensure that tax policy decisions are made in a reasoned way that protects working families--rather than harms them in a single- minded hunt for revenue. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting House Concurrent Resolution 112 and voting for its passage. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today, the House of Representatives will consider H. Con. Res. 112--Expressing the sense of Congress opposing the President's proposed $10 tax on every barrel of oil. This unserious, nonbinding resolution is simply nothing more than a cynical Republican political messaging bill. Indeed, the resolution purposely fails to include that the proposal was a serious attempt by the President to finance the critical infrastructure needs our country most certainly requires. The energy industry is critical to the global economy. Unfortunately, the manner in which the majority has decided to have this discussion leaves little room for thought or earnest debate. For these reasons, I will vote Present, and will encourage my colleagues to continue to work in earnest to find a long-term, sustainable solution to move forward with putting Americans to work in building out our transportation needs. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Woodall). All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the concurrent resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_182.csv,58224,58224,58290,"[congressional record volume 162, number 92 (friday, june 10, 2016)] [house] [pages h3677-h3683] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] expressing the sense of congress opposing the president's proposed $10 tax on every barrel of oil mr. boustany. mr. speaker, pursuant to house resolution 767, i call up the concurrent resolution (h. con. res. 112) expressing the sense of congress opposing the president's proposed $10 tax on every barrel of oil, and ask for its immediate consideration in the house. the clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 767, the concurrent resolution is considered read. the text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: h. con. res. 112 whereas raising revenue and spending money are powers reserved to congress by the constitution; whereas according to global economists, the united states oil and gas industry is currently experiencing the worst industry decline since similar commodity price collapses in the 1980s and 1990s forced oil companies to slash payrolls and dividends; whereas global oil production exceeds demand by more than one million barrels a day, and iran has promised to provide an additional 500,000 barrels a day to the world market, now that several sanctions have been lifted after the recent implementation of the joint comprehensive plan of action; whereas the price of a barrel of oil is currently around $30, less than a third of the $90-plus it was selling for 18 months ago; which would mean the president's proposal would be equivalent to a 33.3 percent tax, making the united states federal excise tax on oil the highest of any domestic product; whereas this tax could translate into as much as an additional 25 cents on a gallon of gas, when the federal tax on gasoline is currently 18.40 cents per gallon; whereas the oil and gas industry accounts for significant employment and is an even more significant driver of investment spending and growth along the supply chain, ranging from aggregates to steelmaking and specialist equipment; whereas more than 258,000 people employed in oil and gas extraction and support activities globally, including more than 100,000 across the united states, have lost their jobs since october 2014; whereas every lost oil and gas job leads to an additional 3.43 jobs cut in other sectors; whereas that means the 114,000 job losses in the oil and gas sector wiped out an additional 391,000 jobs in other sectors last year and sliced economic growth to about 2.1 percent from 2.6 percent; whereas more layoffs are virtually certain in the months ahead in oil and gas production, as well as along the supply chain and in petroleum-dependent economies, as the continued price slump filters through to even less drilling activity; whereas the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas has fallen from over 1,900 in october 2014, to 744 at the end of november 2015, and just 619 at the end of january 2016, according to oilfield services firm baker hughes; whereas manufacturers, for example, announced 37,221 layoffs in the past 12 months; whereas shipments of steel in the united states--used to make oil and gas pipelines--were down 11.4 percent through the first 11 months of 2015 and the industry announced more than 12,000 layoffs during the past year, according to the american steel and iron institute; whereas believing that oil companies will pay the fee with no effect on consumer prices requires also believing that the producers won't pass their increased cost on to refiners, who won't in turn pass their costs on to the public; in other words, requires suspending belief in basic economics; whereas this tax could also put american oil companies, at a competitive disadvantage with foreign oil companies, as imported oil may not face the same treatment; whereas the domestic midstream and downstream stages of oil and gas production will be at a competitive disadvantage to their global competitors due to a $10 higher cost for every barrel of oil; whereas in combination with a stronger dollar, slowing growth in international markets, and an overaccumulation of inventories through much of the economy, the oil slump is creating headwinds for manufacturers, freight firms, and the wider economy; and whereas the oil and natural gas industry anchors our economy in terms of jobs, economic activity, and even state and local tax revenue in a challenging price environment: now, therefore, be it resolved by the house of representatives (the senate concurring), that congress finds that-- (1) any new tax placed on the struggling oil and gas industry will further prevent growth and development throughout the sector and encourage additional layoffs; and (2) the effect of a $10 tax on each barrel of oil sold in the united states-- (a) would raise the price of oil, and by extension gasoline; and (b) would result in a decrease in the consumption of oil. sec. 2. sense of congress. it is the sense of congress that-- (1) a new tax should not be placed on oil, and (2) in considering future policy, congress should carefully review the detrimental impacts of placing any new taxes on any industry that has seen a slash in jobs, revenue, and production. the speaker pro tempore. the concurrent resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means. the gentleman from louisiana (mr. boustany) and the gentleman from michigan (mr. levin) each will control 30 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from louisiana. general leave mr. boustany. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on h. con. res. 112, currently under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from louisiana? there was no objection. mr. boustany. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, earlier this year, the obama administration, in its budget proposal, proposed a $10.25 tax on each barrel of oil. this will severely harm america's already struggling energy industry, but it will have a very detrimental impact throughout the american economy, and that is why i introduced h. con. res. 112, sending a very clear message that congress and the american people refuse to allow this administration to fund an environmental agenda on the backs of working families. it is pretty simple. at $10.25 per barrel of oil, this increase would not only add significantly to the cost of a gallon of gasoline at the pump, certainly disproportionately hurting fixed-income families, seniors, and so forth, it would also have a detrimental impact on job creation, on wages, and on the nation's overall economic health. this also would effectively act as an export tax on oil, just as we opened up the door to export crude oil to allow american producers to have market access worldwide, just like our iranian opponents worldwide currently have the luxury to do. why would we tie up the hands of american energy producers and allow the iranians and opec to dominate world markets? wrong. secondly, at a time when, in louisiana and texas and other states on the coast, we understand how important our environment, our economy and energy policies are, we are looking to use revenue sharing to help us rebuild coastline and marsh and replenish our beaches, the administration opposes this. they have listed that in their budget proposal. this tax is a tax on hardworking american families. it is a tax on american competitiveness; it is a tax on american innovation; it is a tax on our energy security; and it is a tax on the very foundation of our national security. now, the oil and gas industry has watched as market conditions have changed because of slow growth globally--low demand and abundant supply thanks to american innovation, largely. we have seen the oil price drop from $115 a barrel in november of 2014 to as low as $27 a barrel in january 2016. right now, prices are hovering around $48, $49, $50 a barrel. this industry is struggling. this is the industry that took us out of recession with job creation and economic growth. now, i know in my home state of louisiana, just last year, we lost 11,700 jobs alone in louisiana in the oil and gas sector, 5,500 in my hometown of lafayette alone. even worse, globally, over 250,000 people have lost their jobs. of course, if you look at what happened in the first quarter of this year, the revised statistics on economic growth, 0.8 percent. how is american business going to create value and jobs with that kind of growth, that kind of private sector growth? not only that, just last week, the bureau of labor statistics release showed [[page h3678]] 38,000 jobs created last month, the worst number since 2010. that is a terrible statistic, with real human dimensions. this tax will make it worse if it were to go forward. in fact, the tax foundation created an economic model to show the impact of a $10.25-per-barrel tax over 10 years; and what this would do, if implemented, an estimated 137,000 americans in full-time employment in this sector would lose their jobs. it is important to remember that oil is used for a lot more than just gasoline in our automobiles. the u.s. energy information administration points out that a quarter of a barrel of crude--a quarter of each barrel of crude oil--is used for nonfuel goods such as plastic, asphalt, dyes, lubricants, power plants, home heating, and other nontransportation uses. in fact, products throughout the american economy have, as their base ingredient, these fossil fuel ingredients. this tax, $10.25, will be passed on to those industries and consumers across this country. the oil and gas industry supports more than 9 million american jobs, and what happens through this industry and within this industry reverberates throughout our entire u.s. economy. but it is also important to look at what this proposal would do as we view it through a national security lens. american innovation, the energy renaissance we saw with shale exploration and hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, as well as new deepwater technology and better assessments of our reserves, has given us this tremendous opportunity to change global energy security away from an opec- or russian-driven model, where state-owned enterprises control pricing and control supply, to an american view of energy security, which our allies desperately want. it is a view of energy security with diversity of supply sources, transparent pricing, open markets, a view of energy security globally, uniquely american, that would help economic growth globally and help so many countries that are struggling today, many currently in recession. but energy security is linked to our national security, and we have an opportunity to create a western hemisphere energy trading bloc based on these principles rather than an opec or a russian model. this is an opportunity for america to change not only energy security, but the entire national security environment in a more pro-american way. this tax would really be a stab in the heart of that. it is the wrong thing to do. and, of course, this tax would increase the cost of domestic production, translating into higher prices for oil and all petroleum products, potentially eroding america's price competitiveness in the global marketplace. if the purpose of this proposal was to increase revenue, then i would say that the president should be, instead, pursuing sound energy policies consisting of embracing this energy sector, american energy production, one of the clearest examples of american exceptionalism, not an unfettered drastic tax increase. if you want to build roads, we need economic growth and sensible tax policies that will help us build out our transportation. according to a report released by the american petroleum institute, our energy producers could create 1 million new jobs in just 7 years and increase revenue to federal and state governments by $800 billion by 2030 if we allow this energy sector to do its work responsibly. it is time for our nation to fully embrace the vast opportunities unleashed by this u.s. energy renaissance. let's embrace this new era of abundance. let's embrace this new era of energy diplomacy that puts america in a strong position. it is time for the president to stop his relentless tax and regulatory assault on the oil and gas industry that is only worsening our economic problems. this resolution shows very clearly that congress stands for job creation over a radical political agenda, and i urge my colleagues to support this resolution. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. levin. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, the republicans don't like the president's budget proposal. they have never been able to bring their own to the floor-- never. they talk about economic growth and jobs. this administration has a proud record of creating jobs. they haven't done all we want, but they are successful in important respects. this administration has had an energy policy that has really been working well, as can be seen by what has happened. there remain problems with it, and we will have some debate about where we go in the future. the problem is that the republicans start from a premise that is grievously wrong. they are in denial of climate change, and everything they do relating to energy stems from that. they are out of step with the american people. a recent gallup poll showed this: 64 percent of americans are worried a great deal or a fair amount about global warming. fifty-nine percent of americans say the effects of global warming have already begun. only 10 percent of americans say the effects of global warming will never happen--only 10 percent. sixty-five percent of americans, according to this gallup poll of recent times, say our planet's temperature increases over the last 100 years are primarily caused by human activities rather than natural causes. {time} 1030 but what do we hear from the now-leading republican? well, going back a few years, this is what he had to say: ``the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing noncompetitive.'' that was 4 years ago, more or less. now the same person, who is now leading the republican party, says this: ``i am not a great believer in manmade climate change.'' ``if you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s, and now they have global warming, although now they don't know if they have global warming.'' so we have today, from the republican majority, our two sense of congress resolutions. what is really needed instead is for the republican party to come to their senses on climate change, like the vast majority of the american people. mr. speaker, it is my privilege to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from oregon (mr. blumenauer), one of our many members-- but this person in particular--who has devoted so much of his deep intelligence and his energy to this issue, and i ask unanimous consent that the gentleman be allowed to control the time. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from michigan. there was no objection. mr. boustany. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. kelly), a very important member of the house ways and means committee and someone who has extensive private sector experience. mr. kelly of pennsylvania. i thank my colleague, dr. boustany. mr. speaker, again, before we came on to the floor, we were in the cloakroom talking about what the debate was going to be. and i thought the debate was going to be about what was actually happening today, and not a scientific debate, not a debate about what people believe or what they don't believe, but on the reality that the president proposed a $10 tax on a barrel of oil. that comes out to 25 cents per gallon at the pump. now, what do i mean by that? what i am talking about is, when hardworking american taxpayers go to fill up their car or their truck, it is going to cost them 25 cents more per gallon. it also translates into everything that they put on their backs, that they put in their mouths. every aspect of life is going to be increased. now, keep in mind that, while there may be some kind of science that we want to turn this debate into, here are the facts: middle-income americans and lower-income americans have seen a drop in their wages--a significant drop in their wages. last month, we saw that we have created one job for every 8,000 americans. so we talk about today how we need to talk about climate change. no. here is what we need to talk about: we need to talk about real change in the marketplace. we need to talk about how [[page h3679]] we are hurting the american economy. we need to talk about how we are eliminating the ability of america to compete in a global economy--an economy that i just don't want to participate in but i think america should dominate. america is so blessed with so many assets. and while we worry about all the energy above, let's not forget all the energy below. let's not forget what america's strongest card is to play, and that is energy self-sustainability. we are able to do that. why in the world would anybody think that by adding $10 on a barrel of oil, somehow that is going to help the climate worldwide, when we know that we are the only ones proposing this? other people around the world are looking and saying: i can't agree more with the president's ideas because we compete against the united states, and i would love to be on the shelf with a product that costs more than the one we are putting on the shelf. so america is hurting america. america's policies are hurting everyday americans. and if we truly want to make america great again, let's make america great again for every single american. that is not a political aspiration; that is a responsibility in america's house, and that is the house of representatives. our sense that somehow this would be positive is absolutely wrongheaded and wrong thinking. it just doesn't work that way. why would we sit here and debate this today? because we know it is going to hurt every single hard-working american taxpayer. it is going to add to our cost of living. it is going to increase the cost of everything we consume. we are going to do it with the idea that somehow, the rest of the world will follow suit, and we know that they won't. what they will do is look at us and say: you know what? let's take advantage of america's wrong-headedness. let's make sure that we are able to buy up more of the market, the global market, because america continues to hurt itself and hurt its everyday citizens. my goodness. this is america's house of representatives. we do not come here representing ourselves--we come here representing 705,687 americans who live back in our districts. we do not come here just representing republican policy and republican agenda. we do not just come here representing democrat policy and democrat agenda. we come here representing america. and if we cannot get it through our heads that, at the end of the day, the policy that comes out of this town--a town that is a awash in prosperity, good jobs, great restaurants. i have never seen a town with more cranes in it. i am talking about industrial cranes. i would love some of my colleagues to walk back home with me and go into the cities, the towns, and the little villages that i represent. and you tell those people: things are really getting good; we are on the right stage; we are on the right trajectory; that we are going to become good again. but the question is: when? i would just suggest that--and i said this earlier--you cannot continue to put the burden of these policies--well-intended, though they may be--on the backs of hardworking american taxpayers, men and women who get up every day with one resolve and one resolve only, and that is to take care of their families, to build a better community, and to build a better life. why in the world do we have to waste time debating something today that could be debated elsewhere? but we come here today with a resolution expressing the sense of congress that the president's ideas in his budget are absolutely wrong for every single american. we can debate these things later. but we have to come to agreement at some point here, that we just don't represent our parties--we represent people. that is far more important than any party that we represent. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. boustany. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. mr. kelly of pennsylvania. i thank the gentleman. look, i have only been here 5 years. but i come out of the private sector. i never, ever thought i would be serving in congress because i never, ever thought i would have to. i thought people would come here representing me and my family; my community, my state, and my nation; and that they would do the right thing. and i don't say that they don't think they are doing the right thing. but at the end of the day, the final results don't look very good. in a nation that is quickly approaching $20 trillion in debt and burdening every single american taxpayer with more and more cost of being here while not increasing their opportunity, i think we need to take a hard look, take a look in the mirror and understand that it all changes, it all starts with each of us. we can change this. we can make it better. but we can't make it better by putting a heavy burden on our taxpayers. it just doesn't make sense. as i said earlier, america can dominate a global economy. just participating isn't enough. i would just suggest that that is all possible in a land that has been so graced by gifts from god that make it possible for us to do that. the only thing that can keep it from happening are policies coming out of washington, d.c. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i always enjoy sharing the debate with my good friend from butler, pennsylvania, who cares passionately about this country. he has some, i think, great ideas. we often find areas that we can agree. i think even the issue that we are debating today could be an area where we could find agreement, because what the president is proposing is not to levy a fee and have the money burned up. the president is proposing a fee to fix america's damaged infrastructure. i know my friend from butler cares passionately about the people who he represents. they are paying a tax today for poor infrastructure. the average american pays three times with annual damage to their cars than what this fee would be, if it were translated directly to a gas tax increase. i note that his state of pennsylvania actually has imposed an oil franchise fee which is the equivalent of about another 9.5 cent increase. pennsylvania did that because their infrastructure is damaged. well, that is what we should have as part of this discussion today. again, we have a cartoon proposal that assumes that there is just a barrel fee that is just a burden on the american public and not look at what the fee is for, what benefits would accrue if, again, we had actually had the ways and means committee meet and discuss the legislation that was referred to us. we didn't have a hearing on this. one of the things i have pleaded with ways and means leadership for as long as i have been on the committee: let's sit down and actually have meaningful discussions with the men and women who manage, design, build, and operate america's infrastructure. if we would have had that debate in this congress, we could have had arrayed before us the president of the afl-cio, the president of the u.s. chamber of commerce, the president--actually, we did have the president of the american trucking association, the one witness the democrats were allowed, who said: raise the tax on my people, along with everybody else, to rebuild and renew america. but we never had a robust, broad debate before our committee. if we did, we would have had the broadest coalition of any major issue that we considered: the people who design roads, the people who come forward with the asphalt, and the people who are the delivery services. we are paying a tremendous price today because america is falling apart and falling behind. you don't have to go very far to ask people in louisiana; portland, oregon; or houston, texas, if we have got a problem. this is an investment that more than pays for itself. again, this isn't money down some rat hole. this is money that would be invested to rebuild and renew america. if we would have had a real hearing on this proposal--which we didn't--we could have had the people from standard & poor's research come in and review their report. every $1.2 billion we spend on infrastructure creates $2 billion of economic activity. these are the people who would have family-wage [[page h3680]] jobs from coast to coast who would help revitalize local economies, while we make our infrastructure safer and more effective. and it isn't just economic activity. that standard & poor's report would have revealed that that $1.2 billion in infrastructure would have reduced the deficit by $200 million, but we didn't have that debate. so we have people coming up here on the floor somehow claiming that the president's responsible proposal to fund infrastructure would be an economic disaster, ignoring the fact that we have an infrastructure crisis in this country right now. the american society of civil engineers points out that our failure to deal with this is a tax of over $3,000 per family. if we would be honest, have independent experts, if the committee would do its job, we wouldn't be having bizarre debates like this that suggest that the president's proposal would hurt the economy or would be costly. to the contrary, it would strengthen the economy, put millions of people to work at family-wage jobs, and improve the conditions of families from coast to coast. we are going to have, i hope, more heard about this in the future. but i hope that we don't have proposals that are rushed to the floor without thoughtful committee action and making strange assertions that simply are not supported by facts. {time} 1045 if we impose the fee that the president is talking about to rebuild and renew america, it will create more economic activity, it will put people to work, and it will give americans the infrastructure they deserve and enhance our economic security at home and abroad. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. boustany. mr. speaker, i yield myself 1 minute to respond to something before i yield to my colleague. let me just say that i appreciate the gentleman's passion for transportation infrastructure. i share it. we have had many conversations. but he well knows that the ideal way to solve this is with a specific user fee for that purpose. this particular tax, $10.25 on a barrel of oil, has such a huge detrimental economic impact across all sectors of our economy. that is not the way to go. that is why i don't think this is something we should entertain as the president has proposed. i think we need thoughtful discussion about this, and that will come in due time. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana (mr. graves), a member of the transportation and infrastructure committee and someone i have great respect for. mr. graves of louisiana. mr. speaker, i appreciate the gentleman yielding, and i appreciate him bringing this up. mr. speaker, i really regret the fact that this has devolved into a big partisan debate or a big partisan discussion. everyone in this chamber supports the concept of infrastructure investment. that is not what this is about. that is not what this is about. all of us support infrastructure investment, and all of us agree that we have underfunded infrastructure, that we need more investment in infrastructure. in my home state, in baton rouge, in the capital region, we have the worst traffic in the nation for a midsize city. our people sit in traffic an average of 47 hours above the national average at home. it is ridiculous. here is what is going on right now. here is what is going on. the gas tax was set up to be a user fee. it was set up to be a user fee that the more you drove, the more you used the roads, the more you paid for it. that is the way that this is supposed to work. what has happened is that the president has come out and offered a proposal that disconnects the user fee. we support a user fee model. we support lock-boxing the dollars and making sure that they are dedicated to infrastructure as opposed to what has happened, for example, another issue that the sponsor of this legislation has worked on--the harbor maintenance trust fund--where billions of dollars have been charged on the auspices of one thing and diverted to something else. we support infrastructure investment. now, what is going on right now is we are seeing this continuation of policies out of this administration that is contrary to american interests, and i want to explain that. you see, mr. speaker, the gentleman from oregon state probably--and i haven't verified this--but probably depended upon the state of louisiana, one of the top producers of oil and gas in this country, to power their cars, to power their vehicles, and to power their airplanes that they fly back and forth from washington, d.c., to the west coast. we provide that. but at home, in our state of louisiana, we have lost one-third of our oil and gas jobs. we are killing this industry because of overregulation. something that just shocks me is, last year, we listened to the secretary of state, john kerry, stand up and say: we need to allow iran to export their oil so their economy can recover. our secretary of state said that. yet, at the same time, at home, in louisiana, we were prohibited from exporting our oil. why in the world would we treat iran better than louisiana, better than texas, better than oklahoma, and all of these energy-producing states across the united states? so do you know what we did? after opposition from the white house, we finally lifted the 40-year-old oil export ban. so what happens? within a month and a half, we get a proposal from the president to put a $10.25-a-barrel tax on american oil. what does that do? if we try and take our oil out to global markets, we are immediately met with a premium of 30 to 40 percent over global prices. it further kills our industry. it further kills our domestic production that we have lost one-third of the jobs on. and i know everybody wants to see us fly solar airplanes. it is not happening right now. we need to continue to rely on these fuels moving forward. this should not be a partisan debate. we support infrastructure investment. it needs to continue to be a user fee. we should not divorce it from a user fee, and we should not do it in a way that is going to kill our energy industry in the united states to further increase our reliance upon foreign energy sources. it is a flawed policy. this is consistent with what we saw last year when the president of the united states was standing up and saying, ``give us free trade authority. we need the ability to engage in free trade because we can outcompete other countries,'' and, at the exact same time, standing up and overregulating our economy to where we send american workers out there in the workforce trying to compete with these other countries with our arms tied behind our back. these policies aren't consistent, and they are not in the interest of the united states. i agree with the gentleman from oregon; we need to work together. we need to work together in a bipartisan manner to come up with a new user fee concept to get us additional dollars for infrastructure. this was a unilateral proposal. this was not subject to hearings, and it is not appropriate. it is contrary to our economy; it is contrary to american interests; and it is going to increase our trade deficit. mr. speaker, i strongly urge that we support this legislation and that we move forward in a bipartisan manner to fix the user fee concept to increase the investment in infrastructure to where we can improve our roadways. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i appreciate my friend from louisiana and his assessment. actually, i agree with him. we should have a different mechanism. i have had proposals to have different approaches to funding infrastructure. some of them have been embedded in the more recent transportation reauthorization, but this is something that we never took up in our ways and means committee. i have had legislation there for several congresses. it is time for people to stop saying that they support infrastructure and then not work with us to figure out ways to fund it going forward. mr. speaker, there is nobody in congress in my tenure who has done more to think about what we do for america's infrastructure. he has had many innovative proposals to fund infrastructure. he has been a tireless champion of it. he is the ranking democrat [[page h3681]] on the house transportation and infrastructure committee. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from oregon (mr. defazio). mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i thank my colleague for yielding. those watching or listening might be a little confused what this is about. it is about a meaningless piece of paper. it is called house concurrent resolution 112. it is expressing the sense of congress that something that the president proposed is bad and they don't like it. well, he proposed it and they are not going to take it up. why are we wasting time debating something that they are not going to put on the schedule and isn't a reality? i don't know. because they are trying to fill up time? it is not clear to me. what they are doing is continuing to avoid the discussion of how we are going to pay for america's infrastructure. dwight david eisenhower said, let's have a user fee, a gas tax. the last time we increased the gas tax federally was 1993--18.4 cents a gallon. that figured out to be about 15 percent of every gallon you bought. i paid $2.50 a gallon in oregon last weekend. the federal tax is still 18.4 cents. that is about 7 percent per gallon, and those dollars are worth less. we are talking about what it is going to do to jobs if we have some sort of tax on oil that we use to pay for infrastructure. let's talk about the other side where we can create one heck of a lot of jobs. every penny for a gas tax, every penny, raises about $1.7 billion for the federal trust fund. $1.7 billion, under the most conservative estimates, most conservative, is more than 25,000 jobs. so one penny, 25,000 jobs. but, no, we can't go there. i proposed we index the existing gas tax to inflation. no, we can't do that. all right. didn't want to do that. i proposed that we tax the fraction of a barrel of oil that goes into taxable transportation uses, not manufacturing, not agriculture, not any of this other stuff that they are talking about. i put that proposal forward 7 years ago. i put it forward to my colleagues and to the white house. now, the white house has burped out something different here--this more indiscriminate tax--which would go to other uses. the point is that there are thoughtful ways to approach this and pay for what we need. america is falling apart. 140,000 bridges nationwide--including the highest proportion in the state of pennsylvania, by the way, which we heard from earlier--are in need of replacement or significant repair. trucks are detouring around them. people are being detoured around them. there are potholed roads. forty percent of the national highway system needs not just to be resurfaced, it needs to be dug up it has failed so badly. people are breaking their rims, blowing out tires, and damaging their cars. it is costing americans a lot. people are locked in congestion because we are not dealing with the growth in traffic. and, oh, let's just look out just a little way outside the capital here to the worst example. we are killing people, killing people, on our transit systems unnecessarily because congress has failed to partner with the cities of america and the rural areas who have transit. we have an $84 billion backlog to bring transit up to a state of good repair, not new transit options to get people out of their cars and help them deal with congestion to get around. $84 billion just so we are not killing people. and we are talking about, oh, we can't be competitive. yeah, we are not competitive in the world economy. i go around talking about how we are now degraded. we used to have an infrastructure that was the envy of the world. and i talked about how we are becoming third world. my colleague from oregon (mr. blumenauer) criticized me very, very adamantly about that one day. i said, what do you mean, earl, you know how bad it is? he said, no, no, that is insulting to third world countries. they are investing a larger percentage of their gross domestic product in infrastructure than we are here in the united states of america. and that is true. so now i have taken to calling us fourth world. we used to be the world's leader in infrastructure, and now we are vaulting over everybody, including places like zimbabwe, to the back of the pack. give me a break. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. blumenauer. i yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from oregon. mr. defazio. and where is the discussion? it is no, no, no. no, can't have a barrel tax. no, can't increase the gas tax. no, can't index the gas tax. oh, but we want to talk about a user fee. what user fee? why are we wasting time on this? you are not going to bring it up. you are in charge. you set the agenda. why are we passing a bill to say we are not going to take something up? i would be kind of embarrassed if i was in the majority and that is what i was wasting time on while people are trapped in traffic, while people are dying, because we can't maintain our transit systems. people are blowing out tires because we can't repair the roads. and, oh, we are all for infrastructure until it comes to paying for it. we passed a 5-year bill. we paid for it with phony money. we pretended that when we have private tax collection, that it will make money--private tax collection. republicans have passed that twice before. it kind of pissed off the american people. and guess what, it lost money each time, and then we put it back in the irs. but, no, this time it is going to make money and we are going to use it and pay for infrastructure. give me a break. and the federal reserve makes that money and puts it in a reserve account with a computer. let's take that money and spend it. basically, you are just averting the real problem here, which is we need to have a serious discussion about how we are going to pay to build america's infrastructure and become a world leader again and be the envy of the world again. the speaker pro tempore. the chair will remind members of the house to refrain from vulgarity in debate. mr. boustany. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from virginia (mr. beyer), my friend and colleague from across the potomac river, who cares a great deal about environmental policy and infrastructure. mr. beyer. mr. speaker, i rise in strong opposition to this resolution and add my strong opposition to the resolution before, also. as i read the text of h. con. res. 89, whereas by whereas, i found myself in disagreement with virtually every alleged predictive statement. this resolution is framed as long-term economic wisdom, yet exemplifies short-term thinking and economic folly. a carbon tax should, in fact, increase the cost of fossil fuels, but will also accelerate the rapidly falling cost of all other fuels: solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, and perhaps even nuclear. a carbon tax absolutely must not fall hardest on the poor, the elderly, and those with fixed incomes. the best of the carbon tax plans, representative van hollen's carbon cap and economic dividend, returns every dollar gathered by a carbon cap to every u.s. citizen with a social security number. this carbon cap is actually progressive, with a net increase in the disposable income for most americans, and certainly our neediest citizens. this will be a net job creator. {time} 1100 the resolution suggests that jobs and businesses will move overseas and that a carbon tax will restrain economic growth. british columbia instituted a carbon tax in july 2008, and over the following 5-year period, its gdp growth actually outpaced the rest of non-carbon-priced canada. in one ``whereas,'' it states that u.s. energy policy should encourage private sector innovation and development, but nothing would stimulate and sustain such innovation as powerfully as would appropriate carbon pricing. every manufacturer, perhaps every family, would continue to search out the best ways to minimize the costs of production and to maximize family welfare. we are resilient, creative, and adaptive. for a long time, conservative and liberal economists have agreed that a carbon tax is the most efficient and effective way to deal with climate change. [[page h3682]] let me quote from a recent letter from four conservative and libertarian leaders to members of congress: the least burdensome, most straightforward, and most market friendly means of addressing climate change is to price the risks imposed by greenhouse gas emissions via a tax. this would harness price signals, rather than regulations, to guide a market response. that is why carbon pricing has the support of free market economists, a majority of the global business community, and a large number of the largest multinational private oil and gas companies in the world. one of the policy issues that most divides our congress is the debate on the appropriate level of governmental regulation. but to quote again from the same letter: an economy-wide carbon tax that replaces existing regulatory interventions could reduce the cost of climate policy and deregulate the economy. jerry taylor of the niskanen center wrote a paper called ``the conservative case for a carbon tax.'' he argues that, if conservative denial of climate science is grounded in ideological aversion to command-and-control regulation, as proposed in the epa's proposed clean power plan, conservatives should embrace and promote a revenue-neutral carbon tax as a more efficient, less burdensome, free market alternative. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to oppose both resolutions as they are unwise, unnecessary, and of backward thinking. mr. boustany. mr. speaker, as i have no further requests for time, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. in closing, i appreciate the opportunity for us to visit on this proposal today. i don't agree with the resolution by any stretch of the imagination, but at least it is an opportunity for us to have a little bit of the conversation that we should have been having all along. i enjoy debating with my good friend from louisiana. i respect his intellect and his humor, and it is fun to do a little bit of this today. it would have been far better if we would have been able to do so in the context of a full committee hearing where we would have been able to dig deeply into these issues. for example, we could have had the transportation construction coalition. i include in the record a letter on this resolution, a letter which is dated june 9 of this year. june 9, 2016. dear representative: the house is scheduled to consider later this week a resolution opposing president obama's proposal for a $10.25 per barrel of oil tax. while h. con. res. 112 makes many statements regarding an oil barrel tax, the resolution fails to mention the intent of the president's proposal is to generate resources to stabilize and grow federal surface transportation investment. the resolution also does not remind members that recurring highway trust fund revenue shortfalls caused repeated disruptions to their state's transportation program over the past eight years. since 2008, congress has approved seven pieces of legislation transferring a total $143 billion in borrowed or general fund revenue into the highway trust fund to prevent cuts in federal highway and transit investment. over that same period, the trust fund's permanent revenue deficit has led to 14 temporary extensions of the surface transportation programs and one short-term reauthorization bill. furthermore, upon the expiration of the fixing america's surface transportation (fast) act at the end of fy 2020, the congressional budget office projects the trust fund's average annual shortfall will grow to $18 billion. while the sincerity of the obama administration's proposal for a highway trust fund solution is dubious given its release three months after the president signed the fast act into law, a per barrel oil tax of that magnitude would be a real and permanent solution. and its nexus to highway users as a revenue mechanism is far more honest than the budget gimmicks, deficit spending and burdens placed on non- transportation sectors of the economy that the congress has deployed since 2008 to keep investment in the surface transportation programs essentially static. we certainly respect the right of members of congress to disagree with the president's proposal, but it is incumbent upon anyone who does so to bring forward an alternative way to achieve the same objective. we strongly believe all potential revenue options should be on the table. preliminarily disparaging one significant solution just makes it more difficult to resolve a problem that has plagued congress for nearly a decade. rather than making rhetorical statements about taxes five months before an election, congress should be working in a bipartisan manner to ensure that a permanent mechanism to preserve and grow federal highway and public transportation investment is in place well before the u.s. department of transportation starts warning states of the next highway program shutdown. sincerely, the transportation construction coalition. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, they point out that the resolution fails to mention that the intent of the president's proposal is to generate resources to stabilize and grow federal surface transportation investment. the resolution does not remind members that the recurring highway trust fund revenue shortfalls caused repeated disruptions to their states' transportation programs over the past eight years. we have had to have 14 temporary extensions of the surface transportation act, and the only way we got the fast act passed, as my friend congressman defazio pointed out, was with a series of budget gimmicks, not real solutions. at the end of 2020, when that legislation expires, we are going to face a $20 billion annual deficit. the per barrel oil tax of this magnitude, according to the transportation construction coalition, would be a real and a permanent solution. we wouldn't be chasing our tails all the time. and its nexus to highway users as a revenue mechanism is far more honest than the budget gimmicks, deficit spending, and burdens placed on non- transportation sectors of the economy that congress has deployed since 2008 to keep investment, essentially, static. they state that they believe all potential revenue options should be on the table, that it is incumbent upon anybody who wants to disagree with the president to bring forward an alternative way to meet the same objective, which, sadly, has not happened. we haven't even been able to discuss it in the ways and means committee. they write: preliminarily disparaging one significant solution just makes it more difficult to resolve a problem that has plagued congress for more than a decade. rather than making rhetorical statements about taxes 5 months before an election, congress should be working in a bipartisan manner to ensure that a permanent mechanism to preserve and grow federal highway and public transportation investment is in place well before the department of transportation starts warning states about the next program shutdown. i seldom read statements from other groups on the floor, but i couldn't have said it better myself. that is what we should be doing rather than this exercise today, which completely misses the point. this oil barrel fee may not be perfect, but it would go a long way toward solving the problem. it will put millions of americans to work at family-wage jobs. it will create more economic activity than the cost of the program. for every $1.2 billion that it generates, it will generate $2 billion of economic activity, and it will reduce the deficit $200 million. if we had actually had the committee do a deep dive and spend a week in working on it, this would have been on the table, and i think we would have found wide areas of agreement. rather than engaging in this exercise regarding h. con. res. 112, i would like to think of what ronald reagan did in 1982. the economy was pretty rocky in 1982. there were some contentious politics in congress. ronald reagan, in his thanksgiving day speech on november 29, 1982, called on congress to come back from their thanksgiving recess and work together to more than double the federal gas tax, because in one of the best speeches, frankly, i have ever heard anybody give, he pointed out the little cost to the american consumer would be more than offset by damage, for example, for a couple pair of shock absorbers. congress reacted to president reagan's call for a gas tax increase on a bipartisan basis. it more than doubled it. it added hundreds of thousands of jobs, and it improved the quality of life for americans. it did so in keeping the bipartisan tradition surrounding infrastructure. rather than this partisan partial debate, we ought to go back to the basics, follow ronald reagan's example, and have a spirited, comprehensive approach to solving the problem rather than tilting at straw men. i strongly urge the rejection of the resolution, but, more important, the rejection of this approach to continue to stick our heads in the sand and [[page h3683]] avoid our responsibility to fund american infrastructure and to rebuild and renew this great country. madam speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. boustany. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. i appreciate the gentleman's passion and intellect, and we have had many conversations. we do agree that we have to fix our deplorable infrastructure, and he and i have worked on some of these things together; but i have to say this: when i was in medical school--and i am a heart surgeon and i have had years of medical training--one of the things we learned a long time ago in medicine was to avoid iatrogenic treatment, which is a fancy, greek-derived word which means to avoid a treatment that makes the problem worse. that is what this $10.25 tax would do on a barrel of oil. i have often referred to that plaque above the speaker's desk. it is a quote from daniel webster. the very first line of that reads: ``let us develop the resources of our land.'' i think it goes beyond simple concepts of highway transportation. it is all the resources of our land. we should be embracing the energy revolution that has been unleashed by american innovation, not taxing it into oblivion, not overregulating it into oblivion. this has offered tremendous hope not only for americans, but for the world over, to offer a new view of energy security, taking us away from the iranian approach or the opec approach or a russian view by which they hoard resources and use this for their own political purposes. america can reshape it by embracing this energy revolution, and we can grow the economy, create jobs, improve wages, and have the revenues to take care of our infrastructure. as the gentleman well knows, ronald reagan believed that a user fee was important, a specific user fee. i think he and i would both agree that a specific user fee is important for infrastructure. this is not a user fee. this is a detrimental tax on american competitiveness, on american jobs, on american wages, on american energy security, and it hits at the very foundation of our national security. it is the wrong way to go. it is an iatrogenic solution, a harmful solution. it is not pro-growth. we are not proud of the economic performance we have seen in recent months: 0.8 percent economic growth in the first quarter, only 38,000 non-farm jobs created last month, according to the u.s. bureau of labor. that is deplorable. america must lead, and america can lead by embracing the energy revolution. let's look at all of the impacts it will have across our entire economy, and then we can fashion specific solutions for transportation and infrastructure and for the other things we need to do. this is why i stand here. that is why i oppose this tax. that is why i think this debate was important, and that is why i think it is very important to go on record as opposing this very detrimental tax. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. gene green of texas. mr. speaker, i rise this morning in opposition to h. con. res. 112, expressing the sense of congress opposing the president's proposed $10 tax on every barrel of oil. during my time in congress, i have represented all five major refineries and countless energy production firms in east harris county. i know the importance of the domestically produced and refined oil to the u.s. economy. i also know the importance of a well-funded transportation system. houston is growing rapidly and our transportation system needs to expand with our population. i stand in opposition to today's sense of congress because of this knowledge and experience. but to clarify, we shouldn't make things tougher on american companies and domestically-produced crude. i do not support a $10 dollar tax on our natural resources. i do not support a $10 dollar tax on wildcatters in west texas, north dakota or any other areas in the u.s. that supply crude to the texas gulf coast. it is these companies that are responsible for the energy renaissance in the u.s. these entrepreneurs lowered our gas prices, reduced our foreign dependence and made the u.s. the largest producer of oil in the world. i do support a $10 dollar tax on imported oil from foreign sources. imported oil from countries that may or may not be our friends does not benefit our national security or domestic economy. we should sharpen our competitive edge and expand our 21st century transportation system by taxing imported oil. i stand with our domestic companies, we should continue to produce and refine u.s. crude for the benefit of u.s. consumers and workers. but i stand in opposition of this overly expansive sense of congress and i ask my colleagues to do the same. mr. marchant. mr. speaker, putting a regressive tax on hardworking americans is not the way to strengthen the economy, balance the budget, or create jobs. the president's proposed $10.25 per barrel tax on crude oil is an administrative grab to increase spending and tax a targeted industry. thousands of jobs have been lost in these uncertain times for the oil and gas industry and impacted communities. now is not the time to make matters worse for an important economic engine and slow an already weak economic recovery. the obama administration knows this tax would be passed down to american families. the non-partisan congressional research service reported that this tax could increase the price of a gallon of gasoline by 25 cents--which is a 10 percent hike on today's prices. that would increase the cost of a wide range of goods for all consumers. the resolution before us takes a strong stand and makes perfectly clear that congress will not allow the president's harmful tax to go forward. it also pushes for a tough review of the effects of ill-conceived tax proposals that target specific industries, as the president's tax does. we must ensure that tax policy decisions are made in a reasoned way that protects working families--rather than harms them in a single- minded hunt for revenue. mr. speaker, i encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting house concurrent resolution 112 and voting for its passage. mr. castro of texas. mr. speaker, today, the house of representatives will consider h. con. res. 112--expressing the sense of congress opposing the president's proposed $10 tax on every barrel of oil. this unserious, nonbinding resolution is simply nothing more than a cynical republican political messaging bill. indeed, the resolution purposely fails to include that the proposal was a serious attempt by the president to finance the critical infrastructure needs our country most certainly requires. the energy industry is critical to the global economy. unfortunately, the manner in which the majority has decided to have this discussion leaves little room for thought or earnest debate. for these reasons, i will vote present, and will encourage my colleagues to continue to work in earnest to find a long-term, sustainable solution to move forward with putting americans to work in building out our transportation needs. the speaker pro tempore (mr. woodall). all time for debate has expired. pursuant to house resolution 767, the previous question is ordered. the question is on the concurrent resolution. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. boustany. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.

CREC-2016-06-10-pt1-PgH3669-2,CREC-2016-06-10,114,EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT A CARBON TAX WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3669-H3677] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT A CARBON TAX WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 767, I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 89) expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the concurrent resolution is considered read. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: H. Con. Res. 89 Whereas a carbon tax is a Federal tax on carbon released from fossil fuels; Whereas a carbon tax will increase energy prices, including the price of gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and home heating oil; Whereas a carbon tax will mean that families and consumers will pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and electricity; Whereas a carbon tax will fall hardest on the poor, the elderly, and those on fixed incomes; Whereas a carbon tax will lead to more jobs and businesses moving overseas; Whereas a carbon tax will lead to less economic growth; Whereas American families will be harmed the most from a carbon tax; Whereas, according to the Energy Information Administration, in 2011, fossil fuels share of energy consumption was 82 percent; Whereas a carbon tax will increase the cost of every good manufactured in the United States; Whereas a carbon tax will impose disproportionate burdens on certain industries, jobs, States, and geographic regions and would further restrict the global competitiveness of the United States; Whereas American ingenuity has led to innovations in energy exploration and development and has increased production of domestic energy resources on private and State-owned land which has created significant job growth and private capital investment; Whereas United States energy policy should encourage continued private sector innovation and development and not increase the existing tax burden on manufacturers; Whereas the production of American energy resources increases the United States ability to maintain a competitive advantage in today's global economy; Whereas a carbon tax would reduce America's global competitiveness and would encourage development abroad in countries that do not impose this exorbitant tax burden; and Whereas the Congress and the President should focus on pro- growth solutions that encourage increased development of domestic resources: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The concurrent resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee. General Leave Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on H. Con. Res. 89, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 89, which takes a strong stand against the carbon tax that would hurt American families, workers, and job creators. As the President closes out his time in office, he would like nothing more than to ram through more of his harmful energy agenda. Just look at the President's budget this year. Among the $3.4 trillion in tax hikes he proposed, the President included a $10 per barrel tax on oil. This tax alone would cause gas prices to increase by an estimated 25 cents per gallon. With a carbon tax, there would be a tax hike on production, distribution, and the use of not only oil but also of natural gas and any other form of energy that emits carbon. Such a tax would have many serious impacts on our economy by making day-to-day life more expensive for families throughout this country. First, a carbon tax could drive up the cost of energy for both the producers and the consumers. This translates to larger energy bills that eat up even more of Americans' take-home pay, especially during the hottest and coldest months of the year. Second, a carbon tax would destroy well-paying jobs throughout the American energy sector--a sector that has fueled significant job growth throughout the country. Third, a carbon tax would deliver a direct hit to working families and have compound effects that would reach all corners of the economy. In fact, a carbon tax would increase the cost of, virtually, every good manufactured or service performed in the United States, including everyday necessities. If a good requires energy to make or transport, which most do, taxes on that energy are, essentially, a tax on that good. As a result, Americans would have to pay more for everything-- from milk to clothing to school supplies. Finally, to make this bad idea even worse, we know that a carbon tax would hurt those who are living in poverty and those who are on fixed incomes more than anyone else. Put simply, a carbon tax would make it harder for us to grow our economy and help working families and small businesses succeed. [[Page H3670]] We all want an all-of-the-above energy approach that supports new innovations, not a targeted tax hike on specific industries. Thanks to the leadership of Whip Scalise, Congress will pass this bill today and send it to the Senate, and we will send a clear message to the people in our districts, as well as to the Obama White House, that we do not support this extreme tax. Instead, we will continue to pass legislation that grows our economy and that helps more Americans get back to work. After all, last week, we received the worst jobs report in almost 6 years. It is more important than ever that we move forward with a bold, pro-growth agenda, not another expensive Washington tax. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. What is happening today is further evidence that the Republicans are simply not doing their job. There is real work to be done. It is simply inexcusable that action has not yet happened to prepare for the Zika virus. That would be real action. Helping the people of Flint get clean drinking water, in my home State, would be something real. There is no budget resolution that has been considered here on the House floor. Raising the minimum wage would also be real, and it would help lift many families out of poverty. Closing tax loopholes and making the Tax Code fairer would be real. Instead, today, we are voting on two senses of Congress resolutions. Doing so provides further evidence that the Republicans not only are not acting on those real problems mentioned earlier but are in denial on another real issue that needs action--climate change. The scientific evidence of climate change is overwhelming, and the consensus is clear, and we have seen the impacts of climate change, virtually, every day in our country and around the world. This week, the CBO, led by a Director appointed by the majority here, released a report that identified the effects of climate change as a potential risk to the Federal budget. According to that report, the cost of hurricane damage is projected to be $35 billion more than it is today because of climate change. The report stated: ``Human activities around the world, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and widespread changes in land use, are producing growing emissions of greenhouse gases.'' Climate change requires all of us, including the Republicans here who are in total denial, to come to our senses and to act on the challenge of climate change. This sense of Congress resolution, like the second one, completely fails to meet that challenge. I urge its rejection. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) control the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), a member of the Ways and Means Committee and the chairman of the Tax Policy Subcommittee. Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my colleague and friend on the Ways and Means Committee, Mrs. Black, for yielding time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 89, a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy. At a time when 80 percent of domestic energy consumption comes from natural gas, from oil, from coal, it is, clearly, counterproductive to make these necessary resources more expensive by imposing an indirect tax on these fuels. A carbon tax means higher utility bills for families, more expensive goods and services for consumers, decreased economic activity, and it would really hurt job creation. We already heard about the dismal numbers last week that were released--38,000 non-farm-related jobs. Let me just be clear. When we were in the recession, one of the prime drivers economically that took us out of the recession was the shale revolution--a real energy renaissance in this country. Mr. Speaker, this type of tax is not just a tax on carbon--it is a tax on working families; it is a tax on the American economy; it is a tax on American competitiveness; it is a tax on our energy security. It strikes right at the foundation of our national security. It is the wrong thing to do. It is a regressive tax. It hurts the people who are most dependent on fixed incomes--seniors. It hurts them most. Why would we even consider doing this? There are better ways to set up taxation for this country that meet our needs. I just don't understand why one would propose this type of tax, other than the fact that there is a radical environmental agenda, which would hurt manufacturing and American competitiveness. We can't do this. We need to grow this economy. We need growth around 3 to 4 percent minimum to create jobs, to let American business create value, to assert American leadership globally. We are not going to do this with a carbon tax. We won't do it. We need pro-growth policies. Mr. Speaker, the American people understand this. A recent study by the Institute for Energy Policy found that over 60 percent of Americans oppose this type of idea. I applaud Whip Scalise for offering this sensible resolution because it then puts forth a very strong, affirmative statement that we are not going to disarm the American economy, that we are not going to strike a blow at American competitiveness when we are struggling already as it is. I am sick and tired of the fact that American leadership is eroding around the world. I am sick and tired of the fact that we are walking around with timidity. We ought to be embracing the concept of American leadership. This gives us an opportunity, based on American innovation and energy--the clearest example of which I know of American exceptionalism--to rewrite the rules of energy security based on open markets, transparent pricing, and diversity of supply source. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to hear my friend from Louisiana with his impassioned presentation today; but his presentation, coming on the heels of what we all heard from the Prime Minister of India--calling for a low carbon, sustainable, innovative future--makes me sad. If we would have had our economy take these issues seriously--maybe have a week of hearings--we would have been able to demonstrate to the gentleman with an impartial panel of independent experts all across the political spectrum--Conservative, Liberal, Republican, and Democrat-- that a carbon tax, revenue neutral, is, actually, the key to the innovative future they want. There are all sorts of ways to design a carbon tax, to, actually, enhance the role--the economic status--of low- and moderate-income people, but we never had a hearing on that. It is just simply dismissed as something that we can't do, but they have done it elsewhere in the world. If the committee had done its job, we would be dealing with facts, not hyperbole. {time} 0930 If the committee had done its job, we would have heard that we have very real challenges today to American security, which our Department of Defense has pointed out. Climate change, despite denial from some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, is a threat today to the American military posture. Climate change is disrupting industries like fishing. It is producing unprecedented flooding, forest fires, and a wildly unpredictable weather future. The reduction of arctic ice at unprecedented levels ought to be of concern to my friends on the other side of the aisle. Maybe if we had some open, honest hearings that were balanced and independent, that case would have been made and they may support it. But whether or not they care about climate change and global warming, a carbon tax makes sense for American innovation, the economy, and our competitiveness. It is the areas of low-carbon energy that have seen the job growth. There are now more people [[Page H3671]] working in wind and solar than the coal industry by far. That is where the job growth has been undertaken. A carbon tax would enhance America's global competitiveness. And if we had hearings, listening to independent experts across the board, that case would be made, and I don't think we would have this foolish resolution on the floor. These are elements that would inject into our energy policy an even, balanced approach using market forces, which are much easier than some of the incentives that we have, which are important, which people on both sides of the aisle have supported in the past. But a carbon tax is a more effective way of achieving those objectives. Now, Mr. Speaker, I am sad that we didn't have that debate in committee. I am sad that we didn't hear from independent experts. I think of our friend Bob Inglis, former Congressperson, who is on a personal crusade working with the evangelical community about the merits of a carbon tax. It would have been great to have heard from Bob and others like him to be able to present a balanced picture and be able to deal with meaningful policy. I still hope that someday, that time will come that our Ways and Means Committee actually takes the time to dive into one of the most important issues of the day and to examine one of the tools that independent experts all across the spectrum agree would be a solid addition and actually simplify the Tax Code while we can help people in low income and small business and provide incentives for America's global competitiveness, like we heard from the Prime Minister of India from that very rostrum just 2 days ago. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a colleague of mine and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black). We see eye to eye on almost everything in our lives, and it is really good to be able to stand here today and speak so strongly in favor of H. Con. Res. 89. I really do appreciate the passion and sincerity of my colleagues across the aisle. What we are talking today is about policy. What we are talking about today is the all-important, unintended consequences that so often are put to blame for bad things that happen to American people. They are well intended, yes, at their conception, but very harmful. We are talking about a carbon tax, $10 a barrel on oil. And we are saying: Well, don't worry about that because that is going to be charged upstream. That is going to be charged when it is taken out of the ground. But we all know that every single tax, every single cost is paid downstream. What do I mean by that? Every day hardworking Americans get up in the morning and want to put a roof over the heads of their families, food on the table, clothes on their back, and a little bit of money put away for their future. But every day we continue to come up with policies that somehow, although well intended, make it harder for them to make a living, make it harder for them to live the American Dream, make it harder for them to get ready for the future. Now, I know there are always going to be existential threats. I get that. My grandson is afraid to get out of bed at night because he thinks there is a monster under it. He thinks that if you get up in the middle of the night, maybe there is somebody in the closet or maybe there is something else. Now, I am not a climate change denier. Of course, the climate changes. I have seen it happen in my life. I have seen it where people say it is getting too cold and now it is getting too warm. Well, you know what? It just changes. I get that. What doesn't change is the assault on the American people to pick up the tab on all of these costs. There is nothing that makes less sense to me than what we are doing. And back home where I come from, there is an old saying that goes something like this: Measure twice and cut once. Why? Because once you do that cut, it is permanent. That is why you want to measure twice to make sure that the cut you make is the right cut. That is why you need to take the policies that affect everyday American people and make sure that you are not hurting them. Well intended, I get it. I know it is well intended. I just don't think the American people have to pay the brunt of this. I am very aware of the Prime Minister of India being here Wednesday. And I also know that between India and China, that is where the greatest pollution comes from. I get it. I get it. Putting $10 a barrel on oil coming out of the ground just doesn't make sense. I would just like my friends on both sides of the aisle to think about somebody named Steven Jobs. Steven Jobs did not invent the PC because we taxed typewriters too high and caused the cost of that. Innovation, of course, is the answer. And we have seen great innovation. I know where I am from in western Pennsylvania, that clean coal is real. But the President promised, when he was running as a candidate, that he would put those who chose to make electricity by burning coal out of business. So we regulate them to the point where it is no longer cost efficient to do that, but we keep moving that way. The fact that 40,000 Pennsylvanians make a living that way, well, don't worry about that, they will have to find something else to do. You can go down to West Virginia and you can hear where candidates told them: Listen, you are going to be out of business, but we will find something else for you to do and we will just get to that later. Look, we have an opportunity today. This is a sense of Congress to tell the American people what it is that we think goes on with this policy. For far too long we have turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to the people who sent us here to represent them. We talk very loftily about what it is that we would like to see, how it is that we would like it to go, our dream for the future. But we forget that every day, hardworking American taxpayers get up, throw their feet out over the side of the bed, and go to work for a very particular reason: their families, their churches, their schools, their communities and, more importantly, all of America. Well intended, yes. But the results would be devastating. And who would pay this carbon tax? Who would pay this $10 a barrel? It would be any man or woman who has to go out and buy anything for his or her family. It would be reflected in the cost of everything we put on our backs and everything we put in our mouths. It would affect everything we do when we travel from one point to another, but we say it is necessary. It is necessary because we have to tax this so high that we drive people away from it. I would hope that we could come together in America's House and do what is right for America's people, to do what is right for the people who sent us here to represent them because they are working so hard to make sure that there is a future for their children. In the last month when we created one job for every 8,000 Americans-- one job for every 8,000 Americans, are you kidding me?--in the greatest country the world has ever known, in a Nation that leads the world in defending freedom and liberty, in a Nation that knows that the best way to help others is through American participation---- The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I do want to make sure that this final point comes across: We can work together for solutions. We can work together to do the same things for the same people that we all came here to represent. I do not think that there are ill-intended ideas on the other side. I think they are well-intended. I just think they are wrong. I think they are wrong for the times, and I think they are wrong for the American people. As I said earlier, where I am from, there are a lot of old adages. And one of them is: don't worry about the mule, just load the wagon. I will tell you right now that the mule is trying to find a way to unhook [[Page H3672]] itself from the wagon because that load has gotten too heavy to pay. I know that the people who are loading the wagon think it is okay because at some point, that is going to have to be delivered somewhere. The truth of the matter is it is not. We have put too heavy a burden on American taxpayers, hardworking American taxpayers, hardworking Americans. 1.4 million American lives have been sacrificed for the freedom and liberty not just of this country--our country and our Nation--but for the whole world. So I say let's be careful before we do these well-intended but careless things. Let's be careful before we turn our backs on the people who we actually represent here, and that is hardworking American people. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I couldn't agree more with my good friend from Butler, Pennsylvania, that we can actually come together and fashion solutions. That is why it is such a tragedy that this resolution comes to the floor without ever having our committee work on it, because we could have had hearings that could have narrowed those gaps. I include in the Record a letter from six conservative advocates for climate change action. June 7, 2016. Dear Representative: Later this week Congress will take up a resolution sponsored by Congressman Scalise (R-LA1) that expresses the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the economy of the United States. We are concerned that this resolution offers a limited perspective on carbon taxes and is blind to the potential benefits of market-based climate policy. Legislation that incorporates a carbon tax could include regulatory and tax reforms to make the United States economy more competitive, innovative, and robust, benefiting both present and future generations. We recognize that a carbon tax, like any tax, will impose economic costs. But climate change is also imposing economic costs. This resolution falls short by recognizing the cost of action without considering the cost of staying on our present policy course. There are, of course, uncertainties about the future cost of climate change and, likewise, the cost associated with a carbon tax (much would depend on program design and the pace and nature of technological progress). The need for action, however, is clear. A recent survey of economists who publish in leading peer-reviewed journals on these matters found that 93% believe that a meaningful policy response to climate change is warranted. The least burdensome, most straightforward, and most market-friendly means of addressing climate change is to price the risks imposed by greenhouse gas emissions via a tax. This would harness price signals, rather than regulations, to guide market response. That is why carbon pricing has the support of free market economists, a majority of the global business community, and a large number of the largest multinational private oil and gas companies in the world (the corporate entities among the most directly affected by climate policy). In reaching a conclusion, this resolution neglects the fact that the United States already has a multiplicity of carbon taxes. They are imposed, however, via dozens of federal and state regulations, are invisible to consumers, unevenly imposed across industrial sectors, unnecessarily costly, and growing in size and scope. The policy choice is not if we should price carbon emissions, but how. Unfortunately, this resolution also fails to differentiate between proposals that would impose carbon taxes on top of existing regulations (chiefly the Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan), and proposals that would impose carbon taxes in place of those existing regulations. Conservatives and free market advocates should embrace the latter, regardless of how they view climate risks. An economy-wide carbon tax that replaces existing regulatory interventions could reduce the cost of climate policy and deregulate the economy. It could also provide revenue to support pro-growth tax reform, including corporate income or payroll tax cuts, which could dramatically reduce overall costs on the economy. Revenues could be applied to compensate those who suffer the most from higher energy costs; the poor, the elderly, and individuals and families living on fixed incomes. Unfortunately, none of those options are presently available because Members of Congress have neglected opportunities to design and debate market-friendly climate policies in legislation. Instead, they have yielded authority in climate policy design to the Executive Branch. By discouraging a long-overdue discussion about sensible carbon pricing, this resolution frustrates the development of better policy. Sincerely, Jerry Taylor, President, Niskanen Center. Bob Inglis, Executive Director, RepublicEn. Aparna Mathur, Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute. Eli Lehrer, President, R Street Institute. The Rev. Mitchell C. Hescox, President, Evangelical Environmental Network. Alan Viard, Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Pennsylvania could have heard them talk about the need for action and how you can design a carbon tax that meets the objectives he is talking about, but we never did that. We didn't listen to experts across the spectrum--Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, economists, and scientists--to be able to examine the facts. Instead, we have a cartoon proposal that they are arguing against as opposed to something that we could have worked on together that is promoted by most of the independent experts in the field. And someday within our lifetime this Congress will consider and, I think, probably approve. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Seattle, Washington (Mr. McDermott), who has looked at some of these challenges around the globe. Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, as I come to speak on the floor, I think I am in the House of the deniers. Now, in 2007, that liberal journal, National Geographic, had an article called ``The Big Thaw.'' And it says: ``It's no surprise that a warming climate is melting the world's glaciers and polar ice. But no one expected it to happen this fast.'' That was in 2007. That was 9 years ago. I was taken, along with Gerry Connolly, up to the Arctic with the Norweigian Government. They are worried about what is happening. This resolution is just burying your head in the sand. I think you are thinking that if you put your head in the sand long enough, it will go away and, when you pull your head out, it won't be there. The CBO just put a report out: Texas, Louisiana, and Florida are going to have hurricane damage that is unbelievable. FEMA already accounts for 45 percent of money spent on hurricane damage, $95 billion since 2000. Now, if you think the insurance companies are going to keep insuring against hurricanes, you have another thing coming. At some point, they are going to say: We are not doing hurricane insurance in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and a whole bunch of other places. That is the economics. You say: Let's not pay anything right now, let's not change anything, let's not work on it. But if we don't work on it, we are going to pay later. I am old enough to remember a FRAM commercial on the television. It was an air cleaner on your car, and it said: Pay me now or pay me later. And this is what this is about today. Now, there are things going on in this country which just absolutely boggle my mind. In North Carolina, the assembly got together and they said: You know what? We are not going to spend any money to measure the sea levels. Now, you have hundreds of miles of coastline in North Carolina where the sea is rising and property values are going to be lost. We are talking money here. We are not talking soft, liberal stuff. This is real, and people don't want to even look at it. In Florida and Wisconsin, they took a novel approach and they said: We are not even going to use the words ``climate change'' in anything. Now, here in Congress, the climate deniers take many forms, from blocking the words ``social cost of carbon'' to directing the Department of Defense to ignore climate change. All the while, the DOD itself highlights the threat of climate change to national security. Republicans like to talk about national security. {time} 0945 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. McDERMOTT. If you are serious about talking about national security, [[Page H3673]] you better start talking about the climate change that is going on in the world. Sea lanes across the North Pole are coming, boats are already coming, we are building the Panama Canal wider, and it is opening up on the north end of the globe. Now, this absurdity cannot last, and we have got to begin to do what Mr. Blumenauer suggested. There have to be hearings. Bob Inglis, I knew him when he was here. God, he was a wild-eyed liberal. I couldn't believe what a wild-eyed liberal he was. He came down here talking about a carbon tax. I had a carbon tax. Mr. Larson had a carbon tax. This is not a partisan issue, Democrat versus Republican; it is whether or not you are going to look at the science of what is happening on the globe. I urge people to vote ``no'' on this. You will come back and do it in a couple of years. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our majority whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for yielding. I am proud to bring forward this legislation, Mr. Speaker, that expresses the strong sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy. If you look at what this administration has done through radical rules and regulations, through all of its agencies, starting with the EPA, with the IRS, with the NLRB, the whole alphabet soup of Federal agencies that every morning wake up trying to figure out how to make it harder for our economy to get moving again, how to make it harder for people to create jobs in America, frankly, the results of these radical regulations are shifting and running jobs away, out of our country to foreign countries like China, like India, and they want to keep it going. This is not a new concept, Mr. Speaker. They tried this years ago when they brought through the cap-and-trade bill. Passed out of the House, it couldn't even pass in the Senate when they had a supermajority in the Senate with 60 votes because it was such a detrimental idea that would devastate our economy. Yet even with that defeat, President Obama still tries to come back with a carbon tax through other means, whether it is regulations or whether it is superimposed carbon taxes through the EPA and some of the other things they are doing. We have had hearings on this, Mr. Speaker. There is data all around that confirms how devastating a carbon tax would be to the United States economy. You can just look at what some of the outside groups that look at this said. The National Association of Manufacturers, the people that make things in America, have confirmed we would lose more than a million jobs in America if a carbon tax was imposed. Where would those jobs go? They would go to countries, ironically, that don't have the good environmental standards we already have. So they would go to countries like China and India where, if you are concerned about carbon going into the atmosphere, the things that they do to produce the same things we produce here in America, it creates more than five times the amount of carbon in those countries. So you are shifting jobs out of America to send it to countries where you would actually create more carbon. They talk about somehow being able to create policy that will stop hurricanes and change the sea level rising, for goodness sake, as if some policy is going to do that. By the way, the result of their policies will increase carbon in the Earth's atmosphere. But let's not even talk about that. Let's actually talk about the track record of this administration that now wants to control the Earth's temperature. They spent over $500 million and couldn't even create a Web site to take your health insurance requests, healthcare.gov. Remember that? Well, this same group now thinks they can control the Earth's temperature through radical policies. Again, let's look at the devastating impact these policies would have. They wouldn't work, first of all, but they would have a devastating impact on the middle class of this country. The Congressional Budget Office, our own Congressional Budget Office that looked at this, said a carbon tax would actually hit low-income people the hardest, even harder than high-income people. It would have a devastating impact on those people who are least able to afford it because it would increase the cost of everything they do. It would increase your food costs at the grocery store. It would increase, of course, what you pay at the pump. It would increase your electricity prices. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman. Mr. SCALISE. The Heritage Foundation looked at this and said that this kind of carbon tax would actually increase the cost of everything that families buy by over $1,400 per family. Families are going to pay $1,400 more every year for the cost of a carbon tax that the other side wants to defend. And to yield what? To just yield an opportunity for countries like China and India to grow their economies at the expense of ours. So, Mr. Speaker, if you look at what they are trying to do--and, again, if you want to do this, bring it forward as an idea in legislation. They tried it with cap-and-trade, and it got defeated when Democrats controlled everything. There is bipartisanship on this issue, and the bipartisanship is in opposition to a carbon tax. So why don't we go on record and be very clear about it, not just that it is bad policy, but also to reaffirm how devastating it would be for the United States economy. It shouldn't move forward. The President needs to stop this radical agenda and instead focus on reversing the depressing economic activity that we have seen in this country since he has been President because of these kinds of policies. Let's get real economic growth. Let's bring those jobs back to the United States. Let's reject a carbon tax. I urge adoption of this resolution. Mr. BLUMENAUER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed my friend from Louisiana's impassioned presentation. It is too bad that the Committee on Ways and Means didn't actually sit down and go through the elements that would be in a balanced carbon tax. He is debating a cartoon version, not one that we worked on. I am going to yield, in a moment, to one of the gentlemen who, earlier in this carbon debate several Congresses ago, has been involved with crafting a realistic carbon tax. We had the reference to the inability to move the cap-and-trade, which I don't think is as good as a carbon tax. It failed because there were a minority of the Senate who were opposed to allowing it to go forward. It wasn't that we didn't have a majority that were interested. In the Senate, you can have a veto with 41 people who are decided that they are not going to allow things to move forward. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson). He has been a student of a carbon tax, who has listened to those people across the political spectrum and has been a champion of a reasonable, thoughtful approach to promote American innovation. I would just point out the areas where we have had the greatest job growth in the energy sector have not been petroleum or coal. It has been solar and wind. A carbon tax would help accelerate that by leveling the playing field and allowing the forces of economics to dictate the next steps. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be on the floor and join in this debate. I must, along with my colleague from Oregon, express frustration. This body should be about the vitality of ideas. Whatever those ideas are, in a democracy, there ought to be the willingness to express them. Mr. Blumenauer has detailed, at length, the lack of public hearings. Listen, I get it. This is a messaging opportunity. This has no force of law. All this does is say what the sensibilities are of the Congress. Now, what does the public think of the sensibilities of the Congress? What the public thinks is that we are all bluster and no solution and that we never take the time to sit down and measure twice and then cut. We just simply don't do that in our committees. [[Page H3674]] And so the vitality of ideas, a very noble idea expressed by a Republican, Mr. Inglis, many sessions ago and embraced by many conservative economists in the Reagan, in the Nixon, and in the Bush administrations about providing certainty in terms of what we need to do and a revenue stream that has this at its core: tax pollution--tax pollution--at its source, and pass the savings on to the consumers. We know the volumes that are produced. We know the science behind this. There should be an open and clear-eyed debate on this; but not only a debate about the pros and cons, but how about something refreshing for the American people--a solution. It may not be the bill that I proposed or that Bob Inglis proposed or that any number of people have embraced, but you have major companies, including major oil companies that will be taxed, say, no, this is a sensible way for us to embrace this, and we are enjoined by the very people who this would tax and by conservative economists who say, yeah, we ought to take a look at this not only from the standpoint of the certainty that it will provide, but the known certainty of what pollution does. And it is not just about climate change. It is about the health of the air that we breathe, what we are poisoning in the atmosphere for our children, what happens with respect to the effects of asthma and what happens in terms of the people in coal mines from black lung disease. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. These debilitating diseases scream out for the Congress not to have a message opportunity that may or may not advantage one side or the other in the realm of politics, but how about a solution? How about us doing what Mike Kelly suggested, to work together in the committee to come up with a positive solution as to how to address this? Pass the savings along to the consumer. Develop a revenue system that will, in fact, allow us to rebuild our country that is crumbling around us. Let's take those steps and the responsibility that we all have to the citizens to provide them with solutions, not bluster. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa), a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Committee on Natural Resources. Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Black and Mr. Boustany on these two concurrent resolutions that are being offered today. I appreciate the time. I recall in this debate here that there was a whole movie back in the 1960s called ``If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium.'' Well, if it is tax-raising time, this must be Washington, D.C., because there are more schemes all the time to come hit not just big, evil corporations and big energy producers; this always ends up hitting the bottom line of American working families and the economy. The President's plan to raise a tax on each and every barrel of oil produced by $10 translates out to 25 cents at the pump. We heard earlier some of my colleagues talk about what the carbon tax would mean to working families--much more than they can afford in this bad economy and a time where the jobless rate is higher than is even measurable by this administration. This continues the antidomestically produced energy narrative of this administration. It only hurts U.S. energy jobs and takes productive U.S. fields, such as what we have in California, out of production that are on the margins of being profitable. Instead of having domestically produced energy, we are going to shift more of that burden to other sources: foreign energy or the need for exploring more here or offshore. Why don't we allow the profitable energy and oilfields we have in California and this country to continue to be productive and not hamper them with another additional tax that will take them out of production and rely more on foreign oil? Now, how popular is this amongst regular people? In my own district, we conducted a survey recently where people actually took time to send postcards back into my office that came in at approximately a 90 percent rate in opposition to this $10-per-barrel oil tax, which they understand means 25 cents, again, per gallon at the gas pump. This really, really hurts all Americans. It hurts working families, people on the lower end of the income scale, but even more so, districts like mine that are very rural and all the other rural districts around this country where people have to travel farther to get to their work, to take their kids to school or to healthcare appointments, their ball games, maybe even save up occasionally in this economy for a travel vacation they might like to take and visit the beauty of America. {time} 1000 So the rural economy is even more devastated by this--the rural economy that also would be productive with energy--with these schemes that are being pondered. Additionally, there are other ideas, like a tax on every mile driven, which is being contemplated at some level here federally as well as in my own State. Tax people for every mile they drive, tax them at the gas pump, tax them for carbon. Again, this hits real people in America, not just some idea of a big, evil corporation. The answer in Washington always seems to be more government and taxation that hurts working families. Perhaps first, these dollars should be channeled into projects that people can use. Not more environmental projects, but more highways, more bridges, more water storage. Not boondoggles like we have in California, such as the high- speed rail money pit, or the cost of frivolous environmental measures that drive up the costs of construction projects and sometimes even completely eliminate them. We talk about a green economy a lot, especially on that side of the floor over there. Why don't we focus on a green economy that is not based on importing solar panels from China or wind machines from Europe? How about we get out and do the forestry that is needed to be done to thin the forests? We are talking about the air we breathe. Each summer, for months, the air is brown in northern California--lots of California--and lots of the Western States from forests that are burning because they are not managed, because they are not thinned. Instead, they are overgrown. That would be a green economy. We could turn this into biomass if you want to have real energy that works for the equation of renewable energy. Channel that effort into that instead of chasing these wind machines and solar panels. Mr. Speaker, this is why I support H. Con. Res. 112 and H. Con. Res. 89, to send a message that this is more job-killing taxes and schemes that will fix our economy. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. LaMALFA. It is the freedom to explore for and produce low-cost domestic energy that will help Americans and our economy to recover once again. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney), a gentleman who brings his private sector business success to commonsense solutions in policy. Mr. DELANEY. I want to thank my friend from Oregon for yielding. Mr. Speaker, today, my friends on the other side of the aisle are making four points. The first point they are making is that they don't believe in science, because the science around climate change is unassailable. The second point they are making is that they don't worry about American prosperity, because from an economic perspective and national security, the military, we should be reminded, has called climate change a threat multiplier. This is a very significant risk to long- term American prosperity. The third point they are making is that they don't believe in the power of markets to change behavior at its core. They are not acknowledging the power of a capitalistic economic model to change people's behavior. And the fourth thing they are saying is that they don't trust U.S. businesses to innovate into opportunities and around challenges. [[Page H3675]] These are extraordinary statements. And contrast that with our approach. I have a piece of legislation called the Tax Pollution, Not Profits Act, which puts in place a carbon pricing mechanism, which has been proven to be the most effective way--more effective than a regulatory approach--to change behavior and reverse some of the trends and bend the curve on climate change. We take the revenues that are generated by that bill and we use it to offset all of the costs that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say exist through tax credits to individuals. We set aside money to take care of the retirement of all the coal workers in the United States of America for the rest of their lives, and then we take the remaining revenues and we pay for a significant and substantial cut to business taxes. So this piece of legislation, unlike what my colleagues are proposing, has a double bottom line. It will reverse the negative effects of climate change and the threat to our prosperity, and it is a pro-growth policy because it puts money back in the economy and it makes a bet on U.S. businesses that they can innovate and grow into opportunities and around challenges. It is reflective of the view of businesses in 2016, not the view of businesses from the 1950s. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 9\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 9 minutes remaining. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman), my friend, who has spent a lot of time thinking about these environmental issues and acting on them. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to these two resolutions. The first one, H. Con. Res. 89, says that a carbon tax would necessarily be detrimental to the United States economy. This is false. Plain and simple. The truth is that we can and we must design carbon pollution reduction strategies to spur advancements in clean energy technology, reduce carbon pollution, and fight climate change. These strategies, including a carbon tax or a fee, can easily be designed to be revenue-neutral, and we know from long experience at the State and Federal level that fighting pollution is good for jobs and good for the economy. California is a perfect example. If anyone has questions about this, come to California, where you will see that climate leadership is actually also good economics. It doesn't seem to matter to my colleagues who have offered these resolutions. In the year 2016, they continue to deny the reality of climate change. Literally, our friends across the aisle are the last policymakers on the planet Earth to hold this view. Even in other oil- producing companies, the conservative parties in those countries acknowledge climate change, and they have positions in their party platforms that acknowledge we need to do something about it. Now, the other resolution, H. Con. Res. 112, similarly demonstrates a lack of leadership by opposing President Obama's proposal to finance infrastructure investments. Those who don't support the President's infrastructure financing mechanism, I think, have a responsibility to offer their own solutions for our infrastructure crisis. This bill doesn't do that. Instead, it simply describes a desire to support Big Oil. So here we have it: climate denial; the party that doesn't want to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court; a party that doesn't want to do its job to respond to public health crises, like Zika; a party that prefers not to offer any solutions on our critical infrastructure funding needs. Is this how we are going to make America great again? I don't think so. Let's move forward in the 21st century and not let our energy and infrastructure policies be driven by 18th century thinking. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose both of these bills. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright). Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, we are here debating H. Con. Res. 89, which purports to express the sense of Congress. But really, nothing could be further from the truth, because what it does is express the nonsense of Congress. We are here witnessing the latest example of climate denial brought to the floor by the majority. The entire world agrees that climate change is a pressing problem, except this extreme wing of the Republican Party. Climate change is already affecting people across the globe. As Dr. McDermott from Washington pointed out already, the nonpartisan CBO recently noted the increasing and enormous budgetary impact future storms will have on our Nation, and attributed the majority of this problem to climate change. And I am here to tell you these costs will fall disproportionately on low-income people, low-income communities, and people of color in our country. Are we here on the floor debating a real solution brought forward by the majority? Are we here having hearings? No, we are not. We are here debating a resolution cutting off a solution that economists from all corners of the Earth believe is the most efficient way to address climate change. A properly designed price on carbon can improve the overall performance of the U.S. economy, protect competitiveness, create jobs, promote investment, and lead us toward American energy independence. The gentleman from Oregon is right: instead of debating this resolution, we should be having hearings discussing ways that we can sensibly lead the transition to renewable fuels and clean energy sources. Even big oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell and BP have voiced support for carbon taxes in recent years, acknowledging that climate change is real and that we should be doing something about it. And I say, Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on H. Con. Res. 89, and let's start a real debate, a sensible debate on this existential threat to our Nation and to the globe. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I really appreciate this little window of an opportunity to talk about a carbon tax. I hope that the day will come when we will have an opportunity to have that discussion in a robust and thoughtful way in our Ways and Means Committee. Heaven knows it is important. Lots of people have opinions and ideas. I think we would benefit from it, but I hope that we will have that discussion after we hear from a balanced, wide-ranging group of independent experts across the spectrum to be able to give us meaningful information about it. I include in the Record a letter from Greg Dotson, who is the Vice President for Energy Policy at the Center for American Progress. Center for American Progress, Washington, DC, June 8, 2016. Dear Representative: Later this week, the U.S. House of Representatives will consider H. Con. Res. 89, a resolution that rejects the pricing of carbon pollution. On behalf of the Center for American Progress, I am writing to urge you to oppose this resolution. It is time for Congress to develop sensible policies that address the serious and potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change. Science informs us that we need an urgent solution to this problem. Although the current Administration has made historic progress on climate change, it is clear that we need to do more to achieve additional carbon pollution reductions and lead the world in responding to this global challenge. Top economic advisors to both Democratic and Republican Presidents have expressed their support for putting a price on carbon as an effective and efficient approach for reducing pollution. Joseph Stiglitz, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) under President Bill Clinton, has stated, ``Economic efficiency requires that those who generate emissions pay the cost, and the simplest way of forcing them to do so is through a carbon tax.'' Gregory Mankiw, former Chairman of the CEA under President George W. Bush, has stated, ``Basic economics tells us that when you tax something, you normally get less of it. So if we want to reduce global emissions of carbon, we need a global carbon tax.'' In fact, carbon pollution is already priced in a significant portion of the world. In total, about 40 national jurisdictions and more than 20 cities, states, and regions on [[Page H3676]] five continents--representing almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions--have placed a price on carbon. In the United States, 25 percent of the population lives in a jurisdiction where carbon pollution is currently priced and where one-third of the country's economic activity takes place. The price on carbon in California is the highest of any state in the country at almost $13 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, and yet the California economy is projected to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the United States over the next two years. In recent years, momentum to expand the adoption of carbon pricing policies has been growing. More than 400 investors with more than $24 trillion in assets have called on governments to establish ``stable, economically meaningful carbon pricing.'' Already, more than 1,000 businesses apply a price on carbon to inform their investments and operations or plan to do so in the next two years. In addition, at the United Nations climate talks in Paris last December, governments, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations announced the new Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition to accelerate and expand the adoption of carbon pricing worldwide. In order to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, the United States needs to consider all possible tools at its disposal, including the effective market-based mechanisms of carbon pricing. Members of Congress need to work together on a bipartisan basis to find ways to cut carbon pollution rather than advance polarizing measures that take useful tools off the table. I urge you to reject this ill-advised resolution. Sincerely, Greg Dotson, Vice President for Energy Policy, Center for American Progress. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Let me just read a couple of items from Mr. Dotson's letter. He points out that ``top economic advisors to both Democratic and Republican Presidents have expressed their support for putting a price on carbon as an effective and efficient approach for reducing pollution.'' He cites Gregory Mankiw, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, who says: ``Basic economics tells us that when you tax something, you normally get less of it. So if we want to reduce global emissions of carbon, we need a global carbon tax.'' ``In fact, carbon pollution is already priced in a significant portion of the world. In total, about 40 national jurisdictions and more than 20 cities, states, and regions on five continents-- representing almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions--have placed a price on carbon. In the United States, 25 percent of the population lives in jurisdictions where carbon pollution is currently priced and where one-third of the country's economic activity takes place.'' That is in America right now. There is no acknowledgment of that in this debate. We could have talked about that in the committee. ``The price on carbon in California,'' referenced by my friend, Mr. Huffman, ``is the highest of any state in the country at almost $13 per ton . . . yet the California economy is projected to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the United States over the next two years.'' They reference the fact that ``more than 400 investors with more than $24 trillion in assets have called on governments to establish `stable, economically meaningful carbon pricing.' Already, more than 1,000 businesses apply a price on carbon to inform their investments and operations or plan to do so in the next two years. In addition, at the United Nations climate talks in Paris last December, governments, business, nongovernmental organizations announced the new Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition to accelerate and expand the adoption of carbon pricing worldwide,'' in keeping with what we heard from Prime Minister Modi in this Chamber just 2 days ago. {time} 1015 Yet my friends on the other side of the aisle are not involved with our being able to discuss this in depth, being able to bring in the experts, being able to work together to design a pricing mechanism that avoids some of the cartoon characteristics that they establish here. We had that chance, and we haven't done it. But this will not be the last word. This meaningless resolution will undoubtedly pass today. It is not going to have any impact in terms of the long term. The long term, we are on a path to price carbon, and we have the capacity to do so in a thoughtful and an effective way, like the conservative leaders, whose correspondence I put into the Record earlier, suggest. It can be revenue neutral. It can be effective. It can help reverse the more damaging effects of climate change, and it is a way to promote economic opportunity and global competitiveness. I appreciate the opportunity to express my views on this. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. You know, although my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made this a conversation about climate change--which I agree that we can have and we should have in another venue, and that is in the committee structure--this is about a President who decided on his own, without coming to Congress to discuss this tax, this $10 tax on a barrel of gasoline, because he was unable to get this carbon tax, when, by the way, the House and the Senate were both in his own party, he couldn't even get this passed. So this is a discussion for another day about climate change, which we can all have, and have in a very gentle way. However, let me sum up what this would do if this were to pass, the impact that this carbon tax would have on the American people: It would drive up the cost of energy, which would most affect those at the lower income. It would destroy well-paying jobs in the energy industry, well-paying jobs. Right now, when we look at what our loss of jobs are here in this country, we have the lowest rate of jobs in 6 years. Number three, it would directly hit working families the most, those at the very lowest income, and especially those who are elderly. None of these help to grow our economy and get our economy moving or people back to work or raise their incomes. Therefore, I urge a ``yes'' vote on H. Con. Res. 89. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I include the following letter from opponents of H. Con. Res. 89: June 7, 2016. Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members and supporters, the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose H. Con. Res. 89. This resolution is the latest example of climate action denial being advanced by extreme members of the House of Representatives. Instead of listening to the national security experts, faith leaders, scientists, energy innovators, health professionals and many others who are sounding the alarm on climate change and have implored our nation's elected officials to support action, Rep. Scalise and the co-sponsors of H. Con. Res. 89 appear to be looking for another way to say ``no.'' The sponsors of the resolution have no plan to address climate change and have opposed every proposal to do something about the planet's gravest environmental problem. Many of them don't even accept the scientific fact that climate change is occurring. H. Con. Res. 89 ignores the huge costs that our country is already experiencing due to climate change--costs that fall disproportionately on low-income communities and communities of color. It is clear this resolution is meant to put the interests of the polluting fossil fuel companies ahead of the American public's best interest. Instead of holding another just-for-show vote against climate action, the U.S. House of Representatives should be debating how it can best position our country to lead the global transition to clean energy sources. Last year more than half of the world's new energy came from renewable energy sources and the landmark Paris climate agreement sends a powerful signal to investors that this trend toward low- carbon energy will accelerate. More and more countries and hundreds of forward-looking companies are adopting policies to limit carbon pollution and correct the markets failure to capture the health and environmental costs of burning fossil fuels. At a time when the American taxpayer is already paying to move vulnerable American communities to higher ground because of climate-driven sea level rise, we have no time to waste on empty resolutions that seek to take potential climate solutions off the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the concurrent resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. [[Page H3677]] Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3669-H3677] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT A CARBON TAX WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 767, I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 89) expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the concurrent resolution is considered read. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: H. Con. Res. 89 Whereas a carbon tax is a Federal tax on carbon released from fossil fuels; Whereas a carbon tax will increase energy prices, including the price of gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and home heating oil; Whereas a carbon tax will mean that families and consumers will pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and electricity; Whereas a carbon tax will fall hardest on the poor, the elderly, and those on fixed incomes; Whereas a carbon tax will lead to more jobs and businesses moving overseas; Whereas a carbon tax will lead to less economic growth; Whereas American families will be harmed the most from a carbon tax; Whereas, according to the Energy Information Administration, in 2011, fossil fuels share of energy consumption was 82 percent; Whereas a carbon tax will increase the cost of every good manufactured in the United States; Whereas a carbon tax will impose disproportionate burdens on certain industries, jobs, States, and geographic regions and would further restrict the global competitiveness of the United States; Whereas American ingenuity has led to innovations in energy exploration and development and has increased production of domestic energy resources on private and State-owned land which has created significant job growth and private capital investment; Whereas United States energy policy should encourage continued private sector innovation and development and not increase the existing tax burden on manufacturers; Whereas the production of American energy resources increases the United States ability to maintain a competitive advantage in today's global economy; Whereas a carbon tax would reduce America's global competitiveness and would encourage development abroad in countries that do not impose this exorbitant tax burden; and Whereas the Congress and the President should focus on pro- growth solutions that encourage increased development of domestic resources: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The concurrent resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee. General Leave Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on H. Con. Res. 89, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 89, which takes a strong stand against the carbon tax that would hurt American families, workers, and job creators. As the President closes out his time in office, he would like nothing more than to ram through more of his harmful energy agenda. Just look at the President's budget this year. Among the $3.4 trillion in tax hikes he proposed, the President included a $10 per barrel tax on oil. This tax alone would cause gas prices to increase by an estimated 25 cents per gallon. With a carbon tax, there would be a tax hike on production, distribution, and the use of not only oil but also of natural gas and any other form of energy that emits carbon. Such a tax would have many serious impacts on our economy by making day-to-day life more expensive for families throughout this country. First, a carbon tax could drive up the cost of energy for both the producers and the consumers. This translates to larger energy bills that eat up even more of Americans' take-home pay, especially during the hottest and coldest months of the year. Second, a carbon tax would destroy well-paying jobs throughout the American energy sector--a sector that has fueled significant job growth throughout the country. Third, a carbon tax would deliver a direct hit to working families and have compound effects that would reach all corners of the economy. In fact, a carbon tax would increase the cost of, virtually, every good manufactured or service performed in the United States, including everyday necessities. If a good requires energy to make or transport, which most do, taxes on that energy are, essentially, a tax on that good. As a result, Americans would have to pay more for everything-- from milk to clothing to school supplies. Finally, to make this bad idea even worse, we know that a carbon tax would hurt those who are living in poverty and those who are on fixed incomes more than anyone else. Put simply, a carbon tax would make it harder for us to grow our economy and help working families and small businesses succeed. [[Page H3670]] We all want an all-of-the-above energy approach that supports new innovations, not a targeted tax hike on specific industries. Thanks to the leadership of Whip Scalise, Congress will pass this bill today and send it to the Senate, and we will send a clear message to the people in our districts, as well as to the Obama White House, that we do not support this extreme tax. Instead, we will continue to pass legislation that grows our economy and that helps more Americans get back to work. After all, last week, we received the worst jobs report in almost 6 years. It is more important than ever that we move forward with a bold, pro-growth agenda, not another expensive Washington tax. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. What is happening today is further evidence that the Republicans are simply not doing their job. There is real work to be done. It is simply inexcusable that action has not yet happened to prepare for the Zika virus. That would be real action. Helping the people of Flint get clean drinking water, in my home State, would be something real. There is no budget resolution that has been considered here on the House floor. Raising the minimum wage would also be real, and it would help lift many families out of poverty. Closing tax loopholes and making the Tax Code fairer would be real. Instead, today, we are voting on two senses of Congress resolutions. Doing so provides further evidence that the Republicans not only are not acting on those real problems mentioned earlier but are in denial on another real issue that needs action--climate change. The scientific evidence of climate change is overwhelming, and the consensus is clear, and we have seen the impacts of climate change, virtually, every day in our country and around the world. This week, the CBO, led by a Director appointed by the majority here, released a report that identified the effects of climate change as a potential risk to the Federal budget. According to that report, the cost of hurricane damage is projected to be $35 billion more than it is today because of climate change. The report stated: ``Human activities around the world, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and widespread changes in land use, are producing growing emissions of greenhouse gases.'' Climate change requires all of us, including the Republicans here who are in total denial, to come to our senses and to act on the challenge of climate change. This sense of Congress resolution, like the second one, completely fails to meet that challenge. I urge its rejection. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) control the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), a member of the Ways and Means Committee and the chairman of the Tax Policy Subcommittee. Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my colleague and friend on the Ways and Means Committee, Mrs. Black, for yielding time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 89, a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy. At a time when 80 percent of domestic energy consumption comes from natural gas, from oil, from coal, it is, clearly, counterproductive to make these necessary resources more expensive by imposing an indirect tax on these fuels. A carbon tax means higher utility bills for families, more expensive goods and services for consumers, decreased economic activity, and it would really hurt job creation. We already heard about the dismal numbers last week that were released--38,000 non-farm-related jobs. Let me just be clear. When we were in the recession, one of the prime drivers economically that took us out of the recession was the shale revolution--a real energy renaissance in this country. Mr. Speaker, this type of tax is not just a tax on carbon--it is a tax on working families; it is a tax on the American economy; it is a tax on American competitiveness; it is a tax on our energy security. It strikes right at the foundation of our national security. It is the wrong thing to do. It is a regressive tax. It hurts the people who are most dependent on fixed incomes--seniors. It hurts them most. Why would we even consider doing this? There are better ways to set up taxation for this country that meet our needs. I just don't understand why one would propose this type of tax, other than the fact that there is a radical environmental agenda, which would hurt manufacturing and American competitiveness. We can't do this. We need to grow this economy. We need growth around 3 to 4 percent minimum to create jobs, to let American business create value, to assert American leadership globally. We are not going to do this with a carbon tax. We won't do it. We need pro-growth policies. Mr. Speaker, the American people understand this. A recent study by the Institute for Energy Policy found that over 60 percent of Americans oppose this type of idea. I applaud Whip Scalise for offering this sensible resolution because it then puts forth a very strong, affirmative statement that we are not going to disarm the American economy, that we are not going to strike a blow at American competitiveness when we are struggling already as it is. I am sick and tired of the fact that American leadership is eroding around the world. I am sick and tired of the fact that we are walking around with timidity. We ought to be embracing the concept of American leadership. This gives us an opportunity, based on American innovation and energy--the clearest example of which I know of American exceptionalism--to rewrite the rules of energy security based on open markets, transparent pricing, and diversity of supply source. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to hear my friend from Louisiana with his impassioned presentation today; but his presentation, coming on the heels of what we all heard from the Prime Minister of India--calling for a low carbon, sustainable, innovative future--makes me sad. If we would have had our economy take these issues seriously--maybe have a week of hearings--we would have been able to demonstrate to the gentleman with an impartial panel of independent experts all across the political spectrum--Conservative, Liberal, Republican, and Democrat-- that a carbon tax, revenue neutral, is, actually, the key to the innovative future they want. There are all sorts of ways to design a carbon tax, to, actually, enhance the role--the economic status--of low- and moderate-income people, but we never had a hearing on that. It is just simply dismissed as something that we can't do, but they have done it elsewhere in the world. If the committee had done its job, we would be dealing with facts, not hyperbole. {time} 0930 If the committee had done its job, we would have heard that we have very real challenges today to American security, which our Department of Defense has pointed out. Climate change, despite denial from some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, is a threat today to the American military posture. Climate change is disrupting industries like fishing. It is producing unprecedented flooding, forest fires, and a wildly unpredictable weather future. The reduction of arctic ice at unprecedented levels ought to be of concern to my friends on the other side of the aisle. Maybe if we had some open, honest hearings that were balanced and independent, that case would have been made and they may support it. But whether or not they care about climate change and global warming, a carbon tax makes sense for American innovation, the economy, and our competitiveness. It is the areas of low-carbon energy that have seen the job growth. There are now more people [[Page H3671]] working in wind and solar than the coal industry by far. That is where the job growth has been undertaken. A carbon tax would enhance America's global competitiveness. And if we had hearings, listening to independent experts across the board, that case would be made, and I don't think we would have this foolish resolution on the floor. These are elements that would inject into our energy policy an even, balanced approach using market forces, which are much easier than some of the incentives that we have, which are important, which people on both sides of the aisle have supported in the past. But a carbon tax is a more effective way of achieving those objectives. Now, Mr. Speaker, I am sad that we didn't have that debate in committee. I am sad that we didn't hear from independent experts. I think of our friend Bob Inglis, former Congressperson, who is on a personal crusade working with the evangelical community about the merits of a carbon tax. It would have been great to have heard from Bob and others like him to be able to present a balanced picture and be able to deal with meaningful policy. I still hope that someday, that time will come that our Ways and Means Committee actually takes the time to dive into one of the most important issues of the day and to examine one of the tools that independent experts all across the spectrum agree would be a solid addition and actually simplify the Tax Code while we can help people in low income and small business and provide incentives for America's global competitiveness, like we heard from the Prime Minister of India from that very rostrum just 2 days ago. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a colleague of mine and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black). We see eye to eye on almost everything in our lives, and it is really good to be able to stand here today and speak so strongly in favor of H. Con. Res. 89. I really do appreciate the passion and sincerity of my colleagues across the aisle. What we are talking today is about policy. What we are talking about today is the all-important, unintended consequences that so often are put to blame for bad things that happen to American people. They are well intended, yes, at their conception, but very harmful. We are talking about a carbon tax, $10 a barrel on oil. And we are saying: Well, don't worry about that because that is going to be charged upstream. That is going to be charged when it is taken out of the ground. But we all know that every single tax, every single cost is paid downstream. What do I mean by that? Every day hardworking Americans get up in the morning and want to put a roof over the heads of their families, food on the table, clothes on their back, and a little bit of money put away for their future. But every day we continue to come up with policies that somehow, although well intended, make it harder for them to make a living, make it harder for them to live the American Dream, make it harder for them to get ready for the future. Now, I know there are always going to be existential threats. I get that. My grandson is afraid to get out of bed at night because he thinks there is a monster under it. He thinks that if you get up in the middle of the night, maybe there is somebody in the closet or maybe there is something else. Now, I am not a climate change denier. Of course, the climate changes. I have seen it happen in my life. I have seen it where people say it is getting too cold and now it is getting too warm. Well, you know what? It just changes. I get that. What doesn't change is the assault on the American people to pick up the tab on all of these costs. There is nothing that makes less sense to me than what we are doing. And back home where I come from, there is an old saying that goes something like this: Measure twice and cut once. Why? Because once you do that cut, it is permanent. That is why you want to measure twice to make sure that the cut you make is the right cut. That is why you need to take the policies that affect everyday American people and make sure that you are not hurting them. Well intended, I get it. I know it is well intended. I just don't think the American people have to pay the brunt of this. I am very aware of the Prime Minister of India being here Wednesday. And I also know that between India and China, that is where the greatest pollution comes from. I get it. I get it. Putting $10 a barrel on oil coming out of the ground just doesn't make sense. I would just like my friends on both sides of the aisle to think about somebody named Steven Jobs. Steven Jobs did not invent the PC because we taxed typewriters too high and caused the cost of that. Innovation, of course, is the answer. And we have seen great innovation. I know where I am from in western Pennsylvania, that clean coal is real. But the President promised, when he was running as a candidate, that he would put those who chose to make electricity by burning coal out of business. So we regulate them to the point where it is no longer cost efficient to do that, but we keep moving that way. The fact that 40,000 Pennsylvanians make a living that way, well, don't worry about that, they will have to find something else to do. You can go down to West Virginia and you can hear where candidates told them: Listen, you are going to be out of business, but we will find something else for you to do and we will just get to that later. Look, we have an opportunity today. This is a sense of Congress to tell the American people what it is that we think goes on with this policy. For far too long we have turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to the people who sent us here to represent them. We talk very loftily about what it is that we would like to see, how it is that we would like it to go, our dream for the future. But we forget that every day, hardworking American taxpayers get up, throw their feet out over the side of the bed, and go to work for a very particular reason: their families, their churches, their schools, their communities and, more importantly, all of America. Well intended, yes. But the results would be devastating. And who would pay this carbon tax? Who would pay this $10 a barrel? It would be any man or woman who has to go out and buy anything for his or her family. It would be reflected in the cost of everything we put on our backs and everything we put in our mouths. It would affect everything we do when we travel from one point to another, but we say it is necessary. It is necessary because we have to tax this so high that we drive people away from it. I would hope that we could come together in America's House and do what is right for America's people, to do what is right for the people who sent us here to represent them because they are working so hard to make sure that there is a future for their children. In the last month when we created one job for every 8,000 Americans-- one job for every 8,000 Americans, are you kidding me?--in the greatest country the world has ever known, in a Nation that leads the world in defending freedom and liberty, in a Nation that knows that the best way to help others is through American participation---- The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I do want to make sure that this final point comes across: We can work together for solutions. We can work together to do the same things for the same people that we all came here to represent. I do not think that there are ill-intended ideas on the other side. I think they are well-intended. I just think they are wrong. I think they are wrong for the times, and I think they are wrong for the American people. As I said earlier, where I am from, there are a lot of old adages. And one of them is: don't worry about the mule, just load the wagon. I will tell you right now that the mule is trying to find a way to unhook [[Page H3672]] itself from the wagon because that load has gotten too heavy to pay. I know that the people who are loading the wagon think it is okay because at some point, that is going to have to be delivered somewhere. The truth of the matter is it is not. We have put too heavy a burden on American taxpayers, hardworking American taxpayers, hardworking Americans. 1.4 million American lives have been sacrificed for the freedom and liberty not just of this country--our country and our Nation--but for the whole world. So I say let's be careful before we do these well-intended but careless things. Let's be careful before we turn our backs on the people who we actually represent here, and that is hardworking American people. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I couldn't agree more with my good friend from Butler, Pennsylvania, that we can actually come together and fashion solutions. That is why it is such a tragedy that this resolution comes to the floor without ever having our committee work on it, because we could have had hearings that could have narrowed those gaps. I include in the Record a letter from six conservative advocates for climate change action. June 7, 2016. Dear Representative: Later this week Congress will take up a resolution sponsored by Congressman Scalise (R-LA1) that expresses the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the economy of the United States. We are concerned that this resolution offers a limited perspective on carbon taxes and is blind to the potential benefits of market-based climate policy. Legislation that incorporates a carbon tax could include regulatory and tax reforms to make the United States economy more competitive, innovative, and robust, benefiting both present and future generations. We recognize that a carbon tax, like any tax, will impose economic costs. But climate change is also imposing economic costs. This resolution falls short by recognizing the cost of action without considering the cost of staying on our present policy course. There are, of course, uncertainties about the future cost of climate change and, likewise, the cost associated with a carbon tax (much would depend on program design and the pace and nature of technological progress). The need for action, however, is clear. A recent survey of economists who publish in leading peer-reviewed journals on these matters found that 93% believe that a meaningful policy response to climate change is warranted. The least burdensome, most straightforward, and most market-friendly means of addressing climate change is to price the risks imposed by greenhouse gas emissions via a tax. This would harness price signals, rather than regulations, to guide market response. That is why carbon pricing has the support of free market economists, a majority of the global business community, and a large number of the largest multinational private oil and gas companies in the world (the corporate entities among the most directly affected by climate policy). In reaching a conclusion, this resolution neglects the fact that the United States already has a multiplicity of carbon taxes. They are imposed, however, via dozens of federal and state regulations, are invisible to consumers, unevenly imposed across industrial sectors, unnecessarily costly, and growing in size and scope. The policy choice is not if we should price carbon emissions, but how. Unfortunately, this resolution also fails to differentiate between proposals that would impose carbon taxes on top of existing regulations (chiefly the Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan), and proposals that would impose carbon taxes in place of those existing regulations. Conservatives and free market advocates should embrace the latter, regardless of how they view climate risks. An economy-wide carbon tax that replaces existing regulatory interventions could reduce the cost of climate policy and deregulate the economy. It could also provide revenue to support pro-growth tax reform, including corporate income or payroll tax cuts, which could dramatically reduce overall costs on the economy. Revenues could be applied to compensate those who suffer the most from higher energy costs; the poor, the elderly, and individuals and families living on fixed incomes. Unfortunately, none of those options are presently available because Members of Congress have neglected opportunities to design and debate market-friendly climate policies in legislation. Instead, they have yielded authority in climate policy design to the Executive Branch. By discouraging a long-overdue discussion about sensible carbon pricing, this resolution frustrates the development of better policy. Sincerely, Jerry Taylor, President, Niskanen Center. Bob Inglis, Executive Director, RepublicEn. Aparna Mathur, Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute. Eli Lehrer, President, R Street Institute. The Rev. Mitchell C. Hescox, President, Evangelical Environmental Network. Alan Viard, Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Pennsylvania could have heard them talk about the need for action and how you can design a carbon tax that meets the objectives he is talking about, but we never did that. We didn't listen to experts across the spectrum--Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, economists, and scientists--to be able to examine the facts. Instead, we have a cartoon proposal that they are arguing against as opposed to something that we could have worked on together that is promoted by most of the independent experts in the field. And someday within our lifetime this Congress will consider and, I think, probably approve. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Seattle, Washington (Mr. McDermott), who has looked at some of these challenges around the globe. Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, as I come to speak on the floor, I think I am in the House of the deniers. Now, in 2007, that liberal journal, National Geographic, had an article called ``The Big Thaw.'' And it says: ``It's no surprise that a warming climate is melting the world's glaciers and polar ice. But no one expected it to happen this fast.'' That was in 2007. That was 9 years ago. I was taken, along with Gerry Connolly, up to the Arctic with the Norweigian Government. They are worried about what is happening. This resolution is just burying your head in the sand. I think you are thinking that if you put your head in the sand long enough, it will go away and, when you pull your head out, it won't be there. The CBO just put a report out: Texas, Louisiana, and Florida are going to have hurricane damage that is unbelievable. FEMA already accounts for 45 percent of money spent on hurricane damage, $95 billion since 2000. Now, if you think the insurance companies are going to keep insuring against hurricanes, you have another thing coming. At some point, they are going to say: We are not doing hurricane insurance in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and a whole bunch of other places. That is the economics. You say: Let's not pay anything right now, let's not change anything, let's not work on it. But if we don't work on it, we are going to pay later. I am old enough to remember a FRAM commercial on the television. It was an air cleaner on your car, and it said: Pay me now or pay me later. And this is what this is about today. Now, there are things going on in this country which just absolutely boggle my mind. In North Carolina, the assembly got together and they said: You know what? We are not going to spend any money to measure the sea levels. Now, you have hundreds of miles of coastline in North Carolina where the sea is rising and property values are going to be lost. We are talking money here. We are not talking soft, liberal stuff. This is real, and people don't want to even look at it. In Florida and Wisconsin, they took a novel approach and they said: We are not even going to use the words ``climate change'' in anything. Now, here in Congress, the climate deniers take many forms, from blocking the words ``social cost of carbon'' to directing the Department of Defense to ignore climate change. All the while, the DOD itself highlights the threat of climate change to national security. Republicans like to talk about national security. {time} 0945 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. McDERMOTT. If you are serious about talking about national security, [[Page H3673]] you better start talking about the climate change that is going on in the world. Sea lanes across the North Pole are coming, boats are already coming, we are building the Panama Canal wider, and it is opening up on the north end of the globe. Now, this absurdity cannot last, and we have got to begin to do what Mr. Blumenauer suggested. There have to be hearings. Bob Inglis, I knew him when he was here. God, he was a wild-eyed liberal. I couldn't believe what a wild-eyed liberal he was. He came down here talking about a carbon tax. I had a carbon tax. Mr. Larson had a carbon tax. This is not a partisan issue, Democrat versus Republican; it is whether or not you are going to look at the science of what is happening on the globe. I urge people to vote ``no'' on this. You will come back and do it in a couple of years. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our majority whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for yielding. I am proud to bring forward this legislation, Mr. Speaker, that expresses the strong sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy. If you look at what this administration has done through radical rules and regulations, through all of its agencies, starting with the EPA, with the IRS, with the NLRB, the whole alphabet soup of Federal agencies that every morning wake up trying to figure out how to make it harder for our economy to get moving again, how to make it harder for people to create jobs in America, frankly, the results of these radical regulations are shifting and running jobs away, out of our country to foreign countries like China, like India, and they want to keep it going. This is not a new concept, Mr. Speaker. They tried this years ago when they brought through the cap-and-trade bill. Passed out of the House, it couldn't even pass in the Senate when they had a supermajority in the Senate with 60 votes because it was such a detrimental idea that would devastate our economy. Yet even with that defeat, President Obama still tries to come back with a carbon tax through other means, whether it is regulations or whether it is superimposed carbon taxes through the EPA and some of the other things they are doing. We have had hearings on this, Mr. Speaker. There is data all around that confirms how devastating a carbon tax would be to the United States economy. You can just look at what some of the outside groups that look at this said. The National Association of Manufacturers, the people that make things in America, have confirmed we would lose more than a million jobs in America if a carbon tax was imposed. Where would those jobs go? They would go to countries, ironically, that don't have the good environmental standards we already have. So they would go to countries like China and India where, if you are concerned about carbon going into the atmosphere, the things that they do to produce the same things we produce here in America, it creates more than five times the amount of carbon in those countries. So you are shifting jobs out of America to send it to countries where you would actually create more carbon. They talk about somehow being able to create policy that will stop hurricanes and change the sea level rising, for goodness sake, as if some policy is going to do that. By the way, the result of their policies will increase carbon in the Earth's atmosphere. But let's not even talk about that. Let's actually talk about the track record of this administration that now wants to control the Earth's temperature. They spent over $500 million and couldn't even create a Web site to take your health insurance requests, healthcare.gov. Remember that? Well, this same group now thinks they can control the Earth's temperature through radical policies. Again, let's look at the devastating impact these policies would have. They wouldn't work, first of all, but they would have a devastating impact on the middle class of this country. The Congressional Budget Office, our own Congressional Budget Office that looked at this, said a carbon tax would actually hit low-income people the hardest, even harder than high-income people. It would have a devastating impact on those people who are least able to afford it because it would increase the cost of everything they do. It would increase your food costs at the grocery store. It would increase, of course, what you pay at the pump. It would increase your electricity prices. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman. Mr. SCALISE. The Heritage Foundation looked at this and said that this kind of carbon tax would actually increase the cost of everything that families buy by over $1,400 per family. Families are going to pay $1,400 more every year for the cost of a carbon tax that the other side wants to defend. And to yield what? To just yield an opportunity for countries like China and India to grow their economies at the expense of ours. So, Mr. Speaker, if you look at what they are trying to do--and, again, if you want to do this, bring it forward as an idea in legislation. They tried it with cap-and-trade, and it got defeated when Democrats controlled everything. There is bipartisanship on this issue, and the bipartisanship is in opposition to a carbon tax. So why don't we go on record and be very clear about it, not just that it is bad policy, but also to reaffirm how devastating it would be for the United States economy. It shouldn't move forward. The President needs to stop this radical agenda and instead focus on reversing the depressing economic activity that we have seen in this country since he has been President because of these kinds of policies. Let's get real economic growth. Let's bring those jobs back to the United States. Let's reject a carbon tax. I urge adoption of this resolution. Mr. BLUMENAUER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed my friend from Louisiana's impassioned presentation. It is too bad that the Committee on Ways and Means didn't actually sit down and go through the elements that would be in a balanced carbon tax. He is debating a cartoon version, not one that we worked on. I am going to yield, in a moment, to one of the gentlemen who, earlier in this carbon debate several Congresses ago, has been involved with crafting a realistic carbon tax. We had the reference to the inability to move the cap-and-trade, which I don't think is as good as a carbon tax. It failed because there were a minority of the Senate who were opposed to allowing it to go forward. It wasn't that we didn't have a majority that were interested. In the Senate, you can have a veto with 41 people who are decided that they are not going to allow things to move forward. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson). He has been a student of a carbon tax, who has listened to those people across the political spectrum and has been a champion of a reasonable, thoughtful approach to promote American innovation. I would just point out the areas where we have had the greatest job growth in the energy sector have not been petroleum or coal. It has been solar and wind. A carbon tax would help accelerate that by leveling the playing field and allowing the forces of economics to dictate the next steps. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be on the floor and join in this debate. I must, along with my colleague from Oregon, express frustration. This body should be about the vitality of ideas. Whatever those ideas are, in a democracy, there ought to be the willingness to express them. Mr. Blumenauer has detailed, at length, the lack of public hearings. Listen, I get it. This is a messaging opportunity. This has no force of law. All this does is say what the sensibilities are of the Congress. Now, what does the public think of the sensibilities of the Congress? What the public thinks is that we are all bluster and no solution and that we never take the time to sit down and measure twice and then cut. We just simply don't do that in our committees. [[Page H3674]] And so the vitality of ideas, a very noble idea expressed by a Republican, Mr. Inglis, many sessions ago and embraced by many conservative economists in the Reagan, in the Nixon, and in the Bush administrations about providing certainty in terms of what we need to do and a revenue stream that has this at its core: tax pollution--tax pollution--at its source, and pass the savings on to the consumers. We know the volumes that are produced. We know the science behind this. There should be an open and clear-eyed debate on this; but not only a debate about the pros and cons, but how about something refreshing for the American people--a solution. It may not be the bill that I proposed or that Bob Inglis proposed or that any number of people have embraced, but you have major companies, including major oil companies that will be taxed, say, no, this is a sensible way for us to embrace this, and we are enjoined by the very people who this would tax and by conservative economists who say, yeah, we ought to take a look at this not only from the standpoint of the certainty that it will provide, but the known certainty of what pollution does. And it is not just about climate change. It is about the health of the air that we breathe, what we are poisoning in the atmosphere for our children, what happens with respect to the effects of asthma and what happens in terms of the people in coal mines from black lung disease. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. These debilitating diseases scream out for the Congress not to have a message opportunity that may or may not advantage one side or the other in the realm of politics, but how about a solution? How about us doing what Mike Kelly suggested, to work together in the committee to come up with a positive solution as to how to address this? Pass the savings along to the consumer. Develop a revenue system that will, in fact, allow us to rebuild our country that is crumbling around us. Let's take those steps and the responsibility that we all have to the citizens to provide them with solutions, not bluster. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa), a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Committee on Natural Resources. Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Black and Mr. Boustany on these two concurrent resolutions that are being offered today. I appreciate the time. I recall in this debate here that there was a whole movie back in the 1960s called ``If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium.'' Well, if it is tax-raising time, this must be Washington, D.C., because there are more schemes all the time to come hit not just big, evil corporations and big energy producers; this always ends up hitting the bottom line of American working families and the economy. The President's plan to raise a tax on each and every barrel of oil produced by $10 translates out to 25 cents at the pump. We heard earlier some of my colleagues talk about what the carbon tax would mean to working families--much more than they can afford in this bad economy and a time where the jobless rate is higher than is even measurable by this administration. This continues the antidomestically produced energy narrative of this administration. It only hurts U.S. energy jobs and takes productive U.S. fields, such as what we have in California, out of production that are on the margins of being profitable. Instead of having domestically produced energy, we are going to shift more of that burden to other sources: foreign energy or the need for exploring more here or offshore. Why don't we allow the profitable energy and oilfields we have in California and this country to continue to be productive and not hamper them with another additional tax that will take them out of production and rely more on foreign oil? Now, how popular is this amongst regular people? In my own district, we conducted a survey recently where people actually took time to send postcards back into my office that came in at approximately a 90 percent rate in opposition to this $10-per-barrel oil tax, which they understand means 25 cents, again, per gallon at the gas pump. This really, really hurts all Americans. It hurts working families, people on the lower end of the income scale, but even more so, districts like mine that are very rural and all the other rural districts around this country where people have to travel farther to get to their work, to take their kids to school or to healthcare appointments, their ball games, maybe even save up occasionally in this economy for a travel vacation they might like to take and visit the beauty of America. {time} 1000 So the rural economy is even more devastated by this--the rural economy that also would be productive with energy--with these schemes that are being pondered. Additionally, there are other ideas, like a tax on every mile driven, which is being contemplated at some level here federally as well as in my own State. Tax people for every mile they drive, tax them at the gas pump, tax them for carbon. Again, this hits real people in America, not just some idea of a big, evil corporation. The answer in Washington always seems to be more government and taxation that hurts working families. Perhaps first, these dollars should be channeled into projects that people can use. Not more environmental projects, but more highways, more bridges, more water storage. Not boondoggles like we have in California, such as the high- speed rail money pit, or the cost of frivolous environmental measures that drive up the costs of construction projects and sometimes even completely eliminate them. We talk about a green economy a lot, especially on that side of the floor over there. Why don't we focus on a green economy that is not based on importing solar panels from China or wind machines from Europe? How about we get out and do the forestry that is needed to be done to thin the forests? We are talking about the air we breathe. Each summer, for months, the air is brown in northern California--lots of California--and lots of the Western States from forests that are burning because they are not managed, because they are not thinned. Instead, they are overgrown. That would be a green economy. We could turn this into biomass if you want to have real energy that works for the equation of renewable energy. Channel that effort into that instead of chasing these wind machines and solar panels. Mr. Speaker, this is why I support H. Con. Res. 112 and H. Con. Res. 89, to send a message that this is more job-killing taxes and schemes that will fix our economy. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. LaMALFA. It is the freedom to explore for and produce low-cost domestic energy that will help Americans and our economy to recover once again. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney), a gentleman who brings his private sector business success to commonsense solutions in policy. Mr. DELANEY. I want to thank my friend from Oregon for yielding. Mr. Speaker, today, my friends on the other side of the aisle are making four points. The first point they are making is that they don't believe in science, because the science around climate change is unassailable. The second point they are making is that they don't worry about American prosperity, because from an economic perspective and national security, the military, we should be reminded, has called climate change a threat multiplier. This is a very significant risk to long- term American prosperity. The third point they are making is that they don't believe in the power of markets to change behavior at its core. They are not acknowledging the power of a capitalistic economic model to change people's behavior. And the fourth thing they are saying is that they don't trust U.S. businesses to innovate into opportunities and around challenges. [[Page H3675]] These are extraordinary statements. And contrast that with our approach. I have a piece of legislation called the Tax Pollution, Not Profits Act, which puts in place a carbon pricing mechanism, which has been proven to be the most effective way--more effective than a regulatory approach--to change behavior and reverse some of the trends and bend the curve on climate change. We take the revenues that are generated by that bill and we use it to offset all of the costs that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say exist through tax credits to individuals. We set aside money to take care of the retirement of all the coal workers in the United States of America for the rest of their lives, and then we take the remaining revenues and we pay for a significant and substantial cut to business taxes. So this piece of legislation, unlike what my colleagues are proposing, has a double bottom line. It will reverse the negative effects of climate change and the threat to our prosperity, and it is a pro-growth policy because it puts money back in the economy and it makes a bet on U.S. businesses that they can innovate and grow into opportunities and around challenges. It is reflective of the view of businesses in 2016, not the view of businesses from the 1950s. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 9\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 9 minutes remaining. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman), my friend, who has spent a lot of time thinking about these environmental issues and acting on them. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to these two resolutions. The first one, H. Con. Res. 89, says that a carbon tax would necessarily be detrimental to the United States economy. This is false. Plain and simple. The truth is that we can and we must design carbon pollution reduction strategies to spur advancements in clean energy technology, reduce carbon pollution, and fight climate change. These strategies, including a carbon tax or a fee, can easily be designed to be revenue-neutral, and we know from long experience at the State and Federal level that fighting pollution is good for jobs and good for the economy. California is a perfect example. If anyone has questions about this, come to California, where you will see that climate leadership is actually also good economics. It doesn't seem to matter to my colleagues who have offered these resolutions. In the year 2016, they continue to deny the reality of climate change. Literally, our friends across the aisle are the last policymakers on the planet Earth to hold this view. Even in other oil- producing companies, the conservative parties in those countries acknowledge climate change, and they have positions in their party platforms that acknowledge we need to do something about it. Now, the other resolution, H. Con. Res. 112, similarly demonstrates a lack of leadership by opposing President Obama's proposal to finance infrastructure investments. Those who don't support the President's infrastructure financing mechanism, I think, have a responsibility to offer their own solutions for our infrastructure crisis. This bill doesn't do that. Instead, it simply describes a desire to support Big Oil. So here we have it: climate denial; the party that doesn't want to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court; a party that doesn't want to do its job to respond to public health crises, like Zika; a party that prefers not to offer any solutions on our critical infrastructure funding needs. Is this how we are going to make America great again? I don't think so. Let's move forward in the 21st century and not let our energy and infrastructure policies be driven by 18th century thinking. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose both of these bills. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright). Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, we are here debating H. Con. Res. 89, which purports to express the sense of Congress. But really, nothing could be further from the truth, because what it does is express the nonsense of Congress. We are here witnessing the latest example of climate denial brought to the floor by the majority. The entire world agrees that climate change is a pressing problem, except this extreme wing of the Republican Party. Climate change is already affecting people across the globe. As Dr. McDermott from Washington pointed out already, the nonpartisan CBO recently noted the increasing and enormous budgetary impact future storms will have on our Nation, and attributed the majority of this problem to climate change. And I am here to tell you these costs will fall disproportionately on low-income people, low-income communities, and people of color in our country. Are we here on the floor debating a real solution brought forward by the majority? Are we here having hearings? No, we are not. We are here debating a resolution cutting off a solution that economists from all corners of the Earth believe is the most efficient way to address climate change. A properly designed price on carbon can improve the overall performance of the U.S. economy, protect competitiveness, create jobs, promote investment, and lead us toward American energy independence. The gentleman from Oregon is right: instead of debating this resolution, we should be having hearings discussing ways that we can sensibly lead the transition to renewable fuels and clean energy sources. Even big oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell and BP have voiced support for carbon taxes in recent years, acknowledging that climate change is real and that we should be doing something about it. And I say, Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on H. Con. Res. 89, and let's start a real debate, a sensible debate on this existential threat to our Nation and to the globe. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I really appreciate this little window of an opportunity to talk about a carbon tax. I hope that the day will come when we will have an opportunity to have that discussion in a robust and thoughtful way in our Ways and Means Committee. Heaven knows it is important. Lots of people have opinions and ideas. I think we would benefit from it, but I hope that we will have that discussion after we hear from a balanced, wide-ranging group of independent experts across the spectrum to be able to give us meaningful information about it. I include in the Record a letter from Greg Dotson, who is the Vice President for Energy Policy at the Center for American Progress. Center for American Progress, Washington, DC, June 8, 2016. Dear Representative: Later this week, the U.S. House of Representatives will consider H. Con. Res. 89, a resolution that rejects the pricing of carbon pollution. On behalf of the Center for American Progress, I am writing to urge you to oppose this resolution. It is time for Congress to develop sensible policies that address the serious and potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change. Science informs us that we need an urgent solution to this problem. Although the current Administration has made historic progress on climate change, it is clear that we need to do more to achieve additional carbon pollution reductions and lead the world in responding to this global challenge. Top economic advisors to both Democratic and Republican Presidents have expressed their support for putting a price on carbon as an effective and efficient approach for reducing pollution. Joseph Stiglitz, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) under President Bill Clinton, has stated, ``Economic efficiency requires that those who generate emissions pay the cost, and the simplest way of forcing them to do so is through a carbon tax.'' Gregory Mankiw, former Chairman of the CEA under President George W. Bush, has stated, ``Basic economics tells us that when you tax something, you normally get less of it. So if we want to reduce global emissions of carbon, we need a global carbon tax.'' In fact, carbon pollution is already priced in a significant portion of the world. In total, about 40 national jurisdictions and more than 20 cities, states, and regions on [[Page H3676]] five continents--representing almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions--have placed a price on carbon. In the United States, 25 percent of the population lives in a jurisdiction where carbon pollution is currently priced and where one-third of the country's economic activity takes place. The price on carbon in California is the highest of any state in the country at almost $13 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, and yet the California economy is projected to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the United States over the next two years. In recent years, momentum to expand the adoption of carbon pricing policies has been growing. More than 400 investors with more than $24 trillion in assets have called on governments to establish ``stable, economically meaningful carbon pricing.'' Already, more than 1,000 businesses apply a price on carbon to inform their investments and operations or plan to do so in the next two years. In addition, at the United Nations climate talks in Paris last December, governments, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations announced the new Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition to accelerate and expand the adoption of carbon pricing worldwide. In order to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, the United States needs to consider all possible tools at its disposal, including the effective market-based mechanisms of carbon pricing. Members of Congress need to work together on a bipartisan basis to find ways to cut carbon pollution rather than advance polarizing measures that take useful tools off the table. I urge you to reject this ill-advised resolution. Sincerely, Greg Dotson, Vice President for Energy Policy, Center for American Progress. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Let me just read a couple of items from Mr. Dotson's letter. He points out that ``top economic advisors to both Democratic and Republican Presidents have expressed their support for putting a price on carbon as an effective and efficient approach for reducing pollution.'' He cites Gregory Mankiw, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, who says: ``Basic economics tells us that when you tax something, you normally get less of it. So if we want to reduce global emissions of carbon, we need a global carbon tax.'' ``In fact, carbon pollution is already priced in a significant portion of the world. In total, about 40 national jurisdictions and more than 20 cities, states, and regions on five continents-- representing almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions--have placed a price on carbon. In the United States, 25 percent of the population lives in jurisdictions where carbon pollution is currently priced and where one-third of the country's economic activity takes place.'' That is in America right now. There is no acknowledgment of that in this debate. We could have talked about that in the committee. ``The price on carbon in California,'' referenced by my friend, Mr. Huffman, ``is the highest of any state in the country at almost $13 per ton . . . yet the California economy is projected to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the United States over the next two years.'' They reference the fact that ``more than 400 investors with more than $24 trillion in assets have called on governments to establish `stable, economically meaningful carbon pricing.' Already, more than 1,000 businesses apply a price on carbon to inform their investments and operations or plan to do so in the next two years. In addition, at the United Nations climate talks in Paris last December, governments, business, nongovernmental organizations announced the new Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition to accelerate and expand the adoption of carbon pricing worldwide,'' in keeping with what we heard from Prime Minister Modi in this Chamber just 2 days ago. {time} 1015 Yet my friends on the other side of the aisle are not involved with our being able to discuss this in depth, being able to bring in the experts, being able to work together to design a pricing mechanism that avoids some of the cartoon characteristics that they establish here. We had that chance, and we haven't done it. But this will not be the last word. This meaningless resolution will undoubtedly pass today. It is not going to have any impact in terms of the long term. The long term, we are on a path to price carbon, and we have the capacity to do so in a thoughtful and an effective way, like the conservative leaders, whose correspondence I put into the Record earlier, suggest. It can be revenue neutral. It can be effective. It can help reverse the more damaging effects of climate change, and it is a way to promote economic opportunity and global competitiveness. I appreciate the opportunity to express my views on this. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. You know, although my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made this a conversation about climate change--which I agree that we can have and we should have in another venue, and that is in the committee structure--this is about a President who decided on his own, without coming to Congress to discuss this tax, this $10 tax on a barrel of gasoline, because he was unable to get this carbon tax, when, by the way, the House and the Senate were both in his own party, he couldn't even get this passed. So this is a discussion for another day about climate change, which we can all have, and have in a very gentle way. However, let me sum up what this would do if this were to pass, the impact that this carbon tax would have on the American people: It would drive up the cost of energy, which would most affect those at the lower income. It would destroy well-paying jobs in the energy industry, well-paying jobs. Right now, when we look at what our loss of jobs are here in this country, we have the lowest rate of jobs in 6 years. Number three, it would directly hit working families the most, those at the very lowest income, and especially those who are elderly. None of these help to grow our economy and get our economy moving or people back to work or raise their incomes. Therefore, I urge a ``yes'' vote on H. Con. Res. 89. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I include the following letter from opponents of H. Con. Res. 89: June 7, 2016. Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members and supporters, the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose H. Con. Res. 89. This resolution is the latest example of climate action denial being advanced by extreme members of the House of Representatives. Instead of listening to the national security experts, faith leaders, scientists, energy innovators, health professionals and many others who are sounding the alarm on climate change and have implored our nation's elected officials to support action, Rep. Scalise and the co-sponsors of H. Con. Res. 89 appear to be looking for another way to say ``no.'' The sponsors of the resolution have no plan to address climate change and have opposed every proposal to do something about the planet's gravest environmental problem. Many of them don't even accept the scientific fact that climate change is occurring. H. Con. Res. 89 ignores the huge costs that our country is already experiencing due to climate change--costs that fall disproportionately on low-income communities and communities of color. It is clear this resolution is meant to put the interests of the polluting fossil fuel companies ahead of the American public's best interest. Instead of holding another just-for-show vote against climate action, the U.S. House of Representatives should be debating how it can best position our country to lead the global transition to clean energy sources. Last year more than half of the world's new energy came from renewable energy sources and the landmark Paris climate agreement sends a powerful signal to investors that this trend toward low- carbon energy will accelerate. More and more countries and hundreds of forward-looking companies are adopting policies to limit carbon pollution and correct the markets failure to capture the health and environmental costs of burning fossil fuels. At a time when the American taxpayer is already paying to move vulnerable American communities to higher ground because of climate-driven sea level rise, we have no time to waste on empty resolutions that seek to take potential climate solutions off the table. Sincerely, Center for Biological Diversity, Clean Water Action, Earthjustice, Environment America, Environmental Defense Action Fund, Fresh Energy, League of Conservation Voters, League of Women Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, Southern Environmental Law Center, Union of Concerned Scientists. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the concurrent resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. [[Page H3677]] Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3669-H3677] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT A CARBON TAX WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 767, I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 89) expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the concurrent resolution is considered read. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: H. Con. Res. 89 Whereas a carbon tax is a Federal tax on carbon released from fossil fuels; Whereas a carbon tax will increase energy prices, including the price of gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and home heating oil; Whereas a carbon tax will mean that families and consumers will pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and electricity; Whereas a carbon tax will fall hardest on the poor, the elderly, and those on fixed incomes; Whereas a carbon tax will lead to more jobs and businesses moving overseas; Whereas a carbon tax will lead to less economic growth; Whereas American families will be harmed the most from a carbon tax; Whereas, according to the Energy Information Administration, in 2011, fossil fuels share of energy consumption was 82 percent; Whereas a carbon tax will increase the cost of every good manufactured in the United States; Whereas a carbon tax will impose disproportionate burdens on certain industries, jobs, States, and geographic regions and would further restrict the global competitiveness of the United States; Whereas American ingenuity has led to innovations in energy exploration and development and has increased production of domestic energy resources on private and State-owned land which has created significant job growth and private capital investment; Whereas United States energy policy should encourage continued private sector innovation and development and not increase the existing tax burden on manufacturers; Whereas the production of American energy resources increases the United States ability to maintain a competitive advantage in today's global economy; Whereas a carbon tax would reduce America's global competitiveness and would encourage development abroad in countries that do not impose this exorbitant tax burden; and Whereas the Congress and the President should focus on pro- growth solutions that encourage increased development of domestic resources: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The concurrent resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee. General Leave Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on H. Con. Res. 89, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 89, which takes a strong stand against the carbon tax that would hurt American families, workers, and job creators. As the President closes out his time in office, he would like nothing more than to ram through more of his harmful energy agenda. Just look at the President's budget this year. Among the $3.4 trillion in tax hikes he proposed, the President included a $10 per barrel tax on oil. This tax alone would cause gas prices to increase by an estimated 25 cents per gallon. With a carbon tax, there would be a tax hike on production, distribution, and the use of not only oil but also of natural gas and any other form of energy that emits carbon. Such a tax would have many serious impacts on our economy by making day-to-day life more expensive for families throughout this country. First, a carbon tax could drive up the cost of energy for both the producers and the consumers. This translates to larger energy bills that eat up even more of Americans' take-home pay, especially during the hottest and coldest months of the year. Second, a carbon tax would destroy well-paying jobs throughout the American energy sector--a sector that has fueled significant job growth throughout the country. Third, a carbon tax would deliver a direct hit to working families and have compound effects that would reach all corners of the economy. In fact, a carbon tax would increase the cost of, virtually, every good manufactured or service performed in the United States, including everyday necessities. If a good requires energy to make or transport, which most do, taxes on that energy are, essentially, a tax on that good. As a result, Americans would have to pay more for everything-- from milk to clothing to school supplies. Finally, to make this bad idea even worse, we know that a carbon tax would hurt those who are living in poverty and those who are on fixed incomes more than anyone else. Put simply, a carbon tax would make it harder for us to grow our economy and help working families and small businesses succeed. [[Page H3670]] We all want an all-of-the-above energy approach that supports new innovations, not a targeted tax hike on specific industries. Thanks to the leadership of Whip Scalise, Congress will pass this bill today and send it to the Senate, and we will send a clear message to the people in our districts, as well as to the Obama White House, that we do not support this extreme tax. Instead, we will continue to pass legislation that grows our economy and that helps more Americans get back to work. After all, last week, we received the worst jobs report in almost 6 years. It is more important than ever that we move forward with a bold, pro-growth agenda, not another expensive Washington tax. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. What is happening today is further evidence that the Republicans are simply not doing their job. There is real work to be done. It is simply inexcusable that action has not yet happened to prepare for the Zika virus. That would be real action. Helping the people of Flint get clean drinking water, in my home State, would be something real. There is no budget resolution that has been considered here on the House floor. Raising the minimum wage would also be real, and it would help lift many families out of poverty. Closing tax loopholes and making the Tax Code fairer would be real. Instead, today, we are voting on two senses of Congress resolutions. Doing so provides further evidence that the Republicans not only are not acting on those real problems mentioned earlier but are in denial on another real issue that needs action--climate change. The scientific evidence of climate change is overwhelming, and the consensus is clear, and we have seen the impacts of climate change, virtually, every day in our country and around the world. This week, the CBO, led by a Director appointed by the majority here, released a report that identified the effects of climate change as a potential risk to the Federal budget. According to that report, the cost of hurricane damage is projected to be $35 billion more than it is today because of climate change. The report stated: ``Human activities around the world, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and widespread changes in land use, are producing growing emissions of greenhouse gases.'' Climate change requires all of us, including the Republicans here who are in total denial, to come to our senses and to act on the challenge of climate change. This sense of Congress resolution, like the second one, completely fails to meet that challenge. I urge its rejection. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) control the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), a member of the Ways and Means Committee and the chairman of the Tax Policy Subcommittee. Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my colleague and friend on the Ways and Means Committee, Mrs. Black, for yielding time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 89, a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy. At a time when 80 percent of domestic energy consumption comes from natural gas, from oil, from coal, it is, clearly, counterproductive to make these necessary resources more expensive by imposing an indirect tax on these fuels. A carbon tax means higher utility bills for families, more expensive goods and services for consumers, decreased economic activity, and it would really hurt job creation. We already heard about the dismal numbers last week that were released--38,000 non-farm-related jobs. Let me just be clear. When we were in the recession, one of the prime drivers economically that took us out of the recession was the shale revolution--a real energy renaissance in this country. Mr. Speaker, this type of tax is not just a tax on carbon--it is a tax on working families; it is a tax on the American economy; it is a tax on American competitiveness; it is a tax on our energy security. It strikes right at the foundation of our national security. It is the wrong thing to do. It is a regressive tax. It hurts the people who are most dependent on fixed incomes--seniors. It hurts them most. Why would we even consider doing this? There are better ways to set up taxation for this country that meet our needs. I just don't understand why one would propose this type of tax, other than the fact that there is a radical environmental agenda, which would hurt manufacturing and American competitiveness. We can't do this. We need to grow this economy. We need growth around 3 to 4 percent minimum to create jobs, to let American business create value, to assert American leadership globally. We are not going to do this with a carbon tax. We won't do it. We need pro-growth policies. Mr. Speaker, the American people understand this. A recent study by the Institute for Energy Policy found that over 60 percent of Americans oppose this type of idea. I applaud Whip Scalise for offering this sensible resolution because it then puts forth a very strong, affirmative statement that we are not going to disarm the American economy, that we are not going to strike a blow at American competitiveness when we are struggling already as it is. I am sick and tired of the fact that American leadership is eroding around the world. I am sick and tired of the fact that we are walking around with timidity. We ought to be embracing the concept of American leadership. This gives us an opportunity, based on American innovation and energy--the clearest example of which I know of American exceptionalism--to rewrite the rules of energy security based on open markets, transparent pricing, and diversity of supply source. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to hear my friend from Louisiana with his impassioned presentation today; but his presentation, coming on the heels of what we all heard from the Prime Minister of India--calling for a low carbon, sustainable, innovative future--makes me sad. If we would have had our economy take these issues seriously--maybe have a week of hearings--we would have been able to demonstrate to the gentleman with an impartial panel of independent experts all across the political spectrum--Conservative, Liberal, Republican, and Democrat-- that a carbon tax, revenue neutral, is, actually, the key to the innovative future they want. There are all sorts of ways to design a carbon tax, to, actually, enhance the role--the economic status--of low- and moderate-income people, but we never had a hearing on that. It is just simply dismissed as something that we can't do, but they have done it elsewhere in the world. If the committee had done its job, we would be dealing with facts, not hyperbole. {time} 0930 If the committee had done its job, we would have heard that we have very real challenges today to American security, which our Department of Defense has pointed out. Climate change, despite denial from some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, is a threat today to the American military posture. Climate change is disrupting industries like fishing. It is producing unprecedented flooding, forest fires, and a wildly unpredictable weather future. The reduction of arctic ice at unprecedented levels ought to be of concern to my friends on the other side of the aisle. Maybe if we had some open, honest hearings that were balanced and independent, that case would have been made and they may support it. But whether or not they care about climate change and global warming, a carbon tax makes sense for American innovation, the economy, and our competitiveness. It is the areas of low-carbon energy that have seen the job growth. There are now more people [[Page H3671]] working in wind and solar than the coal industry by far. That is where the job growth has been undertaken. A carbon tax would enhance America's global competitiveness. And if we had hearings, listening to independent experts across the board, that case would be made, and I don't think we would have this foolish resolution on the floor. These are elements that would inject into our energy policy an even, balanced approach using market forces, which are much easier than some of the incentives that we have, which are important, which people on both sides of the aisle have supported in the past. But a carbon tax is a more effective way of achieving those objectives. Now, Mr. Speaker, I am sad that we didn't have that debate in committee. I am sad that we didn't hear from independent experts. I think of our friend Bob Inglis, former Congressperson, who is on a personal crusade working with the evangelical community about the merits of a carbon tax. It would have been great to have heard from Bob and others like him to be able to present a balanced picture and be able to deal with meaningful policy. I still hope that someday, that time will come that our Ways and Means Committee actually takes the time to dive into one of the most important issues of the day and to examine one of the tools that independent experts all across the spectrum agree would be a solid addition and actually simplify the Tax Code while we can help people in low income and small business and provide incentives for America's global competitiveness, like we heard from the Prime Minister of India from that very rostrum just 2 days ago. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a colleague of mine and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black). We see eye to eye on almost everything in our lives, and it is really good to be able to stand here today and speak so strongly in favor of H. Con. Res. 89. I really do appreciate the passion and sincerity of my colleagues across the aisle. What we are talking today is about policy. What we are talking about today is the all-important, unintended consequences that so often are put to blame for bad things that happen to American people. They are well intended, yes, at their conception, but very harmful. We are talking about a carbon tax, $10 a barrel on oil. And we are saying: Well, don't worry about that because that is going to be charged upstream. That is going to be charged when it is taken out of the ground. But we all know that every single tax, every single cost is paid downstream. What do I mean by that? Every day hardworking Americans get up in the morning and want to put a roof over the heads of their families, food on the table, clothes on their back, and a little bit of money put away for their future. But every day we continue to come up with policies that somehow, although well intended, make it harder for them to make a living, make it harder for them to live the American Dream, make it harder for them to get ready for the future. Now, I know there are always going to be existential threats. I get that. My grandson is afraid to get out of bed at night because he thinks there is a monster under it. He thinks that if you get up in the middle of the night, maybe there is somebody in the closet or maybe there is something else. Now, I am not a climate change denier. Of course, the climate changes. I have seen it happen in my life. I have seen it where people say it is getting too cold and now it is getting too warm. Well, you know what? It just changes. I get that. What doesn't change is the assault on the American people to pick up the tab on all of these costs. There is nothing that makes less sense to me than what we are doing. And back home where I come from, there is an old saying that goes something like this: Measure twice and cut once. Why? Because once you do that cut, it is permanent. That is why you want to measure twice to make sure that the cut you make is the right cut. That is why you need to take the policies that affect everyday American people and make sure that you are not hurting them. Well intended, I get it. I know it is well intended. I just don't think the American people have to pay the brunt of this. I am very aware of the Prime Minister of India being here Wednesday. And I also know that between India and China, that is where the greatest pollution comes from. I get it. I get it. Putting $10 a barrel on oil coming out of the ground just doesn't make sense. I would just like my friends on both sides of the aisle to think about somebody named Steven Jobs. Steven Jobs did not invent the PC because we taxed typewriters too high and caused the cost of that. Innovation, of course, is the answer. And we have seen great innovation. I know where I am from in western Pennsylvania, that clean coal is real. But the President promised, when he was running as a candidate, that he would put those who chose to make electricity by burning coal out of business. So we regulate them to the point where it is no longer cost efficient to do that, but we keep moving that way. The fact that 40,000 Pennsylvanians make a living that way, well, don't worry about that, they will have to find something else to do. You can go down to West Virginia and you can hear where candidates told them: Listen, you are going to be out of business, but we will find something else for you to do and we will just get to that later. Look, we have an opportunity today. This is a sense of Congress to tell the American people what it is that we think goes on with this policy. For far too long we have turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to the people who sent us here to represent them. We talk very loftily about what it is that we would like to see, how it is that we would like it to go, our dream for the future. But we forget that every day, hardworking American taxpayers get up, throw their feet out over the side of the bed, and go to work for a very particular reason: their families, their churches, their schools, their communities and, more importantly, all of America. Well intended, yes. But the results would be devastating. And who would pay this carbon tax? Who would pay this $10 a barrel? It would be any man or woman who has to go out and buy anything for his or her family. It would be reflected in the cost of everything we put on our backs and everything we put in our mouths. It would affect everything we do when we travel from one point to another, but we say it is necessary. It is necessary because we have to tax this so high that we drive people away from it. I would hope that we could come together in America's House and do what is right for America's people, to do what is right for the people who sent us here to represent them because they are working so hard to make sure that there is a future for their children. In the last month when we created one job for every 8,000 Americans-- one job for every 8,000 Americans, are you kidding me?--in the greatest country the world has ever known, in a Nation that leads the world in defending freedom and liberty, in a Nation that knows that the best way to help others is through American participation---- The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I do want to make sure that this final point comes across: We can work together for solutions. We can work together to do the same things for the same people that we all came here to represent. I do not think that there are ill-intended ideas on the other side. I think they are well-intended. I just think they are wrong. I think they are wrong for the times, and I think they are wrong for the American people. As I said earlier, where I am from, there are a lot of old adages. And one of them is: don't worry about the mule, just load the wagon. I will tell you right now that the mule is trying to find a way to unhook [[Page H3672]] itself from the wagon because that load has gotten too heavy to pay. I know that the people who are loading the wagon think it is okay because at some point, that is going to have to be delivered somewhere. The truth of the matter is it is not. We have put too heavy a burden on American taxpayers, hardworking American taxpayers, hardworking Americans. 1.4 million American lives have been sacrificed for the freedom and liberty not just of this country--our country and our Nation--but for the whole world. So I say let's be careful before we do these well-intended but careless things. Let's be careful before we turn our backs on the people who we actually represent here, and that is hardworking American people. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I couldn't agree more with my good friend from Butler, Pennsylvania, that we can actually come together and fashion solutions. That is why it is such a tragedy that this resolution comes to the floor without ever having our committee work on it, because we could have had hearings that could have narrowed those gaps. I include in the Record a letter from six conservative advocates for climate change action. June 7, 2016. Dear Representative: Later this week Congress will take up a resolution sponsored by Congressman Scalise (R-LA1) that expresses the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the economy of the United States. We are concerned that this resolution offers a limited perspective on carbon taxes and is blind to the potential benefits of market-based climate policy. Legislation that incorporates a carbon tax could include regulatory and tax reforms to make the United States economy more competitive, innovative, and robust, benefiting both present and future generations. We recognize that a carbon tax, like any tax, will impose economic costs. But climate change is also imposing economic costs. This resolution falls short by recognizing the cost of action without considering the cost of staying on our present policy course. There are, of course, uncertainties about the future cost of climate change and, likewise, the cost associated with a carbon tax (much would depend on program design and the pace and nature of technological progress). The need for action, however, is clear. A recent survey of economists who publish in leading peer-reviewed journals on these matters found that 93% believe that a meaningful policy response to climate change is warranted. The least burdensome, most straightforward, and most market-friendly means of addressing climate change is to price the risks imposed by greenhouse gas emissions via a tax. This would harness price signals, rather than regulations, to guide market response. That is why carbon pricing has the support of free market economists, a majority of the global business community, and a large number of the largest multinational private oil and gas companies in the world (the corporate entities among the most directly affected by climate policy). In reaching a conclusion, this resolution neglects the fact that the United States already has a multiplicity of carbon taxes. They are imposed, however, via dozens of federal and state regulations, are invisible to consumers, unevenly imposed across industrial sectors, unnecessarily costly, and growing in size and scope. The policy choice is not if we should price carbon emissions, but how. Unfortunately, this resolution also fails to differentiate between proposals that would impose carbon taxes on top of existing regulations (chiefly the Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan), and proposals that would impose carbon taxes in place of those existing regulations. Conservatives and free market advocates should embrace the latter, regardless of how they view climate risks. An economy-wide carbon tax that replaces existing regulatory interventions could reduce the cost of climate policy and deregulate the economy. It could also provide revenue to support pro-growth tax reform, including corporate income or payroll tax cuts, which could dramatically reduce overall costs on the economy. Revenues could be applied to compensate those who suffer the most from higher energy costs; the poor, the elderly, and individuals and families living on fixed incomes. Unfortunately, none of those options are presently available because Members of Congress have neglected opportunities to design and debate market-friendly climate policies in legislation. Instead, they have yielded authority in climate policy design to the Executive Branch. By discouraging a long-overdue discussion about sensible carbon pricing, this resolution frustrates the development of better policy. Sincerely, Jerry Taylor, President, Niskanen Center. Bob Inglis, Executive Director, RepublicEn. Aparna Mathur, Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute. Eli Lehrer, President, R Street Institute. The Rev. Mitchell C. Hescox, President, Evangelical Environmental Network. Alan Viard, Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, my friend from Pennsylvania could have heard them talk about the need for action and how you can design a carbon tax that meets the objectives he is talking about, but we never did that. We didn't listen to experts across the spectrum--Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, economists, and scientists--to be able to examine the facts. Instead, we have a cartoon proposal that they are arguing against as opposed to something that we could have worked on together that is promoted by most of the independent experts in the field. And someday within our lifetime this Congress will consider and, I think, probably approve. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Seattle, Washington (Mr. McDermott), who has looked at some of these challenges around the globe. Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, as I come to speak on the floor, I think I am in the House of the deniers. Now, in 2007, that liberal journal, National Geographic, had an article called ``The Big Thaw.'' And it says: ``It's no surprise that a warming climate is melting the world's glaciers and polar ice. But no one expected it to happen this fast.'' That was in 2007. That was 9 years ago. I was taken, along with Gerry Connolly, up to the Arctic with the Norweigian Government. They are worried about what is happening. This resolution is just burying your head in the sand. I think you are thinking that if you put your head in the sand long enough, it will go away and, when you pull your head out, it won't be there. The CBO just put a report out: Texas, Louisiana, and Florida are going to have hurricane damage that is unbelievable. FEMA already accounts for 45 percent of money spent on hurricane damage, $95 billion since 2000. Now, if you think the insurance companies are going to keep insuring against hurricanes, you have another thing coming. At some point, they are going to say: We are not doing hurricane insurance in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and a whole bunch of other places. That is the economics. You say: Let's not pay anything right now, let's not change anything, let's not work on it. But if we don't work on it, we are going to pay later. I am old enough to remember a FRAM commercial on the television. It was an air cleaner on your car, and it said: Pay me now or pay me later. And this is what this is about today. Now, there are things going on in this country which just absolutely boggle my mind. In North Carolina, the assembly got together and they said: You know what? We are not going to spend any money to measure the sea levels. Now, you have hundreds of miles of coastline in North Carolina where the sea is rising and property values are going to be lost. We are talking money here. We are not talking soft, liberal stuff. This is real, and people don't want to even look at it. In Florida and Wisconsin, they took a novel approach and they said: We are not even going to use the words ``climate change'' in anything. Now, here in Congress, the climate deniers take many forms, from blocking the words ``social cost of carbon'' to directing the Department of Defense to ignore climate change. All the while, the DOD itself highlights the threat of climate change to national security. Republicans like to talk about national security. {time} 0945 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. McDERMOTT. If you are serious about talking about national security, [[Page H3673]] you better start talking about the climate change that is going on in the world. Sea lanes across the North Pole are coming, boats are already coming, we are building the Panama Canal wider, and it is opening up on the north end of the globe. Now, this absurdity cannot last, and we have got to begin to do what Mr. Blumenauer suggested. There have to be hearings. Bob Inglis, I knew him when he was here. God, he was a wild-eyed liberal. I couldn't believe what a wild-eyed liberal he was. He came down here talking about a carbon tax. I had a carbon tax. Mr. Larson had a carbon tax. This is not a partisan issue, Democrat versus Republican; it is whether or not you are going to look at the science of what is happening on the globe. I urge people to vote ``no'' on this. You will come back and do it in a couple of years. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our majority whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for yielding. I am proud to bring forward this legislation, Mr. Speaker, that expresses the strong sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy. If you look at what this administration has done through radical rules and regulations, through all of its agencies, starting with the EPA, with the IRS, with the NLRB, the whole alphabet soup of Federal agencies that every morning wake up trying to figure out how to make it harder for our economy to get moving again, how to make it harder for people to create jobs in America, frankly, the results of these radical regulations are shifting and running jobs away, out of our country to foreign countries like China, like India, and they want to keep it going. This is not a new concept, Mr. Speaker. They tried this years ago when they brought through the cap-and-trade bill. Passed out of the House, it couldn't even pass in the Senate when they had a supermajority in the Senate with 60 votes because it was such a detrimental idea that would devastate our economy. Yet even with that defeat, President Obama still tries to come back with a carbon tax through other means, whether it is regulations or whether it is superimposed carbon taxes through the EPA and some of the other things they are doing. We have had hearings on this, Mr. Speaker. There is data all around that confirms how devastating a carbon tax would be to the United States economy. You can just look at what some of the outside groups that look at this said. The National Association of Manufacturers, the people that make things in America, have confirmed we would lose more than a million jobs in America if a carbon tax was imposed. Where would those jobs go? They would go to countries, ironically, that don't have the good environmental standards we already have. So they would go to countries like China and India where, if you are concerned about carbon going into the atmosphere, the things that they do to produce the same things we produce here in America, it creates more than five times the amount of carbon in those countries. So you are shifting jobs out of America to send it to countries where you would actually create more carbon. They talk about somehow being able to create policy that will stop hurricanes and change the sea level rising, for goodness sake, as if some policy is going to do that. By the way, the result of their policies will increase carbon in the Earth's atmosphere. But let's not even talk about that. Let's actually talk about the track record of this administration that now wants to control the Earth's temperature. They spent over $500 million and couldn't even create a Web site to take your health insurance requests, healthcare.gov. Remember that? Well, this same group now thinks they can control the Earth's temperature through radical policies. Again, let's look at the devastating impact these policies would have. They wouldn't work, first of all, but they would have a devastating impact on the middle class of this country. The Congressional Budget Office, our own Congressional Budget Office that looked at this, said a carbon tax would actually hit low-income people the hardest, even harder than high-income people. It would have a devastating impact on those people who are least able to afford it because it would increase the cost of everything they do. It would increase your food costs at the grocery store. It would increase, of course, what you pay at the pump. It would increase your electricity prices. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman. Mr. SCALISE. The Heritage Foundation looked at this and said that this kind of carbon tax would actually increase the cost of everything that families buy by over $1,400 per family. Families are going to pay $1,400 more every year for the cost of a carbon tax that the other side wants to defend. And to yield what? To just yield an opportunity for countries like China and India to grow their economies at the expense of ours. So, Mr. Speaker, if you look at what they are trying to do--and, again, if you want to do this, bring it forward as an idea in legislation. They tried it with cap-and-trade, and it got defeated when Democrats controlled everything. There is bipartisanship on this issue, and the bipartisanship is in opposition to a carbon tax. So why don't we go on record and be very clear about it, not just that it is bad policy, but also to reaffirm how devastating it would be for the United States economy. It shouldn't move forward. The President needs to stop this radical agenda and instead focus on reversing the depressing economic activity that we have seen in this country since he has been President because of these kinds of policies. Let's get real economic growth. Let's bring those jobs back to the United States. Let's reject a carbon tax. I urge adoption of this resolution. Mr. BLUMENAUER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed my friend from Louisiana's impassioned presentation. It is too bad that the Committee on Ways and Means didn't actually sit down and go through the elements that would be in a balanced carbon tax. He is debating a cartoon version, not one that we worked on. I am going to yield, in a moment, to one of the gentlemen who, earlier in this carbon debate several Congresses ago, has been involved with crafting a realistic carbon tax. We had the reference to the inability to move the cap-and-trade, which I don't think is as good as a carbon tax. It failed because there were a minority of the Senate who were opposed to allowing it to go forward. It wasn't that we didn't have a majority that were interested. In the Senate, you can have a veto with 41 people who are decided that they are not going to allow things to move forward. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson). He has been a student of a carbon tax, who has listened to those people across the political spectrum and has been a champion of a reasonable, thoughtful approach to promote American innovation. I would just point out the areas where we have had the greatest job growth in the energy sector have not been petroleum or coal. It has been solar and wind. A carbon tax would help accelerate that by leveling the playing field and allowing the forces of economics to dictate the next steps. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be on the floor and join in this debate. I must, along with my colleague from Oregon, express frustration. This body should be about the vitality of ideas. Whatever those ideas are, in a democracy, there ought to be the willingness to express them. Mr. Blumenauer has detailed, at length, the lack of public hearings. Listen, I get it. This is a messaging opportunity. This has no force of law. All this does is say what the sensibilities are of the Congress. Now, what does the public think of the sensibilities of the Congress? What the public thinks is that we are all bluster and no solution and that we never take the time to sit down and measure twice and then cut. We just simply don't do that in our committees. [[Page H3674]] And so the vitality of ideas, a very noble idea expressed by a Republican, Mr. Inglis, many sessions ago and embraced by many conservative economists in the Reagan, in the Nixon, and in the Bush administrations about providing certainty in terms of what we need to do and a revenue stream that has this at its core: tax pollution--tax pollution--at its source, and pass the savings on to the consumers. We know the volumes that are produced. We know the science behind this. There should be an open and clear-eyed debate on this; but not only a debate about the pros and cons, but how about something refreshing for the American people--a solution. It may not be the bill that I proposed or that Bob Inglis proposed or that any number of people have embraced, but you have major companies, including major oil companies that will be taxed, say, no, this is a sensible way for us to embrace this, and we are enjoined by the very people who this would tax and by conservative economists who say, yeah, we ought to take a look at this not only from the standpoint of the certainty that it will provide, but the known certainty of what pollution does. And it is not just about climate change. It is about the health of the air that we breathe, what we are poisoning in the atmosphere for our children, what happens with respect to the effects of asthma and what happens in terms of the people in coal mines from black lung disease. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. These debilitating diseases scream out for the Congress not to have a message opportunity that may or may not advantage one side or the other in the realm of politics, but how about a solution? How about us doing what Mike Kelly suggested, to work together in the committee to come up with a positive solution as to how to address this? Pass the savings along to the consumer. Develop a revenue system that will, in fact, allow us to rebuild our country that is crumbling around us. Let's take those steps and the responsibility that we all have to the citizens to provide them with solutions, not bluster. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa), a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Committee on Natural Resources. Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Black and Mr. Boustany on these two concurrent resolutions that are being offered today. I appreciate the time. I recall in this debate here that there was a whole movie back in the 1960s called ``If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium.'' Well, if it is tax-raising time, this must be Washington, D.C., because there are more schemes all the time to come hit not just big, evil corporations and big energy producers; this always ends up hitting the bottom line of American working families and the economy. The President's plan to raise a tax on each and every barrel of oil produced by $10 translates out to 25 cents at the pump. We heard earlier some of my colleagues talk about what the carbon tax would mean to working families--much more than they can afford in this bad economy and a time where the jobless rate is higher than is even measurable by this administration. This continues the antidomestically produced energy narrative of this administration. It only hurts U.S. energy jobs and takes productive U.S. fields, such as what we have in California, out of production that are on the margins of being profitable. Instead of having domestically produced energy, we are going to shift more of that burden to other sources: foreign energy or the need for exploring more here or offshore. Why don't we allow the profitable energy and oilfields we have in California and this country to continue to be productive and not hamper them with another additional tax that will take them out of production and rely more on foreign oil? Now, how popular is this amongst regular people? In my own district, we conducted a survey recently where people actually took time to send postcards back into my office that came in at approximately a 90 percent rate in opposition to this $10-per-barrel oil tax, which they understand means 25 cents, again, per gallon at the gas pump. This really, really hurts all Americans. It hurts working families, people on the lower end of the income scale, but even more so, districts like mine that are very rural and all the other rural districts around this country where people have to travel farther to get to their work, to take their kids to school or to healthcare appointments, their ball games, maybe even save up occasionally in this economy for a travel vacation they might like to take and visit the beauty of America. {time} 1000 So the rural economy is even more devastated by this--the rural economy that also would be productive with energy--with these schemes that are being pondered. Additionally, there are other ideas, like a tax on every mile driven, which is being contemplated at some level here federally as well as in my own State. Tax people for every mile they drive, tax them at the gas pump, tax them for carbon. Again, this hits real people in America, not just some idea of a big, evil corporation. The answer in Washington always seems to be more government and taxation that hurts working families. Perhaps first, these dollars should be channeled into projects that people can use. Not more environmental projects, but more highways, more bridges, more water storage. Not boondoggles like we have in California, such as the high- speed rail money pit, or the cost of frivolous environmental measures that drive up the costs of construction projects and sometimes even completely eliminate them. We talk about a green economy a lot, especially on that side of the floor over there. Why don't we focus on a green economy that is not based on importing solar panels from China or wind machines from Europe? How about we get out and do the forestry that is needed to be done to thin the forests? We are talking about the air we breathe. Each summer, for months, the air is brown in northern California--lots of California--and lots of the Western States from forests that are burning because they are not managed, because they are not thinned. Instead, they are overgrown. That would be a green economy. We could turn this into biomass if you want to have real energy that works for the equation of renewable energy. Channel that effort into that instead of chasing these wind machines and solar panels. Mr. Speaker, this is why I support H. Con. Res. 112 and H. Con. Res. 89, to send a message that this is more job-killing taxes and schemes that will fix our economy. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. LaMALFA. It is the freedom to explore for and produce low-cost domestic energy that will help Americans and our economy to recover once again. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney), a gentleman who brings his private sector business success to commonsense solutions in policy. Mr. DELANEY. I want to thank my friend from Oregon for yielding. Mr. Speaker, today, my friends on the other side of the aisle are making four points. The first point they are making is that they don't believe in science, because the science around climate change is unassailable. The second point they are making is that they don't worry about American prosperity, because from an economic perspective and national security, the military, we should be reminded, has called climate change a threat multiplier. This is a very significant risk to long- term American prosperity. The third point they are making is that they don't believe in the power of markets to change behavior at its core. They are not acknowledging the power of a capitalistic economic model to change people's behavior. And the fourth thing they are saying is that they don't trust U.S. businesses to innovate into opportunities and around challenges. [[Page H3675]] These are extraordinary statements. And contrast that with our approach. I have a piece of legislation called the Tax Pollution, Not Profits Act, which puts in place a carbon pricing mechanism, which has been proven to be the most effective way--more effective than a regulatory approach--to change behavior and reverse some of the trends and bend the curve on climate change. We take the revenues that are generated by that bill and we use it to offset all of the costs that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say exist through tax credits to individuals. We set aside money to take care of the retirement of all the coal workers in the United States of America for the rest of their lives, and then we take the remaining revenues and we pay for a significant and substantial cut to business taxes. So this piece of legislation, unlike what my colleagues are proposing, has a double bottom line. It will reverse the negative effects of climate change and the threat to our prosperity, and it is a pro-growth policy because it puts money back in the economy and it makes a bet on U.S. businesses that they can innovate and grow into opportunities and around challenges. It is reflective of the view of businesses in 2016, not the view of businesses from the 1950s. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 9\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 9 minutes remaining. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman), my friend, who has spent a lot of time thinking about these environmental issues and acting on them. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to these two resolutions. The first one, H. Con. Res. 89, says that a carbon tax would necessarily be detrimental to the United States economy. This is false. Plain and simple. The truth is that we can and we must design carbon pollution reduction strategies to spur advancements in clean energy technology, reduce carbon pollution, and fight climate change. These strategies, including a carbon tax or a fee, can easily be designed to be revenue-neutral, and we know from long experience at the State and Federal level that fighting pollution is good for jobs and good for the economy. California is a perfect example. If anyone has questions about this, come to California, where you will see that climate leadership is actually also good economics. It doesn't seem to matter to my colleagues who have offered these resolutions. In the year 2016, they continue to deny the reality of climate change. Literally, our friends across the aisle are the last policymakers on the planet Earth to hold this view. Even in other oil- producing companies, the conservative parties in those countries acknowledge climate change, and they have positions in their party platforms that acknowledge we need to do something about it. Now, the other resolution, H. Con. Res. 112, similarly demonstrates a lack of leadership by opposing President Obama's proposal to finance infrastructure investments. Those who don't support the President's infrastructure financing mechanism, I think, have a responsibility to offer their own solutions for our infrastructure crisis. This bill doesn't do that. Instead, it simply describes a desire to support Big Oil. So here we have it: climate denial; the party that doesn't want to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court; a party that doesn't want to do its job to respond to public health crises, like Zika; a party that prefers not to offer any solutions on our critical infrastructure funding needs. Is this how we are going to make America great again? I don't think so. Let's move forward in the 21st century and not let our energy and infrastructure policies be driven by 18th century thinking. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose both of these bills. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright). Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, we are here debating H. Con. Res. 89, which purports to express the sense of Congress. But really, nothing could be further from the truth, because what it does is express the nonsense of Congress. We are here witnessing the latest example of climate denial brought to the floor by the majority. The entire world agrees that climate change is a pressing problem, except this extreme wing of the Republican Party. Climate change is already affecting people across the globe. As Dr. McDermott from Washington pointed out already, the nonpartisan CBO recently noted the increasing and enormous budgetary impact future storms will have on our Nation, and attributed the majority of this problem to climate change. And I am here to tell you these costs will fall disproportionately on low-income people, low-income communities, and people of color in our country. Are we here on the floor debating a real solution brought forward by the majority? Are we here having hearings? No, we are not. We are here debating a resolution cutting off a solution that economists from all corners of the Earth believe is the most efficient way to address climate change. A properly designed price on carbon can improve the overall performance of the U.S. economy, protect competitiveness, create jobs, promote investment, and lead us toward American energy independence. The gentleman from Oregon is right: instead of debating this resolution, we should be having hearings discussing ways that we can sensibly lead the transition to renewable fuels and clean energy sources. Even big oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell and BP have voiced support for carbon taxes in recent years, acknowledging that climate change is real and that we should be doing something about it. And I say, Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on H. Con. Res. 89, and let's start a real debate, a sensible debate on this existential threat to our Nation and to the globe. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I really appreciate this little window of an opportunity to talk about a carbon tax. I hope that the day will come when we will have an opportunity to have that discussion in a robust and thoughtful way in our Ways and Means Committee. Heaven knows it is important. Lots of people have opinions and ideas. I think we would benefit from it, but I hope that we will have that discussion after we hear from a balanced, wide-ranging group of independent experts across the spectrum to be able to give us meaningful information about it. I include in the Record a letter from Greg Dotson, who is the Vice President for Energy Policy at the Center for American Progress. Center for American Progress, Washington, DC, June 8, 2016. Dear Representative: Later this week, the U.S. House of Representatives will consider H. Con. Res. 89, a resolution that rejects the pricing of carbon pollution. On behalf of the Center for American Progress, I am writing to urge you to oppose this resolution. It is time for Congress to develop sensible policies that address the serious and potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change. Science informs us that we need an urgent solution to this problem. Although the current Administration has made historic progress on climate change, it is clear that we need to do more to achieve additional carbon pollution reductions and lead the world in responding to this global challenge. Top economic advisors to both Democratic and Republican Presidents have expressed their support for putting a price on carbon as an effective and efficient approach for reducing pollution. Joseph Stiglitz, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) under President Bill Clinton, has stated, ``Economic efficiency requires that those who generate emissions pay the cost, and the simplest way of forcing them to do so is through a carbon tax.'' Gregory Mankiw, former Chairman of the CEA under President George W. Bush, has stated, ``Basic economics tells us that when you tax something, you normally get less of it. So if we want to reduce global emissions of carbon, we need a global carbon tax.'' In fact, carbon pollution is already priced in a significant portion of the world. In total, about 40 national jurisdictions and more than 20 cities, states, and regions on [[Page H3676]] five continents--representing almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions--have placed a price on carbon. In the United States, 25 percent of the population lives in a jurisdiction where carbon pollution is currently priced and where one-third of the country's economic activity takes place. The price on carbon in California is the highest of any state in the country at almost $13 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, and yet the California economy is projected to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the United States over the next two years. In recent years, momentum to expand the adoption of carbon pricing policies has been growing. More than 400 investors with more than $24 trillion in assets have called on governments to establish ``stable, economically meaningful carbon pricing.'' Already, more than 1,000 businesses apply a price on carbon to inform their investments and operations or plan to do so in the next two years. In addition, at the United Nations climate talks in Paris last December, governments, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations announced the new Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition to accelerate and expand the adoption of carbon pricing worldwide. In order to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, the United States needs to consider all possible tools at its disposal, including the effective market-based mechanisms of carbon pricing. Members of Congress need to work together on a bipartisan basis to find ways to cut carbon pollution rather than advance polarizing measures that take useful tools off the table. I urge you to reject this ill-advised resolution. Sincerely, Greg Dotson, Vice President for Energy Policy, Center for American Progress. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Let me just read a couple of items from Mr. Dotson's letter. He points out that ``top economic advisors to both Democratic and Republican Presidents have expressed their support for putting a price on carbon as an effective and efficient approach for reducing pollution.'' He cites Gregory Mankiw, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, who says: ``Basic economics tells us that when you tax something, you normally get less of it. So if we want to reduce global emissions of carbon, we need a global carbon tax.'' ``In fact, carbon pollution is already priced in a significant portion of the world. In total, about 40 national jurisdictions and more than 20 cities, states, and regions on five continents-- representing almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions--have placed a price on carbon. In the United States, 25 percent of the population lives in jurisdictions where carbon pollution is currently priced and where one-third of the country's economic activity takes place.'' That is in America right now. There is no acknowledgment of that in this debate. We could have talked about that in the committee. ``The price on carbon in California,'' referenced by my friend, Mr. Huffman, ``is the highest of any state in the country at almost $13 per ton . . . yet the California economy is projected to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the United States over the next two years.'' They reference the fact that ``more than 400 investors with more than $24 trillion in assets have called on governments to establish `stable, economically meaningful carbon pricing.' Already, more than 1,000 businesses apply a price on carbon to inform their investments and operations or plan to do so in the next two years. In addition, at the United Nations climate talks in Paris last December, governments, business, nongovernmental organizations announced the new Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition to accelerate and expand the adoption of carbon pricing worldwide,'' in keeping with what we heard from Prime Minister Modi in this Chamber just 2 days ago. {time} 1015 Yet my friends on the other side of the aisle are not involved with our being able to discuss this in depth, being able to bring in the experts, being able to work together to design a pricing mechanism that avoids some of the cartoon characteristics that they establish here. We had that chance, and we haven't done it. But this will not be the last word. This meaningless resolution will undoubtedly pass today. It is not going to have any impact in terms of the long term. The long term, we are on a path to price carbon, and we have the capacity to do so in a thoughtful and an effective way, like the conservative leaders, whose correspondence I put into the Record earlier, suggest. It can be revenue neutral. It can be effective. It can help reverse the more damaging effects of climate change, and it is a way to promote economic opportunity and global competitiveness. I appreciate the opportunity to express my views on this. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. You know, although my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made this a conversation about climate change--which I agree that we can have and we should have in another venue, and that is in the committee structure--this is about a President who decided on his own, without coming to Congress to discuss this tax, this $10 tax on a barrel of gasoline, because he was unable to get this carbon tax, when, by the way, the House and the Senate were both in his own party, he couldn't even get this passed. So this is a discussion for another day about climate change, which we can all have, and have in a very gentle way. However, let me sum up what this would do if this were to pass, the impact that this carbon tax would have on the American people: It would drive up the cost of energy, which would most affect those at the lower income. It would destroy well-paying jobs in the energy industry, well-paying jobs. Right now, when we look at what our loss of jobs are here in this country, we have the lowest rate of jobs in 6 years. Number three, it would directly hit working families the most, those at the very lowest income, and especially those who are elderly. None of these help to grow our economy and get our economy moving or people back to work or raise their incomes. Therefore, I urge a ``yes'' vote on H. Con. Res. 89. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I include the following letter from opponents of H. Con. Res. 89: June 7, 2016. Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members and supporters, the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose H. Con. Res. 89. This resolution is the latest example of climate action denial being advanced by extreme members of the House of Representatives. Instead of listening to the national security experts, faith leaders, scientists, energy innovators, health professionals and many others who are sounding the alarm on climate change and have implored our nation's elected officials to support action, Rep. Scalise and the co-sponsors of H. Con. Res. 89 appear to be looking for another way to say ``no.'' The sponsors of the resolution have no plan to address climate change and have opposed every proposal to do something about the planet's gravest environmental problem. Many of them don't even accept the scientific fact that climate change is occurring. H. Con. Res. 89 ignores the huge costs that our country is already experiencing due to climate change--costs that fall disproportionately on low-income communities and communities of color. It is clear this resolution is meant to put the interests of the polluting fossil fuel companies ahead of the American public's best interest. Instead of holding another just-for-show vote against climate action, the U.S. House of Representatives should be debating how it can best position our country to lead the global transition to clean energy sources. Last year more than half of the world's new energy came from renewable energy sources and the landmark Paris climate agreement sends a powerful signal to investors that this trend toward low- carbon energy will accelerate. More and more countries and hundreds of forward-looking companies are adopting policies to limit carbon pollution and correct the markets failure to capture the health and environmental costs of burning fossil fuels. At a time when the American taxpayer is already paying to move vulnerable American communities to higher ground because of climate-driven sea level rise, we have no time to waste on empty resolutions that seek to take potential climate solutions off the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the concurrent resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. [[Page H3677]] Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_182.csv,64833,64833,64899,"[congressional record volume 162, number 92 (friday, june 10, 2016)] [house] [pages h3669-h3677] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] expressing the sense of congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the united states economy mrs. black. mr. speaker, pursuant to house resolution 767, i call up the concurrent resolution (h. con. res. 89) expressing the sense of congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the united states economy, and ask for its immediate consideration. the clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 767, the concurrent resolution is considered read. the text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: h. con. res. 89 whereas a carbon tax is a federal tax on carbon released from fossil fuels; whereas a carbon tax will increase energy prices, including the price of gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and home heating oil; whereas a carbon tax will mean that families and consumers will pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and electricity; whereas a carbon tax will fall hardest on the poor, the elderly, and those on fixed incomes; whereas a carbon tax will lead to more jobs and businesses moving overseas; whereas a carbon tax will lead to less economic growth; whereas american families will be harmed the most from a carbon tax; whereas, according to the energy information administration, in 2011, fossil fuels share of energy consumption was 82 percent; whereas a carbon tax will increase the cost of every good manufactured in the united states; whereas a carbon tax will impose disproportionate burdens on certain industries, jobs, states, and geographic regions and would further restrict the global competitiveness of the united states; whereas american ingenuity has led to innovations in energy exploration and development and has increased production of domestic energy resources on private and state-owned land which has created significant job growth and private capital investment; whereas united states energy policy should encourage continued private sector innovation and development and not increase the existing tax burden on manufacturers; whereas the production of american energy resources increases the united states ability to maintain a competitive advantage in today's global economy; whereas a carbon tax would reduce america's global competitiveness and would encourage development abroad in countries that do not impose this exorbitant tax burden; and whereas the congress and the president should focus on pro- growth solutions that encourage increased development of domestic resources: now, therefore, be it resolved by the house of representatives (the senate concurring), that it is the sense of congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to american families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the united states. the speaker pro tempore. the concurrent resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means. the gentlewoman from tennessee (mrs. black) and the gentleman from michigan (mr. levin) each will control 30 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from tennessee. general leave mrs. black. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on h. con. res. 89, currently under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from tennessee? there was no objection. mrs. black. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h. con. res. 89, which takes a strong stand against the carbon tax that would hurt american families, workers, and job creators. as the president closes out his time in office, he would like nothing more than to ram through more of his harmful energy agenda. just look at the president's budget this year. among the $3.4 trillion in tax hikes he proposed, the president included a $10 per barrel tax on oil. this tax alone would cause gas prices to increase by an estimated 25 cents per gallon. with a carbon tax, there would be a tax hike on production, distribution, and the use of not only oil but also of natural gas and any other form of energy that emits carbon. such a tax would have many serious impacts on our economy by making day-to-day life more expensive for families throughout this country. first, a carbon tax could drive up the cost of energy for both the producers and the consumers. this translates to larger energy bills that eat up even more of americans' take-home pay, especially during the hottest and coldest months of the year. second, a carbon tax would destroy well-paying jobs throughout the american energy sector--a sector that has fueled significant job growth throughout the country. third, a carbon tax would deliver a direct hit to working families and have compound effects that would reach all corners of the economy. in fact, a carbon tax would increase the cost of, virtually, every good manufactured or service performed in the united states, including everyday necessities. if a good requires energy to make or transport, which most do, taxes on that energy are, essentially, a tax on that good. as a result, americans would have to pay more for everything-- from milk to clothing to school supplies. finally, to make this bad idea even worse, we know that a carbon tax would hurt those who are living in poverty and those who are on fixed incomes more than anyone else. put simply, a carbon tax would make it harder for us to grow our economy and help working families and small businesses succeed. [[page h3670]] we all want an all-of-the-above energy approach that supports new innovations, not a targeted tax hike on specific industries. thanks to the leadership of whip scalise, congress will pass this bill today and send it to the senate, and we will send a clear message to the people in our districts, as well as to the obama white house, that we do not support this extreme tax. instead, we will continue to pass legislation that grows our economy and that helps more americans get back to work. after all, last week, we received the worst jobs report in almost 6 years. it is more important than ever that we move forward with a bold, pro-growth agenda, not another expensive washington tax. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. levin. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. what is happening today is further evidence that the republicans are simply not doing their job. there is real work to be done. it is simply inexcusable that action has not yet happened to prepare for the zika virus. that would be real action. helping the people of flint get clean drinking water, in my home state, would be something real. there is no budget resolution that has been considered here on the house floor. raising the minimum wage would also be real, and it would help lift many families out of poverty. closing tax loopholes and making the tax code fairer would be real. instead, today, we are voting on two senses of congress resolutions. doing so provides further evidence that the republicans not only are not acting on those real problems mentioned earlier but are in denial on another real issue that needs action--climate change. the scientific evidence of climate change is overwhelming, and the consensus is clear, and we have seen the impacts of climate change, virtually, every day in our country and around the world. this week, the cbo, led by a director appointed by the majority here, released a report that identified the effects of climate change as a potential risk to the federal budget. according to that report, the cost of hurricane damage is projected to be $35 billion more than it is today because of climate change. the report stated: ``human activities around the world, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and widespread changes in land use, are producing growing emissions of greenhouse gases.'' climate change requires all of us, including the republicans here who are in total denial, to come to our senses and to act on the challenge of climate change. this sense of congress resolution, like the second one, completely fails to meet that challenge. i urge its rejection. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that the distinguished gentleman from oregon (mr. blumenauer) control the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from michigan? there was no objection. mrs. black. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana (mr. boustany), a member of the ways and means committee and the chairman of the tax policy subcommittee. mr. boustany. i thank my colleague and friend on the ways and means committee, mrs. black, for yielding time. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h. con. res. 89, a resolution expressing the sense of congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the united states economy. at a time when 80 percent of domestic energy consumption comes from natural gas, from oil, from coal, it is, clearly, counterproductive to make these necessary resources more expensive by imposing an indirect tax on these fuels. a carbon tax means higher utility bills for families, more expensive goods and services for consumers, decreased economic activity, and it would really hurt job creation. we already heard about the dismal numbers last week that were released--38,000 non-farm-related jobs. let me just be clear. when we were in the recession, one of the prime drivers economically that took us out of the recession was the shale revolution--a real energy renaissance in this country. mr. speaker, this type of tax is not just a tax on carbon--it is a tax on working families; it is a tax on the american economy; it is a tax on american competitiveness; it is a tax on our energy security. it strikes right at the foundation of our national security. it is the wrong thing to do. it is a regressive tax. it hurts the people who are most dependent on fixed incomes--seniors. it hurts them most. why would we even consider doing this? there are better ways to set up taxation for this country that meet our needs. i just don't understand why one would propose this type of tax, other than the fact that there is a radical environmental agenda, which would hurt manufacturing and american competitiveness. we can't do this. we need to grow this economy. we need growth around 3 to 4 percent minimum to create jobs, to let american business create value, to assert american leadership globally. we are not going to do this with a carbon tax. we won't do it. we need pro-growth policies. mr. speaker, the american people understand this. a recent study by the institute for energy policy found that over 60 percent of americans oppose this type of idea. i applaud whip scalise for offering this sensible resolution because it then puts forth a very strong, affirmative statement that we are not going to disarm the american economy, that we are not going to strike a blow at american competitiveness when we are struggling already as it is. i am sick and tired of the fact that american leadership is eroding around the world. i am sick and tired of the fact that we are walking around with timidity. we ought to be embracing the concept of american leadership. this gives us an opportunity, based on american innovation and energy--the clearest example of which i know of american exceptionalism--to rewrite the rules of energy security based on open markets, transparent pricing, and diversity of supply source. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i am pleased to hear my friend from louisiana with his impassioned presentation today; but his presentation, coming on the heels of what we all heard from the prime minister of india--calling for a low carbon, sustainable, innovative future--makes me sad. if we would have had our economy take these issues seriously--maybe have a week of hearings--we would have been able to demonstrate to the gentleman with an impartial panel of independent experts all across the political spectrum--conservative, liberal, republican, and democrat-- that a carbon tax, revenue neutral, is, actually, the key to the innovative future they want. there are all sorts of ways to design a carbon tax, to, actually, enhance the role--the economic status--of low- and moderate-income people, but we never had a hearing on that. it is just simply dismissed as something that we can't do, but they have done it elsewhere in the world. if the committee had done its job, we would be dealing with facts, not hyperbole. {time} 0930 if the committee had done its job, we would have heard that we have very real challenges today to american security, which our department of defense has pointed out. climate change, despite denial from some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, is a threat today to the american military posture. climate change is disrupting industries like fishing. it is producing unprecedented flooding, forest fires, and a wildly unpredictable weather future. the reduction of arctic ice at unprecedented levels ought to be of concern to my friends on the other side of the aisle. maybe if we had some open, honest hearings that were balanced and independent, that case would have been made and they may support it. but whether or not they care about climate change and global warming, a carbon tax makes sense for american innovation, the economy, and our competitiveness. it is the areas of low-carbon energy that have seen the job growth. there are now more people [[page h3671]] working in wind and solar than the coal industry by far. that is where the job growth has been undertaken. a carbon tax would enhance america's global competitiveness. and if we had hearings, listening to independent experts across the board, that case would be made, and i don't think we would have this foolish resolution on the floor. these are elements that would inject into our energy policy an even, balanced approach using market forces, which are much easier than some of the incentives that we have, which are important, which people on both sides of the aisle have supported in the past. but a carbon tax is a more effective way of achieving those objectives. now, mr. speaker, i am sad that we didn't have that debate in committee. i am sad that we didn't hear from independent experts. i think of our friend bob inglis, former congressperson, who is on a personal crusade working with the evangelical community about the merits of a carbon tax. it would have been great to have heard from bob and others like him to be able to present a balanced picture and be able to deal with meaningful policy. i still hope that someday, that time will come that our ways and means committee actually takes the time to dive into one of the most important issues of the day and to examine one of the tools that independent experts all across the spectrum agree would be a solid addition and actually simplify the tax code while we can help people in low income and small business and provide incentives for america's global competitiveness, like we heard from the prime minister of india from that very rostrum just 2 days ago. i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. black. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. kelly), a colleague of mine and a member of the ways and means committee. mr. kelly of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman from tennessee (mrs. black). we see eye to eye on almost everything in our lives, and it is really good to be able to stand here today and speak so strongly in favor of h. con. res. 89. i really do appreciate the passion and sincerity of my colleagues across the aisle. what we are talking today is about policy. what we are talking about today is the all-important, unintended consequences that so often are put to blame for bad things that happen to american people. they are well intended, yes, at their conception, but very harmful. we are talking about a carbon tax, $10 a barrel on oil. and we are saying: well, don't worry about that because that is going to be charged upstream. that is going to be charged when it is taken out of the ground. but we all know that every single tax, every single cost is paid downstream. what do i mean by that? every day hardworking americans get up in the morning and want to put a roof over the heads of their families, food on the table, clothes on their back, and a little bit of money put away for their future. but every day we continue to come up with policies that somehow, although well intended, make it harder for them to make a living, make it harder for them to live the american dream, make it harder for them to get ready for the future. now, i know there are always going to be existential threats. i get that. my grandson is afraid to get out of bed at night because he thinks there is a monster under it. he thinks that if you get up in the middle of the night, maybe there is somebody in the closet or maybe there is something else. now, i am not a climate change denier. of course, the climate changes. i have seen it happen in my life. i have seen it where people say it is getting too cold and now it is getting too warm. well, you know what? it just changes. i get that. what doesn't change is the assault on the american people to pick up the tab on all of these costs. there is nothing that makes less sense to me than what we are doing. and back home where i come from, there is an old saying that goes something like this: measure twice and cut once. why? because once you do that cut, it is permanent. that is why you want to measure twice to make sure that the cut you make is the right cut. that is why you need to take the policies that affect everyday american people and make sure that you are not hurting them. well intended, i get it. i know it is well intended. i just don't think the american people have to pay the brunt of this. i am very aware of the prime minister of india being here wednesday. and i also know that between india and china, that is where the greatest pollution comes from. i get it. i get it. putting $10 a barrel on oil coming out of the ground just doesn't make sense. i would just like my friends on both sides of the aisle to think about somebody named steven jobs. steven jobs did not invent the pc because we taxed typewriters too high and caused the cost of that. innovation, of course, is the answer. and we have seen great innovation. i know where i am from in western pennsylvania, that clean coal is real. but the president promised, when he was running as a candidate, that he would put those who chose to make electricity by burning coal out of business. so we regulate them to the point where it is no longer cost efficient to do that, but we keep moving that way. the fact that 40,000 pennsylvanians make a living that way, well, don't worry about that, they will have to find something else to do. you can go down to west virginia and you can hear where candidates told them: listen, you are going to be out of business, but we will find something else for you to do and we will just get to that later. look, we have an opportunity today. this is a sense of congress to tell the american people what it is that we think goes on with this policy. for far too long we have turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to the people who sent us here to represent them. we talk very loftily about what it is that we would like to see, how it is that we would like it to go, our dream for the future. but we forget that every day, hardworking american taxpayers get up, throw their feet out over the side of the bed, and go to work for a very particular reason: their families, their churches, their schools, their communities and, more importantly, all of america. well intended, yes. but the results would be devastating. and who would pay this carbon tax? who would pay this $10 a barrel? it would be any man or woman who has to go out and buy anything for his or her family. it would be reflected in the cost of everything we put on our backs and everything we put in our mouths. it would affect everything we do when we travel from one point to another, but we say it is necessary. it is necessary because we have to tax this so high that we drive people away from it. i would hope that we could come together in america's house and do what is right for america's people, to do what is right for the people who sent us here to represent them because they are working so hard to make sure that there is a future for their children. in the last month when we created one job for every 8,000 americans-- one job for every 8,000 americans, are you kidding me?--in the greatest country the world has ever known, in a nation that leads the world in defending freedom and liberty, in a nation that knows that the best way to help others is through american participation---- the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mrs. black. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from pennsylvania. mr. kelly of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i do want to make sure that this final point comes across: we can work together for solutions. we can work together to do the same things for the same people that we all came here to represent. i do not think that there are ill-intended ideas on the other side. i think they are well-intended. i just think they are wrong. i think they are wrong for the times, and i think they are wrong for the american people. as i said earlier, where i am from, there are a lot of old adages. and one of them is: don't worry about the mule, just load the wagon. i will tell you right now that the mule is trying to find a way to unhook [[page h3672]] itself from the wagon because that load has gotten too heavy to pay. i know that the people who are loading the wagon think it is okay because at some point, that is going to have to be delivered somewhere. the truth of the matter is it is not. we have put too heavy a burden on american taxpayers, hardworking american taxpayers, hardworking americans. 1.4 million american lives have been sacrificed for the freedom and liberty not just of this country--our country and our nation--but for the whole world. so i say let's be careful before we do these well-intended but careless things. let's be careful before we turn our backs on the people who we actually represent here, and that is hardworking american people. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i couldn't agree more with my good friend from butler, pennsylvania, that we can actually come together and fashion solutions. that is why it is such a tragedy that this resolution comes to the floor without ever having our committee work on it, because we could have had hearings that could have narrowed those gaps. i include in the record a letter from six conservative advocates for climate change action. june 7, 2016. dear representative: later this week congress will take up a resolution sponsored by congressman scalise (r-la1) that expresses the sense of congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the economy of the united states. we are concerned that this resolution offers a limited perspective on carbon taxes and is blind to the potential benefits of market-based climate policy. legislation that incorporates a carbon tax could include regulatory and tax reforms to make the united states economy more competitive, innovative, and robust, benefiting both present and future generations. we recognize that a carbon tax, like any tax, will impose economic costs. but climate change is also imposing economic costs. this resolution falls short by recognizing the cost of action without considering the cost of staying on our present policy course. there are, of course, uncertainties about the future cost of climate change and, likewise, the cost associated with a carbon tax (much would depend on program design and the pace and nature of technological progress). the need for action, however, is clear. a recent survey of economists who publish in leading peer-reviewed journals on these matters found that 93% believe that a meaningful policy response to climate change is warranted. the least burdensome, most straightforward, and most market-friendly means of addressing climate change is to price the risks imposed by greenhouse gas emissions via a tax. this would harness price signals, rather than regulations, to guide market response. that is why carbon pricing has the support of free market economists, a majority of the global business community, and a large number of the largest multinational private oil and gas companies in the world (the corporate entities among the most directly affected by climate policy). in reaching a conclusion, this resolution neglects the fact that the united states already has a multiplicity of carbon taxes. they are imposed, however, via dozens of federal and state regulations, are invisible to consumers, unevenly imposed across industrial sectors, unnecessarily costly, and growing in size and scope. the policy choice is not if we should price carbon emissions, but how. unfortunately, this resolution also fails to differentiate between proposals that would impose carbon taxes on top of existing regulations (chiefly the obama administration's clean power plan), and proposals that would impose carbon taxes in place of those existing regulations. conservatives and free market advocates should embrace the latter, regardless of how they view climate risks. an economy-wide carbon tax that replaces existing regulatory interventions could reduce the cost of climate policy and deregulate the economy. it could also provide revenue to support pro-growth tax reform, including corporate income or payroll tax cuts, which could dramatically reduce overall costs on the economy. revenues could be applied to compensate those who suffer the most from higher energy costs; the poor, the elderly, and individuals and families living on fixed incomes. unfortunately, none of those options are presently available because members of congress have neglected opportunities to design and debate market-friendly climate policies in legislation. instead, they have yielded authority in climate policy design to the executive branch. by discouraging a long-overdue discussion about sensible carbon pricing, this resolution frustrates the development of better policy. sincerely, jerry taylor, president, niskanen center. bob inglis, executive director, republicen. aparna mathur, resident scholar, american enterprise institute. eli lehrer, president, r street institute. the rev. mitchell c. hescox, president, evangelical environmental network. alan viard, resident scholar, american enterprise institute. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, my friend from pennsylvania could have heard them talk about the need for action and how you can design a carbon tax that meets the objectives he is talking about, but we never did that. we didn't listen to experts across the spectrum--republican, democrat, conservative, liberal, economists, and scientists--to be able to examine the facts. instead, we have a cartoon proposal that they are arguing against as opposed to something that we could have worked on together that is promoted by most of the independent experts in the field. and someday within our lifetime this congress will consider and, i think, probably approve. i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from seattle, washington (mr. mcdermott), who has looked at some of these challenges around the globe. mr. mcdermott. mr. speaker, as i come to speak on the floor, i think i am in the house of the deniers. now, in 2007, that liberal journal, national geographic, had an article called ``the big thaw.'' and it says: ``it's no surprise that a warming climate is melting the world's glaciers and polar ice. but no one expected it to happen this fast.'' that was in 2007. that was 9 years ago. i was taken, along with gerry connolly, up to the arctic with the norweigian government. they are worried about what is happening. this resolution is just burying your head in the sand. i think you are thinking that if you put your head in the sand long enough, it will go away and, when you pull your head out, it won't be there. the cbo just put a report out: texas, louisiana, and florida are going to have hurricane damage that is unbelievable. fema already accounts for 45 percent of money spent on hurricane damage, $95 billion since 2000. now, if you think the insurance companies are going to keep insuring against hurricanes, you have another thing coming. at some point, they are going to say: we are not doing hurricane insurance in florida, louisiana, texas, and a whole bunch of other places. that is the economics. you say: let's not pay anything right now, let's not change anything, let's not work on it. but if we don't work on it, we are going to pay later. i am old enough to remember a fram commercial on the television. it was an air cleaner on your car, and it said: pay me now or pay me later. and this is what this is about today. now, there are things going on in this country which just absolutely boggle my mind. in north carolina, the assembly got together and they said: you know what? we are not going to spend any money to measure the sea levels. now, you have hundreds of miles of coastline in north carolina where the sea is rising and property values are going to be lost. we are talking money here. we are not talking soft, liberal stuff. this is real, and people don't want to even look at it. in florida and wisconsin, they took a novel approach and they said: we are not even going to use the words ``climate change'' in anything. now, here in congress, the climate deniers take many forms, from blocking the words ``social cost of carbon'' to directing the department of defense to ignore climate change. all the while, the dod itself highlights the threat of climate change to national security. republicans like to talk about national security. {time} 0945 the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. mr. mcdermott. if you are serious about talking about national security, [[page h3673]] you better start talking about the climate change that is going on in the world. sea lanes across the north pole are coming, boats are already coming, we are building the panama canal wider, and it is opening up on the north end of the globe. now, this absurdity cannot last, and we have got to begin to do what mr. blumenauer suggested. there have to be hearings. bob inglis, i knew him when he was here. god, he was a wild-eyed liberal. i couldn't believe what a wild-eyed liberal he was. he came down here talking about a carbon tax. i had a carbon tax. mr. larson had a carbon tax. this is not a partisan issue, democrat versus republican; it is whether or not you are going to look at the science of what is happening on the globe. i urge people to vote ``no'' on this. you will come back and do it in a couple of years. mrs. black. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana (mr. scalise), our majority whip. mr. scalise. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman from tennessee for yielding. i am proud to bring forward this legislation, mr. speaker, that expresses the strong sense of congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the united states economy. if you look at what this administration has done through radical rules and regulations, through all of its agencies, starting with the epa, with the irs, with the nlrb, the whole alphabet soup of federal agencies that every morning wake up trying to figure out how to make it harder for our economy to get moving again, how to make it harder for people to create jobs in america, frankly, the results of these radical regulations are shifting and running jobs away, out of our country to foreign countries like china, like india, and they want to keep it going. this is not a new concept, mr. speaker. they tried this years ago when they brought through the cap-and-trade bill. passed out of the house, it couldn't even pass in the senate when they had a supermajority in the senate with 60 votes because it was such a detrimental idea that would devastate our economy. yet even with that defeat, president obama still tries to come back with a carbon tax through other means, whether it is regulations or whether it is superimposed carbon taxes through the epa and some of the other things they are doing. we have had hearings on this, mr. speaker. there is data all around that confirms how devastating a carbon tax would be to the united states economy. you can just look at what some of the outside groups that look at this said. the national association of manufacturers, the people that make things in america, have confirmed we would lose more than a million jobs in america if a carbon tax was imposed. where would those jobs go? they would go to countries, ironically, that don't have the good environmental standards we already have. so they would go to countries like china and india where, if you are concerned about carbon going into the atmosphere, the things that they do to produce the same things we produce here in america, it creates more than five times the amount of carbon in those countries. so you are shifting jobs out of america to send it to countries where you would actually create more carbon. they talk about somehow being able to create policy that will stop hurricanes and change the sea level rising, for goodness sake, as if some policy is going to do that. by the way, the result of their policies will increase carbon in the earth's atmosphere. but let's not even talk about that. let's actually talk about the track record of this administration that now wants to control the earth's temperature. they spent over $500 million and couldn't even create a web site to take your health insurance requests, healthcare.gov. remember that? well, this same group now thinks they can control the earth's temperature through radical policies. again, let's look at the devastating impact these policies would have. they wouldn't work, first of all, but they would have a devastating impact on the middle class of this country. the congressional budget office, our own congressional budget office that looked at this, said a carbon tax would actually hit low-income people the hardest, even harder than high-income people. it would have a devastating impact on those people who are least able to afford it because it would increase the cost of everything they do. it would increase your food costs at the grocery store. it would increase, of course, what you pay at the pump. it would increase your electricity prices. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mrs. black. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman. mr. scalise. the heritage foundation looked at this and said that this kind of carbon tax would actually increase the cost of everything that families buy by over $1,400 per family. families are going to pay $1,400 more every year for the cost of a carbon tax that the other side wants to defend. and to yield what? to just yield an opportunity for countries like china and india to grow their economies at the expense of ours. so, mr. speaker, if you look at what they are trying to do--and, again, if you want to do this, bring it forward as an idea in legislation. they tried it with cap-and-trade, and it got defeated when democrats controlled everything. there is bipartisanship on this issue, and the bipartisanship is in opposition to a carbon tax. so why don't we go on record and be very clear about it, not just that it is bad policy, but also to reaffirm how devastating it would be for the united states economy. it shouldn't move forward. the president needs to stop this radical agenda and instead focus on reversing the depressing economic activity that we have seen in this country since he has been president because of these kinds of policies. let's get real economic growth. let's bring those jobs back to the united states. let's reject a carbon tax. i urge adoption of this resolution. mr. blumenauer. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i enjoyed my friend from louisiana's impassioned presentation. it is too bad that the committee on ways and means didn't actually sit down and go through the elements that would be in a balanced carbon tax. he is debating a cartoon version, not one that we worked on. i am going to yield, in a moment, to one of the gentlemen who, earlier in this carbon debate several congresses ago, has been involved with crafting a realistic carbon tax. we had the reference to the inability to move the cap-and-trade, which i don't think is as good as a carbon tax. it failed because there were a minority of the senate who were opposed to allowing it to go forward. it wasn't that we didn't have a majority that were interested. in the senate, you can have a veto with 41 people who are decided that they are not going to allow things to move forward. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from connecticut (mr. larson). he has been a student of a carbon tax, who has listened to those people across the political spectrum and has been a champion of a reasonable, thoughtful approach to promote american innovation. i would just point out the areas where we have had the greatest job growth in the energy sector have not been petroleum or coal. it has been solar and wind. a carbon tax would help accelerate that by leveling the playing field and allowing the forces of economics to dictate the next steps. mr. larson of connecticut. mr. speaker, i am delighted to be on the floor and join in this debate. i must, along with my colleague from oregon, express frustration. this body should be about the vitality of ideas. whatever those ideas are, in a democracy, there ought to be the willingness to express them. mr. blumenauer has detailed, at length, the lack of public hearings. listen, i get it. this is a messaging opportunity. this has no force of law. all this does is say what the sensibilities are of the congress. now, what does the public think of the sensibilities of the congress? what the public thinks is that we are all bluster and no solution and that we never take the time to sit down and measure twice and then cut. we just simply don't do that in our committees. [[page h3674]] and so the vitality of ideas, a very noble idea expressed by a republican, mr. inglis, many sessions ago and embraced by many conservative economists in the reagan, in the nixon, and in the bush administrations about providing certainty in terms of what we need to do and a revenue stream that has this at its core: tax pollution--tax pollution--at its source, and pass the savings on to the consumers. we know the volumes that are produced. we know the science behind this. there should be an open and clear-eyed debate on this; but not only a debate about the pros and cons, but how about something refreshing for the american people--a solution. it may not be the bill that i proposed or that bob inglis proposed or that any number of people have embraced, but you have major companies, including major oil companies that will be taxed, say, no, this is a sensible way for us to embrace this, and we are enjoined by the very people who this would tax and by conservative economists who say, yeah, we ought to take a look at this not only from the standpoint of the certainty that it will provide, but the known certainty of what pollution does. and it is not just about climate change. it is about the health of the air that we breathe, what we are poisoning in the atmosphere for our children, what happens with respect to the effects of asthma and what happens in terms of the people in coal mines from black lung disease. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. mr. larson of connecticut. these debilitating diseases scream out for the congress not to have a message opportunity that may or may not advantage one side or the other in the realm of politics, but how about a solution? how about us doing what mike kelly suggested, to work together in the committee to come up with a positive solution as to how to address this? pass the savings along to the consumer. develop a revenue system that will, in fact, allow us to rebuild our country that is crumbling around us. let's take those steps and the responsibility that we all have to the citizens to provide them with solutions, not bluster. mrs. black. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. lamalfa), a member of the committee on agriculture and committee on natural resources. mr. lamalfa. mr. speaker, i thank mrs. black and mr. boustany on these two concurrent resolutions that are being offered today. i appreciate the time. i recall in this debate here that there was a whole movie back in the 1960s called ``if it's tuesday, this must be belgium.'' well, if it is tax-raising time, this must be washington, d.c., because there are more schemes all the time to come hit not just big, evil corporations and big energy producers; this always ends up hitting the bottom line of american working families and the economy. the president's plan to raise a tax on each and every barrel of oil produced by $10 translates out to 25 cents at the pump. we heard earlier some of my colleagues talk about what the carbon tax would mean to working families--much more than they can afford in this bad economy and a time where the jobless rate is higher than is even measurable by this administration. this continues the antidomestically produced energy narrative of this administration. it only hurts u.s. energy jobs and takes productive u.s. fields, such as what we have in california, out of production that are on the margins of being profitable. instead of having domestically produced energy, we are going to shift more of that burden to other sources: foreign energy or the need for exploring more here or offshore. why don't we allow the profitable energy and oilfields we have in california and this country to continue to be productive and not hamper them with another additional tax that will take them out of production and rely more on foreign oil? now, how popular is this amongst regular people? in my own district, we conducted a survey recently where people actually took time to send postcards back into my office that came in at approximately a 90 percent rate in opposition to this $10-per-barrel oil tax, which they understand means 25 cents, again, per gallon at the gas pump. this really, really hurts all americans. it hurts working families, people on the lower end of the income scale, but even more so, districts like mine that are very rural and all the other rural districts around this country where people have to travel farther to get to their work, to take their kids to school or to healthcare appointments, their ball games, maybe even save up occasionally in this economy for a travel vacation they might like to take and visit the beauty of america. {time} 1000 so the rural economy is even more devastated by this--the rural economy that also would be productive with energy--with these schemes that are being pondered. additionally, there are other ideas, like a tax on every mile driven, which is being contemplated at some level here federally as well as in my own state. tax people for every mile they drive, tax them at the gas pump, tax them for carbon. again, this hits real people in america, not just some idea of a big, evil corporation. the answer in washington always seems to be more government and taxation that hurts working families. perhaps first, these dollars should be channeled into projects that people can use. not more environmental projects, but more highways, more bridges, more water storage. not boondoggles like we have in california, such as the high- speed rail money pit, or the cost of frivolous environmental measures that drive up the costs of construction projects and sometimes even completely eliminate them. we talk about a green economy a lot, especially on that side of the floor over there. why don't we focus on a green economy that is not based on importing solar panels from china or wind machines from europe? how about we get out and do the forestry that is needed to be done to thin the forests? we are talking about the air we breathe. each summer, for months, the air is brown in northern california--lots of california--and lots of the western states from forests that are burning because they are not managed, because they are not thinned. instead, they are overgrown. that would be a green economy. we could turn this into biomass if you want to have real energy that works for the equation of renewable energy. channel that effort into that instead of chasing these wind machines and solar panels. mr. speaker, this is why i support h. con. res. 112 and h. con. res. 89, to send a message that this is more job-killing taxes and schemes that will fix our economy. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mrs. black. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. mr. lamalfa. it is the freedom to explore for and produce low-cost domestic energy that will help americans and our economy to recover once again. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from maryland (mr. delaney), a gentleman who brings his private sector business success to commonsense solutions in policy. mr. delaney. i want to thank my friend from oregon for yielding. mr. speaker, today, my friends on the other side of the aisle are making four points. the first point they are making is that they don't believe in science, because the science around climate change is unassailable. the second point they are making is that they don't worry about american prosperity, because from an economic perspective and national security, the military, we should be reminded, has called climate change a threat multiplier. this is a very significant risk to long- term american prosperity. the third point they are making is that they don't believe in the power of markets to change behavior at its core. they are not acknowledging the power of a capitalistic economic model to change people's behavior. and the fourth thing they are saying is that they don't trust u.s. businesses to innovate into opportunities and around challenges. [[page h3675]] these are extraordinary statements. and contrast that with our approach. i have a piece of legislation called the tax pollution, not profits act, which puts in place a carbon pricing mechanism, which has been proven to be the most effective way--more effective than a regulatory approach--to change behavior and reverse some of the trends and bend the curve on climate change. we take the revenues that are generated by that bill and we use it to offset all of the costs that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say exist through tax credits to individuals. we set aside money to take care of the retirement of all the coal workers in the united states of america for the rest of their lives, and then we take the remaining revenues and we pay for a significant and substantial cut to business taxes. so this piece of legislation, unlike what my colleagues are proposing, has a double bottom line. it will reverse the negative effects of climate change and the threat to our prosperity, and it is a pro-growth policy because it puts money back in the economy and it makes a bet on u.s. businesses that they can innovate and grow into opportunities and around challenges. it is reflective of the view of businesses in 2016, not the view of businesses from the 1950s. mrs. black. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, may i ask how much time is remaining? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from oregon has 9\1/2\ minutes remaining. the gentlewoman from tennessee has 9 minutes remaining. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. huffman), my friend, who has spent a lot of time thinking about these environmental issues and acting on them. mr. huffman. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to these two resolutions. the first one, h. con. res. 89, says that a carbon tax would necessarily be detrimental to the united states economy. this is false. plain and simple. the truth is that we can and we must design carbon pollution reduction strategies to spur advancements in clean energy technology, reduce carbon pollution, and fight climate change. these strategies, including a carbon tax or a fee, can easily be designed to be revenue-neutral, and we know from long experience at the state and federal level that fighting pollution is good for jobs and good for the economy. california is a perfect example. if anyone has questions about this, come to california, where you will see that climate leadership is actually also good economics. it doesn't seem to matter to my colleagues who have offered these resolutions. in the year 2016, they continue to deny the reality of climate change. literally, our friends across the aisle are the last policymakers on the planet earth to hold this view. even in other oil- producing companies, the conservative parties in those countries acknowledge climate change, and they have positions in their party platforms that acknowledge we need to do something about it. now, the other resolution, h. con. res. 112, similarly demonstrates a lack of leadership by opposing president obama's proposal to finance infrastructure investments. those who don't support the president's infrastructure financing mechanism, i think, have a responsibility to offer their own solutions for our infrastructure crisis. this bill doesn't do that. instead, it simply describes a desire to support big oil. so here we have it: climate denial; the party that doesn't want to fill vacancies on the supreme court; a party that doesn't want to do its job to respond to public health crises, like zika; a party that prefers not to offer any solutions on our critical infrastructure funding needs. is this how we are going to make america great again? i don't think so. let's move forward in the 21st century and not let our energy and infrastructure policies be driven by 18th century thinking. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to oppose both of these bills. mrs. black. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. cartwright). mr. cartwright. mr. speaker, we are here debating h. con. res. 89, which purports to express the sense of congress. but really, nothing could be further from the truth, because what it does is express the nonsense of congress. we are here witnessing the latest example of climate denial brought to the floor by the majority. the entire world agrees that climate change is a pressing problem, except this extreme wing of the republican party. climate change is already affecting people across the globe. as dr. mcdermott from washington pointed out already, the nonpartisan cbo recently noted the increasing and enormous budgetary impact future storms will have on our nation, and attributed the majority of this problem to climate change. and i am here to tell you these costs will fall disproportionately on low-income people, low-income communities, and people of color in our country. are we here on the floor debating a real solution brought forward by the majority? are we here having hearings? no, we are not. we are here debating a resolution cutting off a solution that economists from all corners of the earth believe is the most efficient way to address climate change. a properly designed price on carbon can improve the overall performance of the u.s. economy, protect competitiveness, create jobs, promote investment, and lead us toward american energy independence. the gentleman from oregon is right: instead of debating this resolution, we should be having hearings discussing ways that we can sensibly lead the transition to renewable fuels and clean energy sources. even big oil companies like royal dutch shell and bp have voiced support for carbon taxes in recent years, acknowledging that climate change is real and that we should be doing something about it. and i say, mr. speaker, vote ``no'' on h. con. res. 89, and let's start a real debate, a sensible debate on this existential threat to our nation and to the globe. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. i really appreciate this little window of an opportunity to talk about a carbon tax. i hope that the day will come when we will have an opportunity to have that discussion in a robust and thoughtful way in our ways and means committee. heaven knows it is important. lots of people have opinions and ideas. i think we would benefit from it, but i hope that we will have that discussion after we hear from a balanced, wide-ranging group of independent experts across the spectrum to be able to give us meaningful information about it. i include in the record a letter from greg dotson, who is the vice president for energy policy at the center for american progress. center for american progress, washington, dc, june 8, 2016. dear representative: later this week, the u.s. house of representatives will consider h. con. res. 89, a resolution that rejects the pricing of carbon pollution. on behalf of the center for american progress, i am writing to urge you to oppose this resolution. it is time for congress to develop sensible policies that address the serious and potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change. science informs us that we need an urgent solution to this problem. although the current administration has made historic progress on climate change, it is clear that we need to do more to achieve additional carbon pollution reductions and lead the world in responding to this global challenge. top economic advisors to both democratic and republican presidents have expressed their support for putting a price on carbon as an effective and efficient approach for reducing pollution. joseph stiglitz, former chairman of the council of economic advisors (cea) under president bill clinton, has stated, ``economic efficiency requires that those who generate emissions pay the cost, and the simplest way of forcing them to do so is through a carbon tax.'' gregory mankiw, former chairman of the cea under president george w. bush, has stated, ``basic economics tells us that when you tax something, you normally get less of it. so if we want to reduce global emissions of carbon, we need a global carbon tax.'' in fact, carbon pollution is already priced in a significant portion of the world. in total, about 40 national jurisdictions and more than 20 cities, states, and regions on [[page h3676]] five continents--representing almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions--have placed a price on carbon. in the united states, 25 percent of the population lives in a jurisdiction where carbon pollution is currently priced and where one-third of the country's economic activity takes place. the price on carbon in california is the highest of any state in the country at almost $13 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, and yet the california economy is projected to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the united states over the next two years. in recent years, momentum to expand the adoption of carbon pricing policies has been growing. more than 400 investors with more than $24 trillion in assets have called on governments to establish ``stable, economically meaningful carbon pricing.'' already, more than 1,000 businesses apply a price on carbon to inform their investments and operations or plan to do so in the next two years. in addition, at the united nations climate talks in paris last december, governments, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations announced the new carbon pricing leadership coalition to accelerate and expand the adoption of carbon pricing worldwide. in order to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, the united states needs to consider all possible tools at its disposal, including the effective market-based mechanisms of carbon pricing. members of congress need to work together on a bipartisan basis to find ways to cut carbon pollution rather than advance polarizing measures that take useful tools off the table. i urge you to reject this ill-advised resolution. sincerely, greg dotson, vice president for energy policy, center for american progress. mr. blumenauer. let me just read a couple of items from mr. dotson's letter. he points out that ``top economic advisors to both democratic and republican presidents have expressed their support for putting a price on carbon as an effective and efficient approach for reducing pollution.'' he cites gregory mankiw, former chairman of the council of economic advisers under president george w. bush, who says: ``basic economics tells us that when you tax something, you normally get less of it. so if we want to reduce global emissions of carbon, we need a global carbon tax.'' ``in fact, carbon pollution is already priced in a significant portion of the world. in total, about 40 national jurisdictions and more than 20 cities, states, and regions on five continents-- representing almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions--have placed a price on carbon. in the united states, 25 percent of the population lives in jurisdictions where carbon pollution is currently priced and where one-third of the country's economic activity takes place.'' that is in america right now. there is no acknowledgment of that in this debate. we could have talked about that in the committee. ``the price on carbon in california,'' referenced by my friend, mr. huffman, ``is the highest of any state in the country at almost $13 per ton . . . yet the california economy is projected to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the united states over the next two years.'' they reference the fact that ``more than 400 investors with more than $24 trillion in assets have called on governments to establish `stable, economically meaningful carbon pricing.' already, more than 1,000 businesses apply a price on carbon to inform their investments and operations or plan to do so in the next two years. in addition, at the united nations climate talks in paris last december, governments, business, nongovernmental organizations announced the new carbon pricing leadership coalition to accelerate and expand the adoption of carbon pricing worldwide,'' in keeping with what we heard from prime minister modi in this chamber just 2 days ago. {time} 1015 yet my friends on the other side of the aisle are not involved with our being able to discuss this in depth, being able to bring in the experts, being able to work together to design a pricing mechanism that avoids some of the cartoon characteristics that they establish here. we had that chance, and we haven't done it. but this will not be the last word. this meaningless resolution will undoubtedly pass today. it is not going to have any impact in terms of the long term. the long term, we are on a path to price carbon, and we have the capacity to do so in a thoughtful and an effective way, like the conservative leaders, whose correspondence i put into the record earlier, suggest. it can be revenue neutral. it can be effective. it can help reverse the more damaging effects of climate change, and it is a way to promote economic opportunity and global competitiveness. i appreciate the opportunity to express my views on this. i yield back the balance of my time. mrs. black. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. you know, although my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made this a conversation about climate change--which i agree that we can have and we should have in another venue, and that is in the committee structure--this is about a president who decided on his own, without coming to congress to discuss this tax, this $10 tax on a barrel of gasoline, because he was unable to get this carbon tax, when, by the way, the house and the senate were both in his own party, he couldn't even get this passed. so this is a discussion for another day about climate change, which we can all have, and have in a very gentle way. however, let me sum up what this would do if this were to pass, the impact that this carbon tax would have on the american people: it would drive up the cost of energy, which would most affect those at the lower income. it would destroy well-paying jobs in the energy industry, well-paying jobs. right now, when we look at what our loss of jobs are here in this country, we have the lowest rate of jobs in 6 years. number three, it would directly hit working families the most, those at the very lowest income, and especially those who are elderly. none of these help to grow our economy and get our economy moving or people back to work or raise their incomes. therefore, i urge a ``yes'' vote on h. con. res. 89. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, i include the following letter from opponents of h. con. res. 89: june 7, 2016. dear representative: on behalf of our millions of members and supporters, the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose h. con. res. 89. this resolution is the latest example of climate action denial being advanced by extreme members of the house of representatives. instead of listening to the national security experts, faith leaders, scientists, energy innovators, health professionals and many others who are sounding the alarm on climate change and have implored our nation's elected officials to support action, rep. scalise and the co-sponsors of h. con. res. 89 appear to be looking for another way to say ``no.'' the sponsors of the resolution have no plan to address climate change and have opposed every proposal to do something about the planet's gravest environmental problem. many of them don't even accept the scientific fact that climate change is occurring. h. con. res. 89 ignores the huge costs that our country is already experiencing due to climate change--costs that fall disproportionately on low-income communities and communities of color. it is clear this resolution is meant to put the interests of the polluting fossil fuel companies ahead of the american public's best interest. instead of holding another just-for-show vote against climate action, the u.s. house of representatives should be debating how it can best position our country to lead the global transition to clean energy sources. last year more than half of the world's new energy came from renewable energy sources and the landmark paris climate agreement sends a powerful signal to investors that this trend toward low- carbon energy will accelerate. more and more countries and hundreds of forward-looking companies are adopting policies to limit carbon pollution and correct the markets failure to capture the health and environmental costs of burning fossil fuels. at a time when the american taxpayer is already paying to move vulnerable american communities to higher ground because of climate-driven sea level rise, we have no time to waste on empty resolutions that seek to take potential climate solutions off the table.

voters, natural resources defense council, public citizen, sierra club, southern environmental law center, union of concerned scientists. the speaker pro tempore. all time for debate has expired.

This book, printed by the Government Publishing Office, contains 378 pages of names, addresses, and the contact information for Members of Congress and their staffs. While the Clerk of the House does get a deal from the GPO on these printing costs, this directory is sold to the public online at a cost of $52 per book. GPO stated that 14,080 copies of this directory were sent this year to the House Postal Operations for delivery. This year, all 435 House Member offices received this stack--this whole stack right here--unsolicited from the Office of the Clerk, 20 copies, total, for each office. Each year we get this directory and, to be frank, it is not needed. All the information contained within these pages is readily available online, both publicly and through House Web sites. To make matters worse, often, the information contained is out of date by the time we receive these bound copies. For example, by the time I received my 20 copies of this directory, the information listed for my staff was no longer current. According to a CRS report from 2011, approximately 97 percent of all government documents originate in digital form and are distributed electronically but are not printed. This same CRS report estimated that it costs Congress about $134 per page for prepress costs for miscellaneous publications, of which this directory is one. Madam Chairman, I don't think I need to remind anyone here that we are currently $19 trillion-plus in debt as a result of excessive and unnecessary spending. I will be the first to admit that this amendment will not be saving millions of dollars this year alone, but in a time of such financial crisis, we should remain vigilant and save every penny we can. This book is unnecessary, and its unsolicited distribution en masse is excessive. Why does each D.C. office get 20 unsolicited copies? My D.C. office only has eight employees, none of which utilize these wasteful directories. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that will save precious taxpayer money and prevent future unsolicited deliveries of this directory in every single House office on the Hill. I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their work on this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Gosar The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the Budget of the United States Government; Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the United States Government; or the Appendix, Budget of the United States Government, to the office of any Member of the House of Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress). The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairman, I rise today to offer another commonsense amendment that will prevent wasteful spending in this bill by preventing the delivery of this packet of nearly 2,000 pages containing the President's budget request to 435 House congressional offices. In its 2017 budget justification, the Government Publishing Office states: ``Since 2012, GPO has made the annual Budget of the U.S. Government available as a mobile app. The FY 2016 Budget app, released in January of 2015, provided users with access to the text and images of the Budget, including the Budget Message of the President, information on the President's priorities, and budget overviews organized by agency. This app provides links to GPO's FDsys where summary tables and additional books of the Budget, including the Analytical Perspectives, Appendix, and Historical Tables, are available.'' This package, which contains the President's budget, analytical perspectives of the budget, and the appendix of the budget are all available on an app for your phone for free. Furthermore, all three are available in their entirety online at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ , where they are more easily searchable. While the Office of Management and Budget does get a great deal from GPO on printing costs, each individual copy sells online for $38, $56, and $79, respectively. These documents comprise 170 pages, 409 pages, and 1,413 pages, respectively. OMB orders one copy of the budget for all 435 Members of the House, and this publication is then printed by the Government Publishing Office and delivered by House Postal Operations. In a time when our Nation is facing a fiscal crisis and has a $19 trillion-plus debt as a result of excessive and unnecessary spending, we should not be squandering more money printing nearly 2,000 pages of the President's budget that most Members throw in the trash, recycle, or don't even open. Furthermore, this massive document is not even a serious proposal and has been routinely rejected with strong bipartisan support. The Senate defeated President Obama's budget by a vote of 97-0 for fiscal year 2011, 99-0 in fiscal year 2012, and 98-1 last year. Again, I will be the first one to admit that this amendment will not save millions of dollars this year alone, but, in a time of such fiscal crisis, we should remember the old adage that a penny saved is a penny earned. The printing and distribution of the President's budget to 435 House offices is excessive. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and we will save precious taxpayer money and prevent future mass deliveries. Again, all these publications are online in their entirely, where they are more easily searchable, and they are also on a free mobile app. I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their work on this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Grayson The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 114-611. [[Page H3685]] Mr. GRAYSON. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to enter into a contract with any offeror or any of its principals if the offeror certifies, as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation, that the offeror or any of its principals-- (1) within a three-year period preceding the offer, has been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against it for commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (2) are presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated above in paragraph (1); or (3) within a three-year period preceding the offer, has been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. GRAYSON. Madam Chair, this is an amendment that is identical to other amendments that have been inserted by voice vote into every appropriations bill considered under an open rule during the 113th and 114th Congresses. I extend my thanks to the Rules Committee for ruling this amendment in order. My amendment expands the list of parties with whom the Federal Government is prohibited from contracting due to serious misconduct on the part of the contractors. I hope that this amendment remains noncontroversial, as it has been, and will again be passed unanimously by the House. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz). Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment. This is a commonsense amendment which would prohibit funding in this bill from being used to pay contractors engaged in fraud or tax evasion. As the gentleman said, similar amendments have been adopted on other appropriations bills. I urge Members to vote ``aye.'' Mr. GRAYSON. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Takano The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. There is appropriated, for salaries and expenses of the Office of Technology Assessment as authorized by the Technology Assessment Act of 1972 (2 U.S.C. 471 et seq.) $2,500,000, to be derived from a reduction of $2,500,000 in the amount provided in this Act for the item for ``Architect of the Capitol, Capital Construction and Operations''. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of my amendment, which would restore funding to the Office of Technology Assessment, or OTA. The foundation for good policy is accurate and objective analysis; and for more than two decades, the OTA set that foundation by providing relevant, unbiased technical and scientific assessments for Members of Congress and staff. In 1995, the OTA was defunded, stripping Congress of a valuable resource to understand both emerging technologies as well as the nuances of the legislative process. In its absence, the need for OTA has only grown. Many of the issues OTA studied 20 years ago are even more pressing today: antibiotic-resistant bacteria, electronic surveillance in the digital age, and testing in America's schools. These are the complex challenges our Nation will continue to face, and Congress should have access to the thorough and insightful analysis OTA can provide. Investing in the OTA now will actually save us money in the future. In the last year it operated, OTA's budget was $23 million, but its studies on the Synthetics Fuels Corporation saved taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. Our amendment restores a modest $2.5 million to the OTA account for salaries and expenses to begin rebuilding the office. The cost is offset by a reduction of the same amount to the AOC's capital construction and operations account, which is an administrative account. So this will not take resources from specific construction projects. Madam Chair, a great surgeon does not operate without modern tools, a master chef does not cook without fresh ingredients, and Members of Congress should not make policy decisions without relevant and unbiased information. I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on this amendment to restore funding to the Office of Technology Assessment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I want to thank the gentleman from California. I know he has great intentions with this amendment. As we discuss the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, we are really discussing what is important to the House of Representatives, because that is what this bill reflects. I know that this office was created in 1972 and was eliminated years later, but in 1972, I was 2 years old. Technology was very different. I see no need to re-create something that was started dealing with technology when I was 2 years old, almost two decades prior to the first Web site. Currently, these tasks are being handled by GAO. They are being handled sufficiently. They are being handled with the $2.5 million already, and we have yet to receive any complaints. Now, if there is a more comprehensive need for technology assessment, I think that is a bigger discussion for cyber policy in general, and that is a conversation that should take place outside of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee's jurisdiction. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz). Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I rise in support of the amendment to revive the Office of Technology Assessment. When I was chair of the subcommittee, we tried to restart it within the Government Accountability Office. In fiscal years 2008 to 2010, I included $2.5 million in this bill with GAO to support that initiative. However, the supporters of the amendment make an impassioned case that the Office of Technology Assessment should be a part of Congress itself, rather than GAO, in order to provide objective analysis of complex, scientific, and technical issues which certainly, I think we can all agree, actually exist today. We are not trying to go back to 20th century technology. We have important issues that need to be reviewed, and we don't always have the expertise in Congress necessary to be able to make sure we can get that cogent analysis, particularly when we are still at funding levels back to 2010 in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. This is a bill in which we are tackling copyright modernization, specifically dealing with technology challenges, and an OTA would add to the rigor of our analysis on that topic and others. I urge support of the amendment. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I will just point out that one of our focuses in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill is to be very responsible with taxpayer dollars. During these lean times when we are $19 trillion in debt, we have really led the [[Page H3686]] charge when it comes to reducing spending from our operations, down 13.2 percent. We have eliminated some agencies and programs and even, in this bill, eliminate the Open World Center. {time} 1130 I don't see this as the time that we need to restart a new program that was eliminated 20 years ago. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, how much time is remaining on my side? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), a member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and a respected physicist. Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, thank you to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) and to my colleagues, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) and the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan) for helping to bring this amendment to the floor. This amendment would provide $2.5 million to resurrect the Office of Technology Assessment to revive this crucial service of providing Congress with unbiased, nonpartisan reports on a wide range of issues in science and technology. This office is no less necessary today than when it first started in 1972. As technology continues to advance at an increasingly rapid pace and our partisan divide seems to grow deeper, Congress needs this now more than ever. I ask my colleagues to consider just one single one of the recommendations from the Office of Technology Assessment, that the United States rapidly adopt a standardized electronic medical record format. Had this been done, we would have been able to save hundreds of millions of dollars in medical costs over the last decades and hundreds of thousands of lives of Americans through prevention of preventable medical accidents. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to restore this vital source of credible and nonpartisan scientific expertise in Congress. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I reiterate my support for the Office of Technology Assessment. Congress does not suffer from a lack of information, but it suffers from a lack of trusted information to help make wise policy decisions. We need information that is not spun even by our own agencies, the FBI or other agencies. We need information that is not spun from particular sectors. This agency, this Office of Technology Assessment, will be overseen by a bipartisan group of lawmakers who will vet the experts that work for it. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I will just again thank my colleague from California for his thoughtful and well-debated argument here for the need, as he sees it. I will again reiterate that the GAO provides a valuable service which I believe can continue doing the job that is necessary. In these lean times, I would encourage our colleagues to oppose this amendment not because of the gentleman from California, but just because of the lean times and the concept in which it is just not the right time to adopt that. I will oppose the amendment. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Russell The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the Federal Register to a Member of the House of Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress) unless the Member requests a copy. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Chair, the fiscal year 2017 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act contains several excellent provisions to cut down on unnecessary printing of paper documents in the House of Representatives. Section 102 of the act, for example, prohibits printed copies of bills from being sent to Members of Congress unless they specifically request them. This amendment is very similar. It prohibits the Federal Register from being sent to Members unless they specifically request it. It uses the exact same terminology as section 102. The Federal Register, while important because it contains rules, proposals, and various other publications released by Federal agencies, unfortunately every business day Members of Congress receive paper copies of this Register, while it is available online and queryable. Sadly, most of these hundreds of pages in length end up in the waste bin. The Federal Register, being available online, is a better way to go with this measure. The Government Printing Office sends 617 copies of the Register every single day to House Members alone. This includes subscriptions for personal offices, committees, archival offices, and others. Each annual subscription costs the Government Printing Office $750 a year to produce in paper and ink alone. These costs are charged to Federal agencies that publish in the Federal Register. Among all the Members of Congress and six nonvoting Members in the House, paying for an annual subscription for all of these costs and other estimated delivery costs exceeds $400,000 annually. To put that into perspective, that could pay for the annual salaries of a dozen Special Forces sergeants who are defending our country abroad. None of the funds made available by this act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the Federal Register to a Member of the House of Representatives, including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to Congress, unless the Members request specifically a copy. This simple amendment will build on the reforms of the congressional printing of sections 102, 103, and 105, allowing Federal agencies to better use precious taxpayer dollars. I encourage support for this amendment, Madam Chair, because, once again, we will never win the war on our national debt in some giant spending measure that will only divide us within our respective parties and within the Chamber. Instead, we will win it by combating waste one agency at a time. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Pearce The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $190,970)''. Page 5, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $190,970)''. Page 6, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $190,970)''. Page 42, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert ``(increased by $190,970)''. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico. Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. [[Page H3687]] Madam Chair, despite what has been said about this amendment, it is very simple. There are two bodies that are funded through the appropriations process in the U.S. Congress. One is the House Committee on Ethics. That is the one that we all know as Members of Congress. But there is another body called the Office of Congressional Ethics that works pretty well outside of this body. Now, my amendment is simply taking this year's increase away from that outside body. Again, no change to the ethical process inside the body, the one that we are all familiar with and feel accountable to. But we are deducting $191,000 from this outside group because in this time of budget constraints, when I look at my office and all the other offices, our spending has been reduced. Our budgets have been reduced by approximately $200,000 since 2008. Now, we have to deal with 750,000 to 900,000 constituents. I have five field offices. Generally we drive, as a staff, somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 miles per year to deal with our constituents. Our budgets have gone down $200,000, with a small increase this year of $12,000. Then, on the other hand, I see a $191,000 increase on this outside group. I just feel like that is extraordinary and would suggest that the appropriations bill, H.R. 5325, be reduced in that amount in this budget area. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, the Office of Congressional Ethics is crucial to ensuring accountability and transparency in this body. Any attempts to cut its budget would only serve to erode our constituents' trust and faith in Congress, which certainly has already suffered a significant amount of erosion. As many of my colleagues will recall, the House created the Office of Congressional Ethics nearly a decade ago to improve the integrity of the ethics process in the House. The House was recovering from the Mark Foley scandal, and it was clear that we needed to do something to rebuild the American people's trust in their elected Representatives. That is why OCE's core ``mission is to assist the U.S. House in upholding high ethical standards with an eye toward increasing transparency and providing information to the public.'' I acknowledge that there are proposals to improve the operations of the Office of Congressional Ethics, and we should certainly take a look at those, Madam Chair, but it is common sense that these improvements can't be made by cutting funding for the office that we are actually seeking to improve. Moreover, the issue of congressional ethics is far too important to reduce to a 10-minute debate on the House floor. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided amendment. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chair, I find it odd that we received the words today on the House floor that we are going to increase transparency through the Office of Congressional Ethics. That is exactly what they do not do. The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution gives the accused the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. I will quote from a letter, a legal letter that was given to the OCE: This investigation has again revealed due process deficiencies within the OCE rules. While the Sixth Amendment of the United States provides for the fundamental right to confront one's accusers, the OCE rules do not allow to confront the accused with the accusers. Secondly, the Sixth Amendment gives us the right to a lawyer. I will again quote from Paul Solis, an employee of the OCE, in an email to my chief of staff: I forgot to mention on our call that should you retain a lawyer for the office, that lawyer would most likely be prohibited under our rules from representing a subject of this review to the extent that subject is a current staff member. So the OCE, in their email to our office, says you don't have the right to legal counsel, even though the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution says that you do. The third thing that I see is that we should be able to find out the nature of the charges under the Sixth Amendment. Again, our experience and the experience of others who have confronted OCE realizes you do not know what the charges are, you are not going to get to get a lawyer, and you cannot know who is accusing you. This hardly meets the word ``transparency'' that my good friend alluded to. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, while I can appreciate the gentleman's concerns, he has listed a number of substantive differences of opinion with the way the Office of Congressional Ethics handles their work. This appropriations bill is not the appropriate place to address those. The Office of Congressional Ethics was created through legislation. It is a substantive issue, and it is one that should be debated and discussed on an authorizing bill, not on the funding of the legislative branch. You don't just cut the budget of an office with whose decisions you disagree. We can debate and discuss these concerns, but cutting $190,000 out of the OCE's budget is not the way to address that. For those reasons and the fact that the public already has some pretty significant concerns with the way we do business here, this would send the wrong message. If we are going to have this discussion, we should do it in a forum that allows for more robust discussion and debate over how to address those challenges long term. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1145 Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chair, I would remind my friend and colleague that this amendment only addresses the funding. I simply used my time in order to advertise for this agency and the way that they operate. I would like to quote from an email that I got this morning: I cried when I saw what your boss did last night on the Leg Branch. This is referring to my amendment. I was unfairly targeted by OCE in 2013, for an action in 2008, which had been approved by the Ethics Committee. OCE even admitted there was no evidence. I complied with every provision of the policy, without exception. One of the staffers that was being investigated in this same circumstance left the Hill early on. I considered doing the same thing. I certainly had to endure all the phases of the OCE process, including referral to the Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee dismissed the case against us, but it is, by far, the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my 21 years on the Hill. I am a strong person with resources, and was an emotional wreck over the thought of losing my credibility over an ethics investigation. I cried virtually every day for several months. And the prolonged process over many, many months took a toll on my life. And we are asking to give this agency another $191,000 to continue this kind of action? I think this debate is exactly called for at this moment on this bill and on this spending. Madam Chair, I urge Members to support the amendment to give notice to the OCE that we are watching what they are doing. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida has 3 minutes remaining. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I have tremendous respect for the gentleman from New Mexico and his concerns for the operation of the Office of Congressional Ethics. However, all that we would be doing here, if his amendment were to pass, is to send a $190,000 message to the Office of Congressional Ethics. It would not achieve any of the gentleman's goals. If we do need to take a look at the way the office functions, then there is a process for doing that. The only thing we achieve here by adopting this amendment is cutting their budget by $190,000. So, if the majority believes that it is important to take a look at the function of this office, then there is a process for doing that and to take up legislation to change the way they do business. That is certainly appropriate. But we don't accomplish any of the gentleman's goals by cutting $190,000. [[Page H3688]] In fact, the public has certainly already sent multiple messages to the United States Congress that they don't have a whole lot of confidence in the business that we are doing here. This would send the absolute wrong message back to them--that we don't get it. So I urge Members to oppose the amendment because it would not achieve the gentleman's goals and because we have a more appropriate place to actually achieve those goals in the authorizing committee. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR.

So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren) having assumed the chair, Ms. Foxx, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5325) making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 771, she reported the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The amendments were agreed to. [[Page H3691]] The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. CASTRO of Texas. I am opposed to it in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Castro of Texas moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5325 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: In the ``Capital Construction and Operations'' account, on page 17, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $200,000)''. In the ``Library of Congress--Salaries and Expenses'' account, on page 25, line 24, after the first dollar amount, insert ``(increased by $200,000)''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, before I speak on this amendment, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who has been a strong advocate and leader on this issue, for an opportunity to say a few words. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleague, Congressman Joaquin Castro, to urge the majority to finally allow the House to strike a destructive political provision that has made its way into the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. If those listening are wondering why we are talking about the pejorative term ``illegal aliens'' on the bill that funds the legislative branch, then you are not alone. This legislation's accompanying report includes language that would have the Library continue to use the term ``illegal aliens,'' ``to the extent practicable''--even though the Library itself has said that there is no practicable means to continue to use the term ``illegal aliens.'' The Library changes thousands of subject headings each year without interference from Congress. Why this one? Why now? The Library once used the subject heading ``Negro,'' then moved to ``Afro-American,'' and now ``African American.'' They didn't wait until the entire U.S. Code was free of the pejorative term ``Negro'' before they changed their subject heading. As a matter of fact, Congress only recently removed the last vestiges of the terms ``Negro'' and ``Oriental'' from the U.S. Code in May of 2016. That bill passed with a unanimous vote, including the ``yes'' vote of the chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. If we removed ``Negro'' and ``Oriental'' in the subject headings of the Library of Congress before we changed the U.S. Code, then we should do the same for the now-pejorative term, ``illegal alien.'' The Library of Congress is our Nation's first established cultural institution, and it is hard to fathom why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would try to tie its hands to the slow-moving wheels of the U.S. Code. Entering into an immigration debate on the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill is a terrible precedent. If the majority is really serious about debating the U.S. Code, then let's have the Republican Rules Committee bring up the Castro bill that would remove the hurtful and inaccurate term ``illegal aliens'' once and for all from the U.S. Code. We are Members of Congress, not captains of the word police. Free the card catalog and depoliticize this bill. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes and 35 seconds remaining. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in 1922, the only grandparent I would come to know came from Mexico to the United States. She was not a rapist or a murderer or an alien. She was a 6-year-old girl whose parents had died around the time of the Mexican Revolution, and the closest relatives who could take her and her sister in were in Texas. I bet if we went around this Chamber, I know there would be beautiful stories, similar stories, of ancestors who came from Italy, Germany, Ireland, Africa, Asia, and every corner of the world. They are the immigrants to this country. They are the strength of this country. Language matters. Recently, the Library of Congress decided to retire the term ``illegal alien'' because it is dehumanizing. For the first time in American history, today, the Congress is ready to interfere with the business of the Library of Congress. In the years of the Congress and the Library, language has evolved. That is why we have done away with terms like ``Negro,'' ``Oriental,'' ``lunatic,'' and ``retarded,'' because we understand that even words that start off as neutral descriptors can, over time, become used as verbal weapons and knives to inflict pain and disrespect and sow division. That is the case today. There are times in our country's history where our politics have also been a race to the bottom. Those Irish ancestors were greeted by signs that read ``no Irish need apply'' in cities like New York and Boston. The Japanese, German, and Italian Americans even were interned during World War II. Chinese were excluded from this country for decades. During the Eisenhower administration, many Hispanics in this country were rounded up and deported to Mexico even if they were American. {time} 1230 What I am asking is for us not to fuel the flames of this season and for us to take a better course and do the right thing. I am asking you to support this motion to recommit because the words ``illegal alien'' will be retired. This will change, whether it is now or 6 months from now or 10 years from now. The question for all of us is whether we, today, will do the right thing or whether a few years from now we apologize for doing the wrong thing. Please support this motion to recommit and do the right thing. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to make this quick because I want to make sure the House knows what offensive language is in this bill. It is so offensive that I am going to read it. To the extent practicable, the committee instructs the Library to maintain certain subject headings that reflect terminology used in title 8, United States Code. That is what is so offensive to the minority party. For 7\1/2\ years, we have had a President who wants to ignore the intent of the laws of our land. We will not allow this body, this House, to ignore the definitions nor the words of the laws that have been voted on in this body, passed by the Senate, and signed into law by the President. I am asking this body to vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit, vote ``yes'' to uphold the laws of this land, vote ``yes'' for your constituents on final passage, and have a good weekend. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Recorded Vote Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5- minute votes on passage of the bill, adoption of House Concurrent Resolution 89, and adoption of House Concurrent Resolution 112. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 170, noes 237, not voting 27, as follows: [[Page H3692]] [Roll No. 293] AYES--170 Aguilar Ashford Bass Beatty Becerra Bera Beyer Bishop (GA) Blumenauer Bonamici Boyle, Brendan F.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the further consideration of H.R. 5325 and that I may include tabular material on the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 771 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 5325. Will the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) kindly take the chair. {time} 1114 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole [[Page H3684]] House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 5325) making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, with Ms. Foxx (Acting Chair) in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Thursday, June 9, 2016, the Chair had announced that it was in order to consider amendment No. 7, printed in House Report 114-611. {time} 1115 Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Gosar The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the United States House of Representatives Telephone Directory to the office of any Member of the House of Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress). The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment that will prevent wasteful spending in this bill and the unsolicited delivery of printed copies of the House telephone directory to 435 House congressional offices. I hold here the United States House of Representatives Telephone Directory for 2016. This book, printed by the Government Publishing Office, contains 378 pages of names, addresses, and the contact information for Members of Congress and their staffs. While the Clerk of the House does get a deal from the GPO on these printing costs, this directory is sold to the public online at a cost of $52 per book. GPO stated that 14,080 copies of this directory were sent this year to the House Postal Operations for delivery. This year, all 435 House Member offices received this stack--this whole stack right here--unsolicited from the Office of the Clerk, 20 copies, total, for each office. Each year we get this directory and, to be frank, it is not needed. All the information contained within these pages is readily available online, both publicly and through House Web sites. To make matters worse, often, the information contained is out of date by the time we receive these bound copies. For example, by the time I received my 20 copies of this directory, the information listed for my staff was no longer current. According to a CRS report from 2011, approximately 97 percent of all government documents originate in digital form and are distributed electronically but are not printed. This same CRS report estimated that it costs Congress about $134 per page for prepress costs for miscellaneous publications, of which this directory is one. Madam Chairman, I don't think I need to remind anyone here that we are currently $19 trillion-plus in debt as a result of excessive and unnecessary spending. I will be the first to admit that this amendment will not be saving millions of dollars this year alone, but in a time of such financial crisis, we should remain vigilant and save every penny we can. This book is unnecessary, and its unsolicited distribution en masse is excessive. Why does each D.C. office get 20 unsolicited copies? My D.C. office only has eight employees, none of which utilize these wasteful directories. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that will save precious taxpayer money and prevent future unsolicited deliveries of this directory in every single House office on the Hill. I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their work on this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Gosar The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the Budget of the United States Government; Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the United States Government; or the Appendix, Budget of the United States Government, to the office of any Member of the House of Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress). The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairman, I rise today to offer another commonsense amendment that will prevent wasteful spending in this bill by preventing the delivery of this packet of nearly 2,000 pages containing the President's budget request to 435 House congressional offices. In its 2017 budget justification, the Government Publishing Office states: ``Since 2012, GPO has made the annual Budget of the U.S. Government available as a mobile app. The FY 2016 Budget app, released in January of 2015, provided users with access to the text and images of the Budget, including the Budget Message of the President, information on the President's priorities, and budget overviews organized by agency. This app provides links to GPO's FDsys where summary tables and additional books of the Budget, including the Analytical Perspectives, Appendix, and Historical Tables, are available.'' This package, which contains the President's budget, analytical perspectives of the budget, and the appendix of the budget are all available on an app for your phone for free. Furthermore, all three are available in their entirety online at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ , where they are more easily searchable. While the Office of Management and Budget does get a great deal from GPO on printing costs, each individual copy sells online for $38, $56, and $79, respectively. These documents comprise 170 pages, 409 pages, and 1,413 pages, respectively. OMB orders one copy of the budget for all 435 Members of the House, and this publication is then printed by the Government Publishing Office and delivered by House Postal Operations. In a time when our Nation is facing a fiscal crisis and has a $19 trillion-plus debt as a result of excessive and unnecessary spending, we should not be squandering more money printing nearly 2,000 pages of the President's budget that most Members throw in the trash, recycle, or don't even open. Furthermore, this massive document is not even a serious proposal and has been routinely rejected with strong bipartisan support. The Senate defeated President Obama's budget by a vote of 97-0 for fiscal year 2011, 99-0 in fiscal year 2012, and 98-1 last year. Again, I will be the first one to admit that this amendment will not save millions of dollars this year alone, but, in a time of such fiscal crisis, we should remember the old adage that a penny saved is a penny earned. The printing and distribution of the President's budget to 435 House offices is excessive. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and we will save precious taxpayer money and prevent future mass deliveries. Again, all these publications are online in their entirely, where they are more easily searchable, and they are also on a free mobile app. I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their work on this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Grayson The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 114-611. [[Page H3685]] Mr. GRAYSON. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to enter into a contract with any offeror or any of its principals if the offeror certifies, as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation, that the offeror or any of its principals-- (1) within a three-year period preceding the offer, has been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against it for commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (2) are presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated above in paragraph (1); or (3) within a three-year period preceding the offer, has been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. GRAYSON. Madam Chair, this is an amendment that is identical to other amendments that have been inserted by voice vote into every appropriations bill considered under an open rule during the 113th and 114th Congresses. I extend my thanks to the Rules Committee for ruling this amendment in order. My amendment expands the list of parties with whom the Federal Government is prohibited from contracting due to serious misconduct on the part of the contractors. I hope that this amendment remains noncontroversial, as it has been, and will again be passed unanimously by the House. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz). Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment. This is a commonsense amendment which would prohibit funding in this bill from being used to pay contractors engaged in fraud or tax evasion. As the gentleman said, similar amendments have been adopted on other appropriations bills. I urge Members to vote ``aye.'' Mr. GRAYSON. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Takano The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. There is appropriated, for salaries and expenses of the Office of Technology Assessment as authorized by the Technology Assessment Act of 1972 (2 U.S.C. 471 et seq.) $2,500,000, to be derived from a reduction of $2,500,000 in the amount provided in this Act for the item for ``Architect of the Capitol, Capital Construction and Operations''. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of my amendment, which would restore funding to the Office of Technology Assessment, or OTA. The foundation for good policy is accurate and objective analysis; and for more than two decades, the OTA set that foundation by providing relevant, unbiased technical and scientific assessments for Members of Congress and staff. In 1995, the OTA was defunded, stripping Congress of a valuable resource to understand both emerging technologies as well as the nuances of the legislative process. In its absence, the need for OTA has only grown. Many of the issues OTA studied 20 years ago are even more pressing today: antibiotic-resistant bacteria, electronic surveillance in the digital age, and testing in America's schools. These are the complex challenges our Nation will continue to face, and Congress should have access to the thorough and insightful analysis OTA can provide. Investing in the OTA now will actually save us money in the future. In the last year it operated, OTA's budget was $23 million, but its studies on the Synthetics Fuels Corporation saved taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. Our amendment restores a modest $2.5 million to the OTA account for salaries and expenses to begin rebuilding the office. The cost is offset by a reduction of the same amount to the AOC's capital construction and operations account, which is an administrative account. So this will not take resources from specific construction projects. Madam Chair, a great surgeon does not operate without modern tools, a master chef does not cook without fresh ingredients, and Members of Congress should not make policy decisions without relevant and unbiased information. I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on this amendment to restore funding to the Office of Technology Assessment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I want to thank the gentleman from California. I know he has great intentions with this amendment. As we discuss the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, we are really discussing what is important to the House of Representatives, because that is what this bill reflects. I know that this office was created in 1972 and was eliminated years later, but in 1972, I was 2 years old. Technology was very different. I see no need to re-create something that was started dealing with technology when I was 2 years old, almost two decades prior to the first Web site. Currently, these tasks are being handled by GAO. They are being handled sufficiently. They are being handled with the $2.5 million already, and we have yet to receive any complaints. Now, if there is a more comprehensive need for technology assessment, I think that is a bigger discussion for cyber policy in general, and that is a conversation that should take place outside of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee's jurisdiction. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz). Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I rise in support of the amendment to revive the Office of Technology Assessment. When I was chair of the subcommittee, we tried to restart it within the Government Accountability Office. In fiscal years 2008 to 2010, I included $2.5 million in this bill with GAO to support that initiative. However, the supporters of the amendment make an impassioned case that the Office of Technology Assessment should be a part of Congress itself, rather than GAO, in order to provide objective analysis of complex, scientific, and technical issues which certainly, I think we can all agree, actually exist today. We are not trying to go back to 20th century technology. We have important issues that need to be reviewed, and we don't always have the expertise in Congress necessary to be able to make sure we can get that cogent analysis, particularly when we are still at funding levels back to 2010 in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. This is a bill in which we are tackling copyright modernization, specifically dealing with technology challenges, and an OTA would add to the rigor of our analysis on that topic and others. I urge support of the amendment. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I will just point out that one of our focuses in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill is to be very responsible with taxpayer dollars. During these lean times when we are $19 trillion in debt, we have really led the [[Page H3686]] charge when it comes to reducing spending from our operations, down 13.2 percent. We have eliminated some agencies and programs and even, in this bill, eliminate the Open World Center. {time} 1130 I don't see this as the time that we need to restart a new program that was eliminated 20 years ago. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, how much time is remaining on my side? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), a member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and a respected physicist. Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, thank you to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) and to my colleagues, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) and the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan) for helping to bring this amendment to the floor. This amendment would provide $2.5 million to resurrect the Office of Technology Assessment to revive this crucial service of providing Congress with unbiased, nonpartisan reports on a wide range of issues in science and technology. This office is no less necessary today than when it first started in 1972. As technology continues to advance at an increasingly rapid pace and our partisan divide seems to grow deeper, Congress needs this now more than ever. I ask my colleagues to consider just one single one of the recommendations from the Office of Technology Assessment, that the United States rapidly adopt a standardized electronic medical record format. Had this been done, we would have been able to save hundreds of millions of dollars in medical costs over the last decades and hundreds of thousands of lives of Americans through prevention of preventable medical accidents. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to restore this vital source of credible and nonpartisan scientific expertise in Congress. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I reiterate my support for the Office of Technology Assessment. Congress does not suffer from a lack of information, but it suffers from a lack of trusted information to help make wise policy decisions. We need information that is not spun even by our own agencies, the FBI or other agencies. We need information that is not spun from particular sectors. This agency, this Office of Technology Assessment, will be overseen by a bipartisan group of lawmakers who will vet the experts that work for it. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I will just again thank my colleague from California for his thoughtful and well-debated argument here for the need, as he sees it. I will again reiterate that the GAO provides a valuable service which I believe can continue doing the job that is necessary. In these lean times, I would encourage our colleagues to oppose this amendment not because of the gentleman from California, but just because of the lean times and the concept in which it is just not the right time to adopt that. I will oppose the amendment. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Russell The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the Federal Register to a Member of the House of Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress) unless the Member requests a copy. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Chair, the fiscal year 2017 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act contains several excellent provisions to cut down on unnecessary printing of paper documents in the House of Representatives. Section 102 of the act, for example, prohibits printed copies of bills from being sent to Members of Congress unless they specifically request them. This amendment is very similar. It prohibits the Federal Register from being sent to Members unless they specifically request it. It uses the exact same terminology as section 102. The Federal Register, while important because it contains rules, proposals, and various other publications released by Federal agencies, unfortunately every business day Members of Congress receive paper copies of this Register, while it is available online and queryable. Sadly, most of these hundreds of pages in length end up in the waste bin. The Federal Register, being available online, is a better way to go with this measure. The Government Printing Office sends 617 copies of the Register every single day to House Members alone. This includes subscriptions for personal offices, committees, archival offices, and others. Each annual subscription costs the Government Printing Office $750 a year to produce in paper and ink alone. These costs are charged to Federal agencies that publish in the Federal Register. Among all the Members of Congress and six nonvoting Members in the House, paying for an annual subscription for all of these costs and other estimated delivery costs exceeds $400,000 annually. To put that into perspective, that could pay for the annual salaries of a dozen Special Forces sergeants who are defending our country abroad. None of the funds made available by this act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the Federal Register to a Member of the House of Representatives, including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to Congress, unless the Members request specifically a copy. This simple amendment will build on the reforms of the congressional printing of sections 102, 103, and 105, allowing Federal agencies to better use precious taxpayer dollars. I encourage support for this amendment, Madam Chair, because, once again, we will never win the war on our national debt in some giant spending measure that will only divide us within our respective parties and within the Chamber. Instead, we will win it by combating waste one agency at a time. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Pearce The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $190,970)''. Page 5, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $190,970)''. Page 6, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $190,970)''. Page 42, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert ``(increased by $190,970)''. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico. Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. [[Page H3687]] Madam Chair, despite what has been said about this amendment, it is very simple. There are two bodies that are funded through the appropriations process in the U.S. Congress. One is the House Committee on Ethics. That is the one that we all know as Members of Congress. But there is another body called the Office of Congressional Ethics that works pretty well outside of this body. Now, my amendment is simply taking this year's increase away from that outside body. Again, no change to the ethical process inside the body, the one that we are all familiar with and feel accountable to. But we are deducting $191,000 from this outside group because in this time of budget constraints, when I look at my office and all the other offices, our spending has been reduced. Our budgets have been reduced by approximately $200,000 since 2008. Now, we have to deal with 750,000 to 900,000 constituents. I have five field offices. Generally we drive, as a staff, somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 miles per year to deal with our constituents. Our budgets have gone down $200,000, with a small increase this year of $12,000. Then, on the other hand, I see a $191,000 increase on this outside group. I just feel like that is extraordinary and would suggest that the appropriations bill, H.R. 5325, be reduced in that amount in this budget area. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, the Office of Congressional Ethics is crucial to ensuring accountability and transparency in this body. Any attempts to cut its budget would only serve to erode our constituents' trust and faith in Congress, which certainly has already suffered a significant amount of erosion. As many of my colleagues will recall, the House created the Office of Congressional Ethics nearly a decade ago to improve the integrity of the ethics process in the House. The House was recovering from the Mark Foley scandal, and it was clear that we needed to do something to rebuild the American people's trust in their elected Representatives. That is why OCE's core ``mission is to assist the U.S. House in upholding high ethical standards with an eye toward increasing transparency and providing information to the public.'' I acknowledge that there are proposals to improve the operations of the Office of Congressional Ethics, and we should certainly take a look at those, Madam Chair, but it is common sense that these improvements can't be made by cutting funding for the office that we are actually seeking to improve. Moreover, the issue of congressional ethics is far too important to reduce to a 10-minute debate on the House floor. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided amendment. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chair, I find it odd that we received the words today on the House floor that we are going to increase transparency through the Office of Congressional Ethics. That is exactly what they do not do. The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution gives the accused the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. I will quote from a letter, a legal letter that was given to the OCE: This investigation has again revealed due process deficiencies within the OCE rules. While the Sixth Amendment of the United States provides for the fundamental right to confront one's accusers, the OCE rules do not allow to confront the accused with the accusers. Secondly, the Sixth Amendment gives us the right to a lawyer. I will again quote from Paul Solis, an employee of the OCE, in an email to my chief of staff: I forgot to mention on our call that should you retain a lawyer for the office, that lawyer would most likely be prohibited under our rules from representing a subject of this review to the extent that subject is a current staff member. So the OCE, in their email to our office, says you don't have the right to legal counsel, even though the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution says that you do. The third thing that I see is that we should be able to find out the nature of the charges under the Sixth Amendment. Again, our experience and the experience of others who have confronted OCE realizes you do not know what the charges are, you are not going to get to get a lawyer, and you cannot know who is accusing you. This hardly meets the word ``transparency'' that my good friend alluded to. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, while I can appreciate the gentleman's concerns, he has listed a number of substantive differences of opinion with the way the Office of Congressional Ethics handles their work. This appropriations bill is not the appropriate place to address those. The Office of Congressional Ethics was created through legislation. It is a substantive issue, and it is one that should be debated and discussed on an authorizing bill, not on the funding of the legislative branch. You don't just cut the budget of an office with whose decisions you disagree. We can debate and discuss these concerns, but cutting $190,000 out of the OCE's budget is not the way to address that. For those reasons and the fact that the public already has some pretty significant concerns with the way we do business here, this would send the wrong message. If we are going to have this discussion, we should do it in a forum that allows for more robust discussion and debate over how to address those challenges long term. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1145 Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chair, I would remind my friend and colleague that this amendment only addresses the funding. I simply used my time in order to advertise for this agency and the way that they operate. I would like to quote from an email that I got this morning: I cried when I saw what your boss did last night on the Leg Branch. This is referring to my amendment. I was unfairly targeted by OCE in 2013, for an action in 2008, which had been approved by the Ethics Committee. OCE even admitted there was no evidence. I complied with every provision of the policy, without exception. One of the staffers that was being investigated in this same circumstance left the Hill early on. I considered doing the same thing. I certainly had to endure all the phases of the OCE process, including referral to the Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee dismissed the case against us, but it is, by far, the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my 21 years on the Hill. I am a strong person with resources, and was an emotional wreck over the thought of losing my credibility over an ethics investigation. I cried virtually every day for several months. And the prolonged process over many, many months took a toll on my life. And we are asking to give this agency another $191,000 to continue this kind of action? I think this debate is exactly called for at this moment on this bill and on this spending. Madam Chair, I urge Members to support the amendment to give notice to the OCE that we are watching what they are doing. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida has 3 minutes remaining. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I have tremendous respect for the gentleman from New Mexico and his concerns for the operation of the Office of Congressional Ethics. However, all that we would be doing here, if his amendment were to pass, is to send a $190,000 message to the Office of Congressional Ethics. It would not achieve any of the gentleman's goals. If we do need to take a look at the way the office functions, then there is a process for doing that. The only thing we achieve here by adopting this amendment is cutting their budget by $190,000. So, if the majority believes that it is important to take a look at the function of this office, then there is a process for doing that and to take up legislation to change the way they do business. That is certainly appropriate. But we don't accomplish any of the gentleman's goals by cutting $190,000. [[Page H3688]] In fact, the public has certainly already sent multiple messages to the United States Congress that they don't have a whole lot of confidence in the business that we are doing here. This would send the absolute wrong message back to them--that we don't get it. So I urge Members to oppose the amendment because it would not achieve the gentleman's goals and because we have a more appropriate place to actually achieve those goals in the authorizing committee. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR.

Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren) having assumed the chair, Ms. Foxx, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5325) making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 771, she reported the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The amendments were agreed to. [[Page H3691]] The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. CASTRO of Texas. I am opposed to it in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Castro of Texas moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5325 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: In the ``Capital Construction and Operations'' account, on page 17, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $200,000)''. In the ``Library of Congress--Salaries and Expenses'' account, on page 25, line 24, after the first dollar amount, insert ``(increased by $200,000)''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, before I speak on this amendment, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who has been a strong advocate and leader on this issue, for an opportunity to say a few words. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleague, Congressman Joaquin Castro, to urge the majority to finally allow the House to strike a destructive political provision that has made its way into the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. If those listening are wondering why we are talking about the pejorative term ``illegal aliens'' on the bill that funds the legislative branch, then you are not alone. This legislation's accompanying report includes language that would have the Library continue to use the term ``illegal aliens,'' ``to the extent practicable''--even though the Library itself has said that there is no practicable means to continue to use the term ``illegal aliens.'' The Library changes thousands of subject headings each year without interference from Congress. Why this one? Why now? The Library once used the subject heading ``Negro,'' then moved to ``Afro-American,'' and now ``African American.'' They didn't wait until the entire U.S. Code was free of the pejorative term ``Negro'' before they changed their subject heading. As a matter of fact, Congress only recently removed the last vestiges of the terms ``Negro'' and ``Oriental'' from the U.S. Code in May of 2016. That bill passed with a unanimous vote, including the ``yes'' vote of the chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. If we removed ``Negro'' and ``Oriental'' in the subject headings of the Library of Congress before we changed the U.S. Code, then we should do the same for the now-pejorative term, ``illegal alien.'' The Library of Congress is our Nation's first established cultural institution, and it is hard to fathom why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would try to tie its hands to the slow-moving wheels of the U.S. Code. Entering into an immigration debate on the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill is a terrible precedent. If the majority is really serious about debating the U.S. Code, then let's have the Republican Rules Committee bring up the Castro bill that would remove the hurtful and inaccurate term ``illegal aliens'' once and for all from the U.S. Code. We are Members of Congress, not captains of the word police. Free the card catalog and depoliticize this bill. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes and 35 seconds remaining. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in 1922, the only grandparent I would come to know came from Mexico to the United States. She was not a rapist or a murderer or an alien. She was a 6-year-old girl whose parents had died around the time of the Mexican Revolution, and the closest relatives who could take her and her sister in were in Texas. I bet if we went around this Chamber, I know there would be beautiful stories, similar stories, of ancestors who came from Italy, Germany, Ireland, Africa, Asia, and every corner of the world. They are the immigrants to this country. They are the strength of this country. Language matters. Recently, the Library of Congress decided to retire the term ``illegal alien'' because it is dehumanizing. For the first time in American history, today, the Congress is ready to interfere with the business of the Library of Congress. In the years of the Congress and the Library, language has evolved. That is why we have done away with terms like ``Negro,'' ``Oriental,'' ``lunatic,'' and ``retarded,'' because we understand that even words that start off as neutral descriptors can, over time, become used as verbal weapons and knives to inflict pain and disrespect and sow division. That is the case today. There are times in our country's history where our politics have also been a race to the bottom. Those Irish ancestors were greeted by signs that read ``no Irish need apply'' in cities like New York and Boston. The Japanese, German, and Italian Americans even were interned during World War II. Chinese were excluded from this country for decades. During the Eisenhower administration, many Hispanics in this country were rounded up and deported to Mexico even if they were American. {time} 1230 What I am asking is for us not to fuel the flames of this season and for us to take a better course and do the right thing. I am asking you to support this motion to recommit because the words ``illegal alien'' will be retired. This will change, whether it is now or 6 months from now or 10 years from now. The question for all of us is whether we, today, will do the right thing or whether a few years from now we apologize for doing the wrong thing. Please support this motion to recommit and do the right thing. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to make this quick because I want to make sure the House knows what offensive language is in this bill. It is so offensive that I am going to read it. To the extent practicable, the committee instructs the Library to maintain certain subject headings that reflect terminology used in title 8, United States Code. That is what is so offensive to the minority party. For 7\1/2\ years, we have had a President who wants to ignore the intent of the laws of our land. We will not allow this body, this House, to ignore the definitions nor the words of the laws that have been voted on in this body, passed by the Senate, and signed into law by the President. I am asking this body to vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit, vote ``yes'' to uphold the laws of this land, vote ``yes'' for your constituents on final passage, and have a good weekend. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the further consideration of H.R. 5325 and that I may include tabular material on the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 771 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 5325. Will the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) kindly take the chair. {time} 1114 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole [[Page H3684]] House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 5325) making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, with Ms. Foxx (Acting Chair) in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Thursday, June 9, 2016, the Chair had announced that it was in order to consider amendment No. 7, printed in House Report 114-611. {time} 1115 Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Gosar The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the United States House of Representatives Telephone Directory to the office of any Member of the House of Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress). The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment that will prevent wasteful spending in this bill and the unsolicited delivery of printed copies of the House telephone directory to 435 House congressional offices. I hold here the United States House of Representatives Telephone Directory for 2016. This book, printed by the Government Publishing Office, contains 378 pages of names, addresses, and the contact information for Members of Congress and their staffs. While the Clerk of the House does get a deal from the GPO on these printing costs, this directory is sold to the public online at a cost of $52 per book. GPO stated that 14,080 copies of this directory were sent this year to the House Postal Operations for delivery. This year, all 435 House Member offices received this stack--this whole stack right here--unsolicited from the Office of the Clerk, 20 copies, total, for each office. Each year we get this directory and, to be frank, it is not needed. All the information contained within these pages is readily available online, both publicly and through House Web sites. To make matters worse, often, the information contained is out of date by the time we receive these bound copies. For example, by the time I received my 20 copies of this directory, the information listed for my staff was no longer current. According to a CRS report from 2011, approximately 97 percent of all government documents originate in digital form and are distributed electronically but are not printed. This same CRS report estimated that it costs Congress about $134 per page for prepress costs for miscellaneous publications, of which this directory is one. Madam Chairman, I don't think I need to remind anyone here that we are currently $19 trillion-plus in debt as a result of excessive and unnecessary spending. I will be the first to admit that this amendment will not be saving millions of dollars this year alone, but in a time of such financial crisis, we should remain vigilant and save every penny we can. This book is unnecessary, and its unsolicited distribution en masse is excessive. Why does each D.C. office get 20 unsolicited copies? My D.C. office only has eight employees, none of which utilize these wasteful directories. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that will save precious taxpayer money and prevent future unsolicited deliveries of this directory in every single House office on the Hill. I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their work on this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Gosar The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the Budget of the United States Government; Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the United States Government; or the Appendix, Budget of the United States Government, to the office of any Member of the House of Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress). The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairman, I rise today to offer another commonsense amendment that will prevent wasteful spending in this bill by preventing the delivery of this packet of nearly 2,000 pages containing the President's budget request to 435 House congressional offices. In its 2017 budget justification, the Government Publishing Office states: ``Since 2012, GPO has made the annual Budget of the U.S. Government available as a mobile app. The FY 2016 Budget app, released in January of 2015, provided users with access to the text and images of the Budget, including the Budget Message of the President, information on the President's priorities, and budget overviews organized by agency. This app provides links to GPO's FDsys where summary tables and additional books of the Budget, including the Analytical Perspectives, Appendix, and Historical Tables, are available.'' This package, which contains the President's budget, analytical perspectives of the budget, and the appendix of the budget are all available on an app for your phone for free. Furthermore, all three are available in their entirety online at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ , where they are more easily searchable. While the Office of Management and Budget does get a great deal from GPO on printing costs, each individual copy sells online for $38, $56, and $79, respectively. These documents comprise 170 pages, 409 pages, and 1,413 pages, respectively. OMB orders one copy of the budget for all 435 Members of the House, and this publication is then printed by the Government Publishing Office and delivered by House Postal Operations. In a time when our Nation is facing a fiscal crisis and has a $19 trillion-plus debt as a result of excessive and unnecessary spending, we should not be squandering more money printing nearly 2,000 pages of the President's budget that most Members throw in the trash, recycle, or don't even open. Furthermore, this massive document is not even a serious proposal and has been routinely rejected with strong bipartisan support. The Senate defeated President Obama's budget by a vote of 97-0 for fiscal year 2011, 99-0 in fiscal year 2012, and 98-1 last year. Again, I will be the first one to admit that this amendment will not save millions of dollars this year alone, but, in a time of such fiscal crisis, we should remember the old adage that a penny saved is a penny earned. The printing and distribution of the President's budget to 435 House offices is excessive. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and we will save precious taxpayer money and prevent future mass deliveries. Again, all these publications are online in their entirely, where they are more easily searchable, and they are also on a free mobile app. I thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their work on this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Grayson The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 114-611. [[Page H3685]] Mr. GRAYSON. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to enter into a contract with any offeror or any of its principals if the offeror certifies, as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation, that the offeror or any of its principals-- (1) within a three-year period preceding the offer, has been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against it for commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (2) are presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated above in paragraph (1); or (3) within a three-year period preceding the offer, has been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. GRAYSON. Madam Chair, this is an amendment that is identical to other amendments that have been inserted by voice vote into every appropriations bill considered under an open rule during the 113th and 114th Congresses. I extend my thanks to the Rules Committee for ruling this amendment in order. My amendment expands the list of parties with whom the Federal Government is prohibited from contracting due to serious misconduct on the part of the contractors. I hope that this amendment remains noncontroversial, as it has been, and will again be passed unanimously by the House. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz). Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment. This is a commonsense amendment which would prohibit funding in this bill from being used to pay contractors engaged in fraud or tax evasion. As the gentleman said, similar amendments have been adopted on other appropriations bills. I urge Members to vote ``aye.'' Mr. GRAYSON. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Takano The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. There is appropriated, for salaries and expenses of the Office of Technology Assessment as authorized by the Technology Assessment Act of 1972 (2 U.S.C. 471 et seq.) $2,500,000, to be derived from a reduction of $2,500,000 in the amount provided in this Act for the item for ``Architect of the Capitol, Capital Construction and Operations''. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of my amendment, which would restore funding to the Office of Technology Assessment, or OTA. The foundation for good policy is accurate and objective analysis; and for more than two decades, the OTA set that foundation by providing relevant, unbiased technical and scientific assessments for Members of Congress and staff. In 1995, the OTA was defunded, stripping Congress of a valuable resource to understand both emerging technologies as well as the nuances of the legislative process. In its absence, the need for OTA has only grown. Many of the issues OTA studied 20 years ago are even more pressing today: antibiotic-resistant bacteria, electronic surveillance in the digital age, and testing in America's schools. These are the complex challenges our Nation will continue to face, and Congress should have access to the thorough and insightful analysis OTA can provide. Investing in the OTA now will actually save us money in the future. In the last year it operated, OTA's budget was $23 million, but its studies on the Synthetics Fuels Corporation saved taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. Our amendment restores a modest $2.5 million to the OTA account for salaries and expenses to begin rebuilding the office. The cost is offset by a reduction of the same amount to the AOC's capital construction and operations account, which is an administrative account. So this will not take resources from specific construction projects. Madam Chair, a great surgeon does not operate without modern tools, a master chef does not cook without fresh ingredients, and Members of Congress should not make policy decisions without relevant and unbiased information. I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on this amendment to restore funding to the Office of Technology Assessment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I want to thank the gentleman from California. I know he has great intentions with this amendment. As we discuss the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, we are really discussing what is important to the House of Representatives, because that is what this bill reflects. I know that this office was created in 1972 and was eliminated years later, but in 1972, I was 2 years old. Technology was very different. I see no need to re-create something that was started dealing with technology when I was 2 years old, almost two decades prior to the first Web site. Currently, these tasks are being handled by GAO. They are being handled sufficiently. They are being handled with the $2.5 million already, and we have yet to receive any complaints. Now, if there is a more comprehensive need for technology assessment, I think that is a bigger discussion for cyber policy in general, and that is a conversation that should take place outside of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee's jurisdiction. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz). Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I rise in support of the amendment to revive the Office of Technology Assessment. When I was chair of the subcommittee, we tried to restart it within the Government Accountability Office. In fiscal years 2008 to 2010, I included $2.5 million in this bill with GAO to support that initiative. However, the supporters of the amendment make an impassioned case that the Office of Technology Assessment should be a part of Congress itself, rather than GAO, in order to provide objective analysis of complex, scientific, and technical issues which certainly, I think we can all agree, actually exist today. We are not trying to go back to 20th century technology. We have important issues that need to be reviewed, and we don't always have the expertise in Congress necessary to be able to make sure we can get that cogent analysis, particularly when we are still at funding levels back to 2010 in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. This is a bill in which we are tackling copyright modernization, specifically dealing with technology challenges, and an OTA would add to the rigor of our analysis on that topic and others. I urge support of the amendment. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I will just point out that one of our focuses in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill is to be very responsible with taxpayer dollars. During these lean times when we are $19 trillion in debt, we have really led the [[Page H3686]] charge when it comes to reducing spending from our operations, down 13.2 percent. We have eliminated some agencies and programs and even, in this bill, eliminate the Open World Center. {time} 1130 I don't see this as the time that we need to restart a new program that was eliminated 20 years ago. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, how much time is remaining on my side? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), a member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and a respected physicist. Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, thank you to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) and to my colleagues, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) and the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan) for helping to bring this amendment to the floor. This amendment would provide $2.5 million to resurrect the Office of Technology Assessment to revive this crucial service of providing Congress with unbiased, nonpartisan reports on a wide range of issues in science and technology. This office is no less necessary today than when it first started in 1972. As technology continues to advance at an increasingly rapid pace and our partisan divide seems to grow deeper, Congress needs this now more than ever. I ask my colleagues to consider just one single one of the recommendations from the Office of Technology Assessment, that the United States rapidly adopt a standardized electronic medical record format. Had this been done, we would have been able to save hundreds of millions of dollars in medical costs over the last decades and hundreds of thousands of lives of Americans through prevention of preventable medical accidents. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to restore this vital source of credible and nonpartisan scientific expertise in Congress. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I reiterate my support for the Office of Technology Assessment. Congress does not suffer from a lack of information, but it suffers from a lack of trusted information to help make wise policy decisions. We need information that is not spun even by our own agencies, the FBI or other agencies. We need information that is not spun from particular sectors. This agency, this Office of Technology Assessment, will be overseen by a bipartisan group of lawmakers who will vet the experts that work for it. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Chair, I will just again thank my colleague from California for his thoughtful and well-debated argument here for the need, as he sees it. I will again reiterate that the GAO provides a valuable service which I believe can continue doing the job that is necessary. In these lean times, I would encourage our colleagues to oppose this amendment not because of the gentleman from California, but just because of the lean times and the concept in which it is just not the right time to adopt that. I will oppose the amendment. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Russell The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the Federal Register to a Member of the House of Representatives (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress) unless the Member requests a copy. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Chair, the fiscal year 2017 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act contains several excellent provisions to cut down on unnecessary printing of paper documents in the House of Representatives. Section 102 of the act, for example, prohibits printed copies of bills from being sent to Members of Congress unless they specifically request them. This amendment is very similar. It prohibits the Federal Register from being sent to Members unless they specifically request it. It uses the exact same terminology as section 102. The Federal Register, while important because it contains rules, proposals, and various other publications released by Federal agencies, unfortunately every business day Members of Congress receive paper copies of this Register, while it is available online and queryable. Sadly, most of these hundreds of pages in length end up in the waste bin. The Federal Register, being available online, is a better way to go with this measure. The Government Printing Office sends 617 copies of the Register every single day to House Members alone. This includes subscriptions for personal offices, committees, archival offices, and others. Each annual subscription costs the Government Printing Office $750 a year to produce in paper and ink alone. These costs are charged to Federal agencies that publish in the Federal Register. Among all the Members of Congress and six nonvoting Members in the House, paying for an annual subscription for all of these costs and other estimated delivery costs exceeds $400,000 annually. To put that into perspective, that could pay for the annual salaries of a dozen Special Forces sergeants who are defending our country abroad. None of the funds made available by this act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the Federal Register to a Member of the House of Representatives, including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to Congress, unless the Members request specifically a copy. This simple amendment will build on the reforms of the congressional printing of sections 102, 103, and 105, allowing Federal agencies to better use precious taxpayer dollars. I encourage support for this amendment, Madam Chair, because, once again, we will never win the war on our national debt in some giant spending measure that will only divide us within our respective parties and within the Chamber. Instead, we will win it by combating waste one agency at a time. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Pearce The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in House Report 114-611. Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $190,970)''. Page 5, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $190,970)''. Page 6, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $190,970)''. Page 42, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert ``(increased by $190,970)''. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 771, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico. Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. [[Page H3687]] Madam Chair, despite what has been said about this amendment, it is very simple. There are two bodies that are funded through the appropriations process in the U.S. Congress. One is the House Committee on Ethics. That is the one that we all know as Members of Congress. But there is another body called the Office of Congressional Ethics that works pretty well outside of this body. Now, my amendment is simply taking this year's increase away from that outside body. Again, no change to the ethical process inside the body, the one that we are all familiar with and feel accountable to. But we are deducting $191,000 from this outside group because in this time of budget constraints, when I look at my office and all the other offices, our spending has been reduced. Our budgets have been reduced by approximately $200,000 since 2008. Now, we have to deal with 750,000 to 900,000 constituents. I have five field offices. Generally we drive, as a staff, somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 miles per year to deal with our constituents. Our budgets have gone down $200,000, with a small increase this year of $12,000. Then, on the other hand, I see a $191,000 increase on this outside group. I just feel like that is extraordinary and would suggest that the appropriations bill, H.R. 5325, be reduced in that amount in this budget area. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, the Office of Congressional Ethics is crucial to ensuring accountability and transparency in this body. Any attempts to cut its budget would only serve to erode our constituents' trust and faith in Congress, which certainly has already suffered a significant amount of erosion. As many of my colleagues will recall, the House created the Office of Congressional Ethics nearly a decade ago to improve the integrity of the ethics process in the House. The House was recovering from the Mark Foley scandal, and it was clear that we needed to do something to rebuild the American people's trust in their elected Representatives. That is why OCE's core ``mission is to assist the U.S. House in upholding high ethical standards with an eye toward increasing transparency and providing information to the public.'' I acknowledge that there are proposals to improve the operations of the Office of Congressional Ethics, and we should certainly take a look at those, Madam Chair, but it is common sense that these improvements can't be made by cutting funding for the office that we are actually seeking to improve. Moreover, the issue of congressional ethics is far too important to reduce to a 10-minute debate on the House floor. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided amendment. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chair, I find it odd that we received the words today on the House floor that we are going to increase transparency through the Office of Congressional Ethics. That is exactly what they do not do. The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution gives the accused the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. I will quote from a letter, a legal letter that was given to the OCE: This investigation has again revealed due process deficiencies within the OCE rules. While the Sixth Amendment of the United States provides for the fundamental right to confront one's accusers, the OCE rules do not allow to confront the accused with the accusers. Secondly, the Sixth Amendment gives us the right to a lawyer. I will again quote from Paul Solis, an employee of the OCE, in an email to my chief of staff: I forgot to mention on our call that should you retain a lawyer for the office, that lawyer would most likely be prohibited under our rules from representing a subject of this review to the extent that subject is a current staff member. So the OCE, in their email to our office, says you don't have the right to legal counsel, even though the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution says that you do. The third thing that I see is that we should be able to find out the nature of the charges under the Sixth Amendment. Again, our experience and the experience of others who have confronted OCE realizes you do not know what the charges are, you are not going to get to get a lawyer, and you cannot know who is accusing you. This hardly meets the word ``transparency'' that my good friend alluded to. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, while I can appreciate the gentleman's concerns, he has listed a number of substantive differences of opinion with the way the Office of Congressional Ethics handles their work. This appropriations bill is not the appropriate place to address those. The Office of Congressional Ethics was created through legislation. It is a substantive issue, and it is one that should be debated and discussed on an authorizing bill, not on the funding of the legislative branch. You don't just cut the budget of an office with whose decisions you disagree. We can debate and discuss these concerns, but cutting $190,000 out of the OCE's budget is not the way to address that. For those reasons and the fact that the public already has some pretty significant concerns with the way we do business here, this would send the wrong message. If we are going to have this discussion, we should do it in a forum that allows for more robust discussion and debate over how to address those challenges long term. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1145 Mr. PEARCE. Madam Chair, I would remind my friend and colleague that this amendment only addresses the funding. I simply used my time in order to advertise for this agency and the way that they operate. I would like to quote from an email that I got this morning: I cried when I saw what your boss did last night on the Leg Branch. This is referring to my amendment. I was unfairly targeted by OCE in 2013, for an action in 2008, which had been approved by the Ethics Committee. OCE even admitted there was no evidence. I complied with every provision of the policy, without exception. One of the staffers that was being investigated in this same circumstance left the Hill early on. I considered doing the same thing. I certainly had to endure all the phases of the OCE process, including referral to the Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee dismissed the case against us, but it is, by far, the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my 21 years on the Hill. I am a strong person with resources, and was an emotional wreck over the thought of losing my credibility over an ethics investigation. I cried virtually every day for several months. And the prolonged process over many, many months took a toll on my life. And we are asking to give this agency another $191,000 to continue this kind of action? I think this debate is exactly called for at this moment on this bill and on this spending. Madam Chair, I urge Members to support the amendment to give notice to the OCE that we are watching what they are doing. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida has 3 minutes remaining. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Chair, I have tremendous respect for the gentleman from New Mexico and his concerns for the operation of the Office of Congressional Ethics. However, all that we would be doing here, if his amendment were to pass, is to send a $190,000 message to the Office of Congressional Ethics. It would not achieve any of the gentleman's goals. If we do need to take a look at the way the office functions, then there is a process for doing that. The only thing we achieve here by adopting this amendment is cutting their budget by $190,000. So, if the majority believes that it is important to take a look at the function of this office, then there is a process for doing that and to take up legislation to change the way they do business. That is certainly appropriate. But we don't accomplish any of the gentleman's goals by cutting $190,000. [[Page H3688]] In fact, the public has certainly already sent multiple messages to the United States Congress that they don't have a whole lot of confidence in the business that we are doing here. This would send the absolute wrong message back to them--that we don't get it. So I urge Members to oppose the amendment because it would not achieve the gentleman's goals and because we have a more appropriate place to actually achieve those goals in the authorizing committee. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).

Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren) having assumed the chair, Ms. Foxx, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5325) making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 771, she reported the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The amendments were agreed to. [[Page H3691]] The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. CASTRO of Texas. I am opposed to it in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Castro of Texas moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5325 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: In the ``Capital Construction and Operations'' account, on page 17, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $200,000)''. In the ``Library of Congress--Salaries and Expenses'' account, on page 25, line 24, after the first dollar amount, insert ``(increased by $200,000)''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, before I speak on this amendment, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who has been a strong advocate and leader on this issue, for an opportunity to say a few words. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleague, Congressman Joaquin Castro, to urge the majority to finally allow the House to strike a destructive political provision that has made its way into the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. If those listening are wondering why we are talking about the pejorative term ``illegal aliens'' on the bill that funds the legislative branch, then you are not alone. This legislation's accompanying report includes language that would have the Library continue to use the term ``illegal aliens,'' ``to the extent practicable''--even though the Library itself has said that there is no practicable means to continue to use the term ``illegal aliens.'' The Library changes thousands of subject headings each year without interference from Congress. Why this one? Why now? The Library once used the subject heading ``Negro,'' then moved to ``Afro-American,'' and now ``African American.'' They didn't wait until the entire U.S. Code was free of the pejorative term ``Negro'' before they changed their subject heading. As a matter of fact, Congress only recently removed the last vestiges of the terms ``Negro'' and ``Oriental'' from the U.S. Code in May of 2016. That bill passed with a unanimous vote, including the ``yes'' vote of the chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. If we removed ``Negro'' and ``Oriental'' in the subject headings of the Library of Congress before we changed the U.S. Code, then we should do the same for the now-pejorative term, ``illegal alien.'' The Library of Congress is our Nation's first established cultural institution, and it is hard to fathom why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would try to tie its hands to the slow-moving wheels of the U.S. Code. Entering into an immigration debate on the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill is a terrible precedent. If the majority is really serious about debating the U.S. Code, then let's have the Republican Rules Committee bring up the Castro bill that would remove the hurtful and inaccurate term ``illegal aliens'' once and for all from the U.S. Code. We are Members of Congress, not captains of the word police. Free the card catalog and depoliticize this bill. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes and 35 seconds remaining. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in 1922, the only grandparent I would come to know came from Mexico to the United States. She was not a rapist or a murderer or an alien. She was a 6-year-old girl whose parents had died around the time of the Mexican Revolution, and the closest relatives who could take her and her sister in were in Texas. I bet if we went around this Chamber, I know there would be beautiful stories, similar stories, of ancestors who came from Italy, Germany, Ireland, Africa, Asia, and every corner of the world. They are the immigrants to this country. They are the strength of this country. Language matters. Recently, the Library of Congress decided to retire the term ``illegal alien'' because it is dehumanizing. For the first time in American history, today, the Congress is ready to interfere with the business of the Library of Congress. In the years of the Congress and the Library, language has evolved. That is why we have done away with terms like ``Negro,'' ``Oriental,'' ``lunatic,'' and ``retarded,'' because we understand that even words that start off as neutral descriptors can, over time, become used as verbal weapons and knives to inflict pain and disrespect and sow division. That is the case today. There are times in our country's history where our politics have also been a race to the bottom. Those Irish ancestors were greeted by signs that read ``no Irish need apply'' in cities like New York and Boston. The Japanese, German, and Italian Americans even were interned during World War II. Chinese were excluded from this country for decades. During the Eisenhower administration, many Hispanics in this country were rounded up and deported to Mexico even if they were American. {time} 1230 What I am asking is for us not to fuel the flames of this season and for us to take a better course and do the right thing. I am asking you to support this motion to recommit because the words ``illegal alien'' will be retired. This will change, whether it is now or 6 months from now or 10 years from now. The question for all of us is whether we, today, will do the right thing or whether a few years from now we apologize for doing the wrong thing. Please support this motion to recommit and do the right thing. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to make this quick because I want to make sure the House knows what offensive language is in this bill. It is so offensive that I am going to read it. To the extent practicable, the committee instructs the Library to maintain certain subject headings that reflect terminology used in title 8, United States Code. That is what is so offensive to the minority party. For 7\1/2\ years, we have had a President who wants to ignore the intent of the laws of our land. We will not allow this body, this House, to ignore the definitions nor the words of the laws that have been voted on in this body, passed by the Senate, and signed into law by the President. I am asking this body to vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit, vote ``yes'' to uphold the laws of this land, vote ``yes'' for your constituents on final passage, and have a good weekend. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Recorded Vote Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5- minute votes on passage of the bill, adoption of House Concurrent Resolution 89, and adoption of House Concurrent Resolution 112. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 170, noes 237, not voting 27, as follows: [[Page H3692]] [Roll No. 293] AYES--170 Aguilar Ashford Bass Beatty Becerra Bera Beyer Bishop (GA) Blumenauer Bonamici Boyle, Brendan F.

there was no objection. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 771 and rule xviii, the chair declares the house in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for the further consideration of the bill, h.r. 5325. will the gentlewoman from north carolina (ms. foxx) kindly take the chair. {time} 1114 in the committee of the whole accordingly, the house resolved itself into the committee of the whole [[page h3684]] house on the state of the union for the further consideration of the bill (h.r. 5325) making appropriations for the legislative branch for the fiscal year ending september 30, 2017, and for other purposes, with ms. foxx (acting chair) in the chair. the clerk read the title of the bill. the acting chair. when the committee of the whole rose on thursday, june 9, 2016, the chair had announced that it was in order to consider amendment no. 7, printed in house report 114-611. {time} 1115 amendment no. 8 offered by mr. gosar the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 8 printed in house report 114-611. mr. gosar. madam chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: sec. __. none of the funds made available by this act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the united states house of representatives telephone directory to the office of any member of the house of representatives (including a delegate or resident commissioner to the congress). the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 771, the gentleman from arizona (mr. gosar) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from arizona. mr. gosar. madam chairman, i rise today to offer a commonsense amendment that will prevent wasteful spending in this bill and the unsolicited delivery of printed copies of the house telephone directory to 435 house congressional offices. i hold here the united states house of representatives telephone directory for 2016. this book, printed by the government publishing office, contains 378 pages of names, addresses, and the contact information for members of congress and their staffs. while the clerk of the house does get a deal from the gpo on these printing costs, this directory is sold to the public online at a cost of $52 per book. gpo stated that 14,080 copies of this directory were sent this year to the house postal operations for delivery. this year, all 435 house member offices received this stack--this whole stack right here--unsolicited from the office of the clerk, 20 copies, total, for each office. each year we get this directory and, to be frank, it is not needed. all the information contained within these pages is readily available online, both publicly and through house web sites. to make matters worse, often, the information contained is out of date by the time we receive these bound copies. for example, by the time i received my 20 copies of this directory, the information listed for my staff was no longer current. according to a crs report from 2011, approximately 97 percent of all government documents originate in digital form and are distributed electronically but are not printed. this same crs report estimated that it costs congress about $134 per page for prepress costs for miscellaneous publications, of which this directory is one. madam chairman, i don't think i need to remind anyone here that we are currently $19 trillion-plus in debt as a result of excessive and unnecessary spending. i will be the first to admit that this amendment will not be saving millions of dollars this year alone, but in a time of such financial crisis, we should remain vigilant and save every penny we can. this book is unnecessary, and its unsolicited distribution en masse is excessive. why does each d.c. office get 20 unsolicited copies? my d.c. office only has eight employees, none of which utilize these wasteful directories. i ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that will save precious taxpayer money and prevent future unsolicited deliveries of this directory in every single house office on the hill. i thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their work on this bill. i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona (mr. gosar). the amendment was agreed to. amendment no. 9 offered by mr. gosar the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 9 printed in house report 114-611. mr. gosar. madam chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: sec. __. none of the funds made available by this act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the budget of the united states government; analytical perspectives, budget of the united states government; or the appendix, budget of the united states government, to the office of any member of the house of representatives (including a delegate or resident commissioner to the congress). the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 771, the gentleman from arizona (mr. gosar) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from arizona. mr. gosar. madam chairman, i rise today to offer another commonsense amendment that will prevent wasteful spending in this bill by preventing the delivery of this packet of nearly 2,000 pages containing the president's budget request to 435 house congressional offices. in its 2017 budget justification, the government publishing office states: ``since 2012, gpo has made the annual budget of the u.s. government available as a mobile app. the fy 2016 budget app, released in january of 2015, provided users with access to the text and images of the budget, including the budget message of the president, information on the president's priorities, and budget overviews organized by agency. this app provides links to gpo's fdsys where summary tables and additional books of the budget, including the analytical perspectives, appendix, and historical tables, are available.'' this package, which contains the president's budget, analytical perspectives of the budget, and the appendix of the budget are all available on an app for your phone for free. furthermore, all three are available in their entirety online at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ , where they are more easily searchable. while the office of management and budget does get a great deal from gpo on printing costs, each individual copy sells online for $38, $56, and $79, respectively. these documents comprise 170 pages, 409 pages, and 1,413 pages, respectively. omb orders one copy of the budget for all 435 members of the house, and this publication is then printed by the government publishing office and delivered by house postal operations. in a time when our nation is facing a fiscal crisis and has a $19 trillion-plus debt as a result of excessive and unnecessary spending, we should not be squandering more money printing nearly 2,000 pages of the president's budget that most members throw in the trash, recycle, or don't even open. furthermore, this massive document is not even a serious proposal and has been routinely rejected with strong bipartisan support. the senate defeated president obama's budget by a vote of 97-0 for fiscal year 2011, 99-0 in fiscal year 2012, and 98-1 last year. again, i will be the first one to admit that this amendment will not save millions of dollars this year alone, but, in a time of such fiscal crisis, we should remember the old adage that a penny saved is a penny earned. the printing and distribution of the president's budget to 435 house offices is excessive. i ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and we will save precious taxpayer money and prevent future mass deliveries. again, all these publications are online in their entirely, where they are more easily searchable, and they are also on a free mobile app. i thank the distinguished chair and ranking member for their work on this bill. i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona (mr. gosar). the amendment was agreed to. amendment no. 10 offered by mr. grayson the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 10 printed in house report 114-611. [[page h3685]] mr. grayson. madam chair, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: sec. __. none of the funds made available by this act may be used to enter into a contract with any offeror or any of its principals if the offeror certifies, as required by federal acquisition regulation, that the offeror or any of its principals-- (1) within a three-year period preceding the offer, has been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against it for commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (2) are presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated above in paragraph (1); or (3) within a three-year period preceding the offer, has been notified of any delinquent federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 771, the gentleman from florida (mr. grayson) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from florida. mr. grayson. madam chair, this is an amendment that is identical to other amendments that have been inserted by voice vote into every appropriations bill considered under an open rule during the 113th and 114th congresses. i extend my thanks to the rules committee for ruling this amendment in order. my amendment expands the list of parties with whom the federal government is prohibited from contracting due to serious misconduct on the part of the contractors. i hope that this amendment remains noncontroversial, as it has been, and will again be passed unanimously by the house. i yield to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. wasserman schultz). ms. wasserman schultz. madam chair, i support the gentleman's amendment. this is a commonsense amendment which would prohibit funding in this bill from being used to pay contractors engaged in fraud or tax evasion. as the gentleman said, similar amendments have been adopted on other appropriations bills. i urge members to vote ``aye.'' mr. grayson. madam chair, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from florida (mr. grayson). the amendment was agreed to. amendment no. 11 offered by mr. takano the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 11 printed in house report 114-611. mr. takano. madam chair, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: sec. __. there is appropriated, for salaries and expenses of the office of technology assessment as authorized by the technology assessment act of 1972 (2 u.s.c. 471 et seq.) $2,500,000, to be derived from a reduction of $2,500,000 in the amount provided in this act for the item for ``architect of the capitol, capital construction and operations''. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 771, the gentleman from california (mr. takano) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. mr. takano. madam chair, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise today in support of my amendment, which would restore funding to the office of technology assessment, or ota. the foundation for good policy is accurate and objective analysis; and for more than two decades, the ota set that foundation by providing relevant, unbiased technical and scientific assessments for members of congress and staff. in 1995, the ota was defunded, stripping congress of a valuable resource to understand both emerging technologies as well as the nuances of the legislative process. in its absence, the need for ota has only grown. many of the issues ota studied 20 years ago are even more pressing today: antibiotic-resistant bacteria, electronic surveillance in the digital age, and testing in america's schools. these are the complex challenges our nation will continue to face, and congress should have access to the thorough and insightful analysis ota can provide. investing in the ota now will actually save us money in the future. in the last year it operated, ota's budget was $23 million, but its studies on the synthetics fuels corporation saved taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. our amendment restores a modest $2.5 million to the ota account for salaries and expenses to begin rebuilding the office. the cost is offset by a reduction of the same amount to the aoc's capital construction and operations account, which is an administrative account. so this will not take resources from specific construction projects. madam chair, a great surgeon does not operate without modern tools, a master chef does not cook without fresh ingredients, and members of congress should not make policy decisions without relevant and unbiased information. i urge members to vote ``yes'' on this amendment to restore funding to the office of technology assessment. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. graves of georgia. madam chair, i rise in opposition. the acting chair. the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. graves of georgia. madam chair, i want to thank the gentleman from california. i know he has great intentions with this amendment. as we discuss the legislative branch appropriations bill, we are really discussing what is important to the house of representatives, because that is what this bill reflects. i know that this office was created in 1972 and was eliminated years later, but in 1972, i was 2 years old. technology was very different. i see no need to re-create something that was started dealing with technology when i was 2 years old, almost two decades prior to the first web site. currently, these tasks are being handled by gao. they are being handled sufficiently. they are being handled with the $2.5 million already, and we have yet to receive any complaints. now, if there is a more comprehensive need for technology assessment, i think that is a bigger discussion for cyber policy in general, and that is a conversation that should take place outside of the legislative branch subcommittee's jurisdiction. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. takano. madam chair, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. wasserman schultz). ms. wasserman schultz. i rise in support of the amendment to revive the office of technology assessment. when i was chair of the subcommittee, we tried to restart it within the government accountability office. in fiscal years 2008 to 2010, i included $2.5 million in this bill with gao to support that initiative. however, the supporters of the amendment make an impassioned case that the office of technology assessment should be a part of congress itself, rather than gao, in order to provide objective analysis of complex, scientific, and technical issues which certainly, i think we can all agree, actually exist today. we are not trying to go back to 20th century technology. we have important issues that need to be reviewed, and we don't always have the expertise in congress necessary to be able to make sure we can get that cogent analysis, particularly when we are still at funding levels back to 2010 in the legislative branch appropriations bill. this is a bill in which we are tackling copyright modernization, specifically dealing with technology challenges, and an ota would add to the rigor of our analysis on that topic and others. i urge support of the amendment. mr. graves of georgia. madam chair, i will just point out that one of our focuses in the legislative branch appropriations bill is to be very responsible with taxpayer dollars. during these lean times when we are $19 trillion in debt, we have really led the [[page h3686]] charge when it comes to reducing spending from our operations, down 13.2 percent. we have eliminated some agencies and programs and even, in this bill, eliminate the open world center. {time} 1130 i don't see this as the time that we need to restart a new program that was eliminated 20 years ago. madam chair, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. takano. madam chair, how much time is remaining on my side? the acting chair. the gentleman from california has 2 minutes remaining. mr. takano. madam chair, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. foster), a member of the committee on science, space, and technology and a respected physicist. mr. foster. madam chair, thank you to the gentleman from california (mr. takano) and to my colleagues, the gentlewoman from connecticut (ms. esty) and the gentleman from new mexico (mr. ben ray lujan) for helping to bring this amendment to the floor. this amendment would provide $2.5 million to resurrect the office of technology assessment to revive this crucial service of providing congress with unbiased, nonpartisan reports on a wide range of issues in science and technology. this office is no less necessary today than when it first started in 1972. as technology continues to advance at an increasingly rapid pace and our partisan divide seems to grow deeper, congress needs this now more than ever. i ask my colleagues to consider just one single one of the recommendations from the office of technology assessment, that the united states rapidly adopt a standardized electronic medical record format. had this been done, we would have been able to save hundreds of millions of dollars in medical costs over the last decades and hundreds of thousands of lives of americans through prevention of preventable medical accidents. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to restore this vital source of credible and nonpartisan scientific expertise in congress. mr. takano. madam chair, i reiterate my support for the office of technology assessment. congress does not suffer from a lack of information, but it suffers from a lack of trusted information to help make wise policy decisions. we need information that is not spun even by our own agencies, the fbi or other agencies. we need information that is not spun from particular sectors. this agency, this office of technology assessment, will be overseen by a bipartisan group of lawmakers who will vet the experts that work for it. madam chair, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. graves of georgia. madam chair, i will just again thank my colleague from california for his thoughtful and well-debated argument here for the need, as he sees it. i will again reiterate that the gao provides a valuable service which i believe can continue doing the job that is necessary. in these lean times, i would encourage our colleagues to oppose this amendment not because of the gentleman from california, but just because of the lean times and the concept in which it is just not the right time to adopt that. i will oppose the amendment. madam chair, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from california (mr. takano). the question was taken; and the acting chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. mr. takano. madam chair, i demand a recorded vote. the acting chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from california will be postponed. amendment no. 12 offered by mr. russell the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 12 printed in house report 114-611. mr. russell. madam chair, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following: sec. __. none of the funds made available by this act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the federal register to a member of the house of representatives (including a delegate or resident commissioner to the congress) unless the member requests a copy. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 771, the gentleman from oklahoma (mr. russell) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from oklahoma. mr. russell. madam chair, the fiscal year 2017 legislative branch appropriations act contains several excellent provisions to cut down on unnecessary printing of paper documents in the house of representatives. section 102 of the act, for example, prohibits printed copies of bills from being sent to members of congress unless they specifically request them. this amendment is very similar. it prohibits the federal register from being sent to members unless they specifically request it. it uses the exact same terminology as section 102. the federal register, while important because it contains rules, proposals, and various other publications released by federal agencies, unfortunately every business day members of congress receive paper copies of this register, while it is available online and queryable. sadly, most of these hundreds of pages in length end up in the waste bin. the federal register, being available online, is a better way to go with this measure. the government printing office sends 617 copies of the register every single day to house members alone. this includes subscriptions for personal offices, committees, archival offices, and others. each annual subscription costs the government printing office $750 a year to produce in paper and ink alone. these costs are charged to federal agencies that publish in the federal register. among all the members of congress and six nonvoting members in the house, paying for an annual subscription for all of these costs and other estimated delivery costs exceeds $400,000 annually. to put that into perspective, that could pay for the annual salaries of a dozen special forces sergeants who are defending our country abroad. none of the funds made available by this act may be used to deliver a printed copy of the federal register to a member of the house of representatives, including a delegate or resident commissioner to congress, unless the members request specifically a copy. this simple amendment will build on the reforms of the congressional printing of sections 102, 103, and 105, allowing federal agencies to better use precious taxpayer dollars. i encourage support for this amendment, madam chair, because, once again, we will never win the war on our national debt in some giant spending measure that will only divide us within our respective parties and within the chamber. instead, we will win it by combating waste one agency at a time. madam chair, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from oklahoma (mr. russell). the amendment was agreed to. amendment no. 13 offered by mr. pearce the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 13 printed in house report 114-611. mr. pearce. madam chair, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 2, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $190,970)''. page 5, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $190,970)''. page 6, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $190,970)''. page 42, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert ``(increased by $190,970)''. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 771, the gentleman from new mexico (mr. pearce) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from new mexico. mr. pearce. madam chair, i yield myself such time as i may consume. [[page h3687]] madam chair, despite what has been said about this amendment, it is very simple. there are two bodies that are funded through the appropriations process in the u.s. congress. one is the house committee on ethics. that is the one that we all know as members of congress. but there is another body called the office of congressional ethics that works pretty well outside of this body. now, my amendment is simply taking this year's increase away from that outside body. again, no change to the ethical process inside the body, the one that we are all familiar with and feel accountable to. but we are deducting $191,000 from this outside group because in this time of budget constraints, when i look at my office and all the other offices, our spending has been reduced. our budgets have been reduced by approximately $200,000 since 2008. now, we have to deal with 750,000 to 900,000 constituents. i have five field offices. generally we drive, as a staff, somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 miles per year to deal with our constituents. our budgets have gone down $200,000, with a small increase this year of $12,000. then, on the other hand, i see a $191,000 increase on this outside group. i just feel like that is extraordinary and would suggest that the appropriations bill, h.r. 5325, be reduced in that amount in this budget area. madam chair, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. wasserman schultz. madam chair, i claim the time in opposition to the amendment. the acting chair. the gentlewoman from florida is recognized for 5 minutes. ms. wasserman schultz. madam chair, the office of congressional ethics is crucial to ensuring accountability and transparency in this body. any attempts to cut its budget would only serve to erode our constituents' trust and faith in congress, which certainly has already suffered a significant amount of erosion. as many of my colleagues will recall, the house created the office of congressional ethics nearly a decade ago to improve the integrity of the ethics process in the house. the house was recovering from the mark foley scandal, and it was clear that we needed to do something to rebuild the american people's trust in their elected representatives. that is why oce's core ``mission is to assist the u.s. house in upholding high ethical standards with an eye toward increasing transparency and providing information to the public.'' i acknowledge that there are proposals to improve the operations of the office of congressional ethics, and we should certainly take a look at those, madam chair, but it is common sense that these improvements can't be made by cutting funding for the office that we are actually seeking to improve. moreover, the issue of congressional ethics is far too important to reduce to a 10-minute debate on the house floor. for these reasons, i urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided amendment. madam chair, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pearce. madam chair, i find it odd that we received the words today on the house floor that we are going to increase transparency through the office of congressional ethics. that is exactly what they do not do. the sixth amendment of the constitution gives the accused the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. i will quote from a letter, a legal letter that was given to the oce: this investigation has again revealed due process deficiencies within the oce rules. while the sixth amendment of the united states provides for the fundamental right to confront one's accusers, the oce rules do not allow to confront the accused with the accusers. secondly, the sixth amendment gives us the right to a lawyer. i will again quote from paul solis, an employee of the oce, in an email to my chief of staff: i forgot to mention on our call that should you retain a lawyer for the office, that lawyer would most likely be prohibited under our rules from representing a subject of this review to the extent that subject is a current staff member. so the oce, in their email to our office, says you don't have the right to legal counsel, even though the sixth amendment of the constitution says that you do. the third thing that i see is that we should be able to find out the nature of the charges under the sixth amendment. again, our experience and the experience of others who have confronted oce realizes you do not know what the charges are, you are not going to get to get a lawyer, and you cannot know who is accusing you. this hardly meets the word ``transparency'' that my good friend alluded to. madam chair, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. wasserman schultz. madam chair, while i can appreciate the gentleman's concerns, he has listed a number of substantive differences of opinion with the way the office of congressional ethics handles their work. this appropriations bill is not the appropriate place to address those. the office of congressional ethics was created through legislation. it is a substantive issue, and it is one that should be debated and discussed on an authorizing bill, not on the funding of the legislative branch. you don't just cut the budget of an office with whose decisions you disagree. we can debate and discuss these concerns, but cutting $190,000 out of the oce's budget is not the way to address that. for those reasons and the fact that the public already has some pretty significant concerns with the way we do business here, this would send the wrong message. if we are going to have this discussion, we should do it in a forum that allows for more robust discussion and debate over how to address those challenges long term. madam chair, i reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1145 mr. pearce. madam chair, i would remind my friend and colleague that this amendment only addresses the funding. i simply used my time in order to advertise for this agency and the way that they operate. i would like to quote from an email that i got this morning: i cried when i saw what your boss did last night on the leg branch. this is referring to my amendment. i was unfairly targeted by oce in 2013, for an action in 2008, which had been approved by the ethics committee. oce even admitted there was no evidence. i complied with every provision of the policy, without exception. one of the staffers that was being investigated in this same circumstance left the hill early on. i considered doing the same thing. i certainly had to endure all the phases of the oce process, including referral to the ethics committee. the ethics committee dismissed the case against us, but it is, by far, the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my 21 years on the hill. i am a strong person with resources, and was an emotional wreck over the thought of losing my credibility over an ethics investigation. i cried virtually every day for several months. and the prolonged process over many, many months took a toll on my life. and we are asking to give this agency another $191,000 to continue this kind of action? i think this debate is exactly called for at this moment on this bill and on this spending. madam chair, i urge members to support the amendment to give notice to the oce that we are watching what they are doing. madam chair, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. wasserman schultz. madam chair, how much time do i have remaining? the acting chair. the gentlewoman from florida has 3 minutes remaining. ms. wasserman schultz. madam chair, i have tremendous respect for the gentleman from new mexico and his concerns for the operation of the office of congressional ethics. however, all that we would be doing here, if his amendment were to pass, is to send a $190,000 message to the office of congressional ethics. it would not achieve any of the gentleman's goals. if we do need to take a look at the way the office functions, then there is a process for doing that. the only thing we achieve here by adopting this amendment is cutting their budget by $190,000. so, if the majority believes that it is important to take a look at the function of this office, then there is a process for doing that and to take up legislation to change the way they do business. that is certainly appropriate. but we don't accomplish any of the gentleman's goals by cutting $190,000. [[page h3688]] in fact, the public has certainly already sent multiple messages to the united states congress that they don't have a whole lot of confidence in the business that we are doing here. this would send the absolute wrong message back to them--that we don't get it. so i urge members to oppose the amendment because it would not achieve the gentleman's goals and because we have a more appropriate place to actually achieve those goals in the authorizing committee. madam chair, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from new mexico (mr. pearce). the question was taken; and the acting chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. ms. wasserman schultz. madam chair, i demand a recorded vote. the

was announced as above recorded. the acting chair. there being no further amendments, under the rule, the committee rises. accordingly, the committee rose; and the speaker pro tempore (mr. hultgren) having assumed the chair, ms. foxx, acting chair of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union, reported that that committee, having had under consideration the bill (h.r. 5325) making appropriations for the legislative branch for the fiscal year ending september 30, 2017, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to house resolution 771, she reported the bill back to the house with sundry amendments adopted in the committee of the whole. the speaker pro tempore. under the rule, the previous question is ordered. is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the committee of the whole? if not, the chair will put them en gros. the amendments were agreed to. [[page h3691]] the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. motion to recommit mr. castro of texas. mr. speaker, i have a motion to recommit at the desk. the speaker pro tempore. is the gentleman opposed to the bill? mr. castro of texas. i am opposed to it in its current form. the speaker pro tempore. the clerk will report the motion to recommit. the clerk read as follows: mr. castro of texas moves to recommit the bill h.r. 5325 to the committee on appropriations with instructions to report the same back to the house forthwith with the following amendment: in the ``capital construction and operations'' account, on page 17, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced by $200,000)''. in the ``library of congress--salaries and expenses'' account, on page 25, line 24, after the first dollar amount, insert ``(increased by $200,000)''. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. castro of texas. mr. speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. if adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. mr. speaker, before i speak on this amendment, i yield to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. wasserman schultz), who has been a strong advocate and leader on this issue, for an opportunity to say a few words. ms. wasserman schultz. mr. speaker, i rise to join my colleague, congressman joaquin castro, to urge the majority to finally allow the house to strike a destructive political provision that has made its way into the legislative branch appropriations bill. if those listening are wondering why we are talking about the pejorative term ``illegal aliens'' on the bill that funds the legislative branch, then you are not alone. this legislation's accompanying report includes language that would have the library continue to use the term ``illegal aliens,'' ``to the extent practicable''--even though the library itself has said that there is no practicable means to continue to use the term ``illegal aliens.'' the library changes thousands of subject headings each year without interference from congress. why this one? why now? the library once used the subject heading ``negro,'' then moved to ``afro-american,'' and now ``african american.'' they didn't wait until the entire u.s. code was free of the pejorative term ``negro'' before they changed their subject heading. as a matter of fact, congress only recently removed the last vestiges of the terms ``negro'' and ``oriental'' from the u.s. code in may of 2016. that bill passed with a unanimous vote, including the ``yes'' vote of the chairman of the legislative branch subcommittee. if we removed ``negro'' and ``oriental'' in the subject headings of the library of congress before we changed the u.s. code, then we should do the same for the now-pejorative term, ``illegal alien.'' the library of congress is our nation's first established cultural institution, and it is hard to fathom why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would try to tie its hands to the slow-moving wheels of the u.s. code. entering into an immigration debate on the legislative branch appropriations bill is a terrible precedent. if the majority is really serious about debating the u.s. code, then let's have the republican rules committee bring up the castro bill that would remove the hurtful and inaccurate term ``illegal aliens'' once and for all from the u.s. code. we are members of congress, not captains of the word police. free the card catalog and depoliticize this bill. mr. castro of texas. mr. speaker, may i inquire how much time i have remaining? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from texas has 2 minutes and 35 seconds remaining. mr. castro of texas. mr. speaker, in 1922, the only grandparent i would come to know came from mexico to the united states. she was not a rapist or a murderer or an alien. she was a 6-year-old girl whose parents had died around the time of the mexican revolution, and the closest relatives who could take her and her sister in were in texas. i bet if we went around this chamber, i know there would be beautiful stories, similar stories, of ancestors who came from italy, germany, ireland, africa, asia, and every corner of the world. they are the immigrants to this country. they are the strength of this country. language matters. recently, the library of congress decided to retire the term ``illegal alien'' because it is dehumanizing. for the first time in american history, today, the congress is ready to interfere with the business of the library of congress. in the years of the congress and the library, language has evolved. that is why we have done away with terms like ``negro,'' ``oriental,'' ``lunatic,'' and ``retarded,'' because we understand that even words that start off as neutral descriptors can, over time, become used as verbal weapons and knives to inflict pain and disrespect and sow division. that is the case today. there are times in our country's history where our politics have also been a race to the bottom. those irish ancestors were greeted by signs that read ``no irish need apply'' in cities like new york and boston. the japanese, german, and italian americans even were interned during world war ii. chinese were excluded from this country for decades. during the eisenhower administration, many hispanics in this country were rounded up and deported to mexico even if they were american. {time} 1230 what i am asking is for us not to fuel the flames of this season and for us to take a better course and do the right thing. i am asking you to support this motion to recommit because the words ``illegal alien'' will be retired. this will change, whether it is now or 6 months from now or 10 years from now. the question for all of us is whether we, today, will do the right thing or whether a few years from now we apologize for doing the wrong thing. please support this motion to recommit and do the right thing. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. graves of georgia. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from georgia is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. graves of georgia. mr. speaker, i want to make this quick because i want to make sure the house knows what offensive language is in this bill. it is so offensive that i am going to read it. to the extent practicable, the committee instructs the library to maintain certain subject headings that reflect terminology used in title 8, united states code. that is what is so offensive to the minority party. for 7\1/2\ years, we have had a president who wants to ignore the intent of the laws of our land. we will not allow this body, this house, to ignore the definitions nor the words of the laws that have been voted on in this body, passed by the senate, and signed into law by the president. i am asking this body to vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit, vote ``yes'' to uphold the laws of this land, vote ``yes'' for your constituents on final passage, and have a good weekend. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. there was no objection. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion to recommit. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. recorded vote mr. castro of texas. mr. speaker, i demand a recorded vote. a recorded vote was ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule xx, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5- minute votes on passage of the bill, adoption of house concurrent resolution 89, and adoption of house concurrent resolution 112. the vote was

CREC-2016-06-10-pt1-PgH3694,CREC-2016-06-10,114,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3694-H3696] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring of the schedule of the week to come. (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Members are advised that later votes than normal are possible on Thursday and to keep their travel plans flexible. No votes are expected in the House on Friday. {time} 1300 Madam Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today. The House will consider H.R. 5053, the Preventing the IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act, sponsored by Representative Roskam. This commonsense bill prohibits the IRS from collecting donor information, which has been used by the IRS to improperly target tax-exempt organizations. Finally, Madam Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 5293, the FY17 Defense appropriations bill, sponsored by Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen. We expect a large number of amendments to be considered on this bill. So, again, Members are reminded to keep their travel schedules flexible at the end of next week. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information. Today, we considered a third appropriations bill. It was a structured rule, which is not uncommon on both sides of the aisle to have a structured rule. But next week, the gentleman has announced the Defense appropriations bill, and I am wondering whether or not that will be an open rule so that amendments will be able to be offered by Members without constraint of being limited? I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, to answer the gentleman's question, yes, that will come under a structured rule. So Members will be able to offer amendments but before the Rules Committee and then have the debate on the floor prior to passage of the bill. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, does the gentleman mean by ``structured rule'' that we will simply require amendments to be filed as of a certain time, but that there will be no restriction on amendments that will be in order? I yield to the gentleman from California. [[Page H3695]] Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, it will be a structured rule exactly the same as we have used a structured rule before. Amendments will be presented to the Rules Committee, be debated, and then brought to the floor for a vote. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, to further clarify, my understanding, therefore, is that the majority leader expects the Rules Committee to choose which amendments will be made in order on the bill. Is that accurate? I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, yes, it will be a very fair, wide open process in the Rules Committee looking at amendments--those that have not been able to be offered already in committee, where these bills have gone through subcommittee and full committee with amendments being offered, and then they will be brought to the floor so we can get the work done and move the bill forward. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I understand what the gentleman is saying. And it appears to me that it is an abandonment of the Speaker and others' representations that when appropriations bills are brought to the floor that they will be brought to the floor with an open rule or a rule that will allow any and all amendments that seek to be offered by Members on both sides of the aisle to be offered. From the gentleman's explanation, I believe that is not the case and a deviation from the announced policy at the beginning of the year. It seems to me, Madam Speaker, that it is a pragmatic judgment that some amendments are making it difficult on the gentleman's side of the aisle. As someone who has been here for some period of time, that has been my experience when we were in the majority that the gentleman's side, under open rules, offered a lot of very difficult amendments that we had to confront. The Maloney amendment obviously was a difficult amendment for Members to confront on the gentleman's side and led to the defeat of apparently one of the bills, the Energy and Water bill, which failed on this floor. Would I not be correct in saying that this is a policy that is now being pursued that is different from that which was represented at the beginning of the year where the floor would be open to any and all amendments and would be considered by the House on their merits? I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, the gentleman has sat in this position that I have today as majority leader in the past, and the gentleman knows the history of bills he brought to the floor and the manner in which they did. But if I could be frank with my friend, I am a little disappointed. This is not a place to play politics. This is not about one amendment. We have a process for amendments for Members that are serious about making a passionate argument for a bill, not to kill a bill and not to have an amendment pass and then an entire side of the aisle vote against it. What we are bringing forth is a process that the American people want to see. They want to see ideas get brought here, debated, and moved forward. If we look at the appropriations process in the Senate, they have amendments that go through. If the gentleman wants to go back and recite a history of the number of bills that were open here under his leadership, I more than welcome him to do that. But we should be honest with one another. If Members want to offer an amendment and want to debate the amendment and want to make the bill, in their view, better, I would suspect that, if they win an amendment, they would vote for the bill. The gentleman has a long history here, and that is really probably the history that he remembers as well. I want to see the work get done. So any ideas that get brought forth in committee, they are debated, they are offered, and they are voted on. Ideas will get brought forth further as the bill comes forward. If it is an amendment and someone wants to move it to the floor, so be it. But we are not going to sit back with the idea of people who want to play politics on the outside and play politics on the inside. I just expect more. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Of course, 130 of his Members voted against that bill; 130 of his Members rejected that bill. I am hard pressed to think that the majority leader believes that our ``no'' votes were political and his ``no'' votes were principled. That defies logic from my standpoint. The fact of the matter is that bill lost because the gentleman's Members didn't support it. The gentleman has 247 Members. I do remember being majority leader. Very frankly, I remember getting 218 Democrats for almost every bill we brought to the floor. So we passed them with our votes. If 130 of the gentleman's Members had not voted against their own bill, it would have passed. And there should be no, Madam Speaker, misrepresentation or misinformation about how seriously Mr. Maloney cared about his amendment. There should be none whatsoever. In point of fact, it enjoyed ultimately the majority of support here on this floor. I will tell the gentleman, I have been here for sometime. He is correct on that, and I do offer amendments from time to time to improve bills that, even as improved, I don't like. So, in the final analysis, although I have improved them and been successful in adopting an amendment, I still do not think the bills are appropriate to pass and go into law. This conversation started with the fact that we need to be able to offer ideas. Very frankly, I understand the gentleman's position. Today, we just voted on two bills that aren't going anywhere, a sense of Congress that you are not going to bring to the floor. They have no chance of passage. What did you want to do? You wanted to play politics. I don't mean you personally, Madam Speaker, but it was a political effort solely to bring two bills to the floor to express some sense of Congress, both of which I voted against because I thought they were playing politics. So the accusation somehow that we are playing politics because we offer amendments that we care deeply about, that we want to see no discrimination allowed in our bills and that we want to defeat those constraints on an executive order that says to people who do business with the Federal Government, you can't discriminate against people, I will tell my friend, yes, we are going to continue to try to do that. Now, of course, on this last bill, we were not allowed to do that. We were shut down and shut up and precluded from voting on that particular piece of legislation. So, when I tell my friend that this session started with a pledge for open rules on appropriations bills, I understand the gentleman's problem. Frankly, we had structured rules when we were in charge as well. We had not made any great representation about open rules; therefore, we, too, wanted to get the business of the House done. Yes, I remember well 2007 when we were confronted with a filibuster by amendment. At some point in time, after 10 bills had been very difficult to pass, on the last two bills, we did have structured rules. I tell my friend that I hope that he will accord to Mr. Maloney or others the sincerity of their objectives, notwithstanding the fact that their amendment is adopted and articulates what I think is proper policy for our country, that is, not to discriminate. Everybody in our country apparently doesn't believe that, but Mr. Maloney does. And I want to make it very clear that he was very sincere in that amendment. Those of us who voted for it were very sincere in that amendment. It was not politics; it was values. Moving on, I want to congratulate the majority leader on his work on Puerto Rico. That was a difficult issue for us both, a difficult issue for our caucuses, a difficult issue for the executive department. We worked together. We got a bill done that certainly was not our favorite. The bill included a lot of stuff in there that we didn't like, but I will tell the gentleman that we didn't play politics on that. We only lost 24 votes on a bill that was largely constructed by the gentleman's side of the aisle in terms of some of the issues unrelated, per se, to restructuring of the debt, which was the intent of the bill. So I want the majority leader to know--he and I have a good relationship. I have great respect for him--we [[Page H3696]] are going to intend to try to work together on issues like that that are difficult but are necessary for the American people. Toward that end, can the gentleman tell me what the status of the Zika issue is with reference to getting resources as quickly as possible to confront this challenge to our country's health? I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his work on the Puerto Rico crisis. It is something that we worked on together very early from all leaders' sides, making sure that we protected the taxpayers from a bailout, and I think we met all the criteria for helping Puerto Rico move forward and protecting the taxpayer. The gentleman is correct on Zika. We want to make sure the funding is there. As the gentleman knows, there is currently funding, and, as the gentleman knows, we have passed a bill on Zika and we have named our conferees. It is my understanding that the Senate is just now naming their conferees, so I am very hopeful that we can get that conference done very quickly and a bill brought back to the floor. As of now, I had met with the Director of the CDC the week when we departed before the district work period. There are enough resources currently, but we need to get our work done as rapidly as possible. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Obviously, this is an emergency confronting our country. Dr. Frieden of the CDC, Dr. Fauci of the NIH, and so many others have raised this as a critically important issue for us to confront and confront now. So I would join the majority leader in whatever efforts are necessary to accelerate this process and give to the administration and our health officials the resources they need to protect the American people. Madam Speaker, in closing, I rise to say that we have lost a great American, perhaps one of the most famous Americans in the world in Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali was, for a portion of his life, reviled for the decisions he took. But through his life, he reflected a commitment to principle that all of us could well follow, an example of even in the light of extraordinary opprobrium from his fellow citizens who said, This is what I believe, this is where I stand, and I am prepared to take the consequences. Many of us believe he was probably the greatest fighter that ever lived. As he fought so successfully in the ring, he fought successfully for his principles and his convictions. {time} 1315 I know that the American people and the House of Representatives would reflect the respect and affection for a great athlete and a great human being and a great American. If my friend wanted to make a comment, I will yield to him. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, I thank him for recognizing the life of Muhammad Ali. He touched so many of those who met him and those who did not, and there are so many stories out there of what he was able to do even privately on helping change people's lives and actually stand up for what he believed. I think so many times when you look at his life from where he rose and where he stayed rooted in his belief in this country, his belief in the courage to fight for what he believed in. There was a quote he made. I just read it today. It was put up by Forbes as the quote of the week, but Muhammad Ali once said: ``He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.'' I know they are going to honor his life today. He was one who took risks and had the courage to stand up when others didn't believe the same as he did. One great foundation of this country provides the individuals the right to do that, to challenge others and to live a life that is very full. He lived his life to the fullest and reached many. In the athletic world, he reached the heights, and in reaching others, he did the same in his personal life as well. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3694-H3696] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Amendments will be presented to the Rules Committee, be debated, and then brought to the floor for a vote. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, to further clarify, my understanding, therefore, is that the majority leader expects the Rules Committee to choose which amendments will be made in order on the bill. Is that accurate? I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, yes, it will be a very fair, wide open process in the Rules Committee looking at amendments--those that have not been able to be offered already in committee, where these bills have gone through subcommittee and full committee with amendments being offered, and then they will be brought to the floor so we can get the work done and move the bill forward. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I understand what the gentleman is saying. And it appears to me that it is an abandonment of the Speaker and others' representations that when appropriations bills are brought to the floor that they will be brought to the floor with an open rule or a rule that will allow any and all amendments that seek to be offered by Members on both sides of the aisle to be offered. From the gentleman's explanation, I believe that is not the case and a deviation from the announced policy at the beginning of the year. It seems to me, Madam Speaker, that it is a pragmatic judgment that some amendments are making it difficult on the gentleman's side of the aisle. As someone who has been here for some period of time, that has been my experience when we were in the majority that the gentleman's side, under open rules, offered a lot of very difficult amendments that we had to confront. The Maloney amendment obviously was a difficult amendment for Members to confront on the gentleman's side and led to the defeat of apparently one of the bills, the Energy and Water bill, which failed on this floor. Would I not be correct in saying that this is a policy that is now being pursued that is different from that which was represented at the beginning of the year where the floor would be open to any and all amendments and would be considered by the House on their merits? I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, the gentleman has sat in this position that I have today as majority leader in the past, and the gentleman knows the history of bills he brought to the floor and the manner in which they did. But if I could be frank with my friend, I am a little disappointed. This is not a place to play politics. This is not about one amendment. We have a process for amendments for Members that are serious about making a passionate argument for a bill, not to kill a bill and not to have an amendment pass and then an entire side of the aisle vote against it. What we are bringing forth is a process that the American people want to see. They want to see ideas get brought here, debated, and moved forward. If we look at the appropriations process in the Senate, they have amendments that go through. If the gentleman wants to go back and recite a history of the number of bills that were open here under his leadership, I more than welcome him to do that. But we should be honest with one another. If Members want to offer an amendment and want to debate the amendment and want to make the bill, in their view, better, I would suspect that, if they win an amendment, they would vote for the bill. The gentleman has a long history here, and that is really probably the history that he remembers as well. I want to see the work get done. So any ideas that get brought forth in committee, they are debated, they are offered, and they are voted on. Ideas will get brought forth further as the bill comes forward. If it is an amendment and someone wants to move it to the floor, so be it. But we are not going to sit back with the idea of people who want to play politics on the outside and play politics on the inside. I just expect more. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Of course, 130 of his Members voted against that bill; 130 of his Members rejected that bill. I am hard pressed to think that the majority leader believes that our ``no'' votes were political and his ``no'' votes were principled. That defies logic from my standpoint. The fact of the matter is that bill lost because the gentleman's Members didn't support it. The gentleman has 247 Members. I do remember being majority leader. Very frankly, I remember getting 218 Democrats for almost every bill we brought to the floor. So we passed them with our votes. If 130 of the gentleman's Members had not voted against their own bill, it would have passed. And there should be no, Madam Speaker, misrepresentation or misinformation about how seriously Mr. Maloney cared about his amendment. There should be none whatsoever. In point of fact, it enjoyed ultimately the majority of support here on this floor. I will tell the gentleman, I have been here for sometime. He is correct on that, and I do offer amendments from time to time to improve bills that, even as improved, I don't like. So, in the final analysis, although I have improved them and been successful in adopting an amendment, I still do not think the bills are appropriate to pass and go into law. This conversation started with the fact that we need to be able to offer ideas. Very frankly, I understand the gentleman's position. Today, we just voted on two bills that aren't going anywhere, a sense of Congress that you are not going to bring to the floor. They have no chance of passage. What did you want to do? You wanted to play politics. I don't mean you personally, Madam Speaker, but it was a political effort solely to bring two bills to the floor to express some sense of Congress, both of which I voted against because I thought they were playing politics. So the accusation somehow that we are playing politics because we offer amendments that we care deeply about, that we want to see no discrimination allowed in our bills and that we want to defeat those constraints on an executive order that says to people who do business with the Federal Government, you can't discriminate against people, I will tell my friend, yes, we are going to continue to try to do that. Now, of course, on this last bill, we were not allowed to do that. We were shut down and shut up and precluded from voting on that particular piece of legislation. So, when I tell my friend that this session started with a pledge for open rules on appropriations bills, I understand the gentleman's problem. Frankly, we had structured rules when we were in charge as well. We had not made any great representation about open rules; therefore, we, too, wanted to get the business of the House done. Yes, I remember well 2007 when we were confronted with a filibuster by amendment. At some point in time, after 10 bills had been very difficult to pass, on the last two bills, we did have structured rules. I tell my friend that I hope that he will accord to Mr. Maloney or others the sincerity of their objectives, notwithstanding the fact that their amendment is adopted and articulates what I think is proper policy for our country, that is, not to discriminate. Everybody in our country apparently doesn't believe that, but Mr. Maloney does. And I want to make it very clear that he was very sincere in that amendment. Those of us who voted for it were very sincere in that amendment. It was not politics; it was values. Moving on, I want to congratulate the majority leader on his work on Puerto Rico. That was a difficult issue for us both, a difficult issue for our caucuses, a difficult issue for the executive department. We worked together. We got a bill done that certainly was not our favorite. The bill included a lot of stuff in there that we didn't like, but I will tell the gentleman that we didn't play politics on that. We only lost 24 votes on a bill that was largely constructed by the gentleman's side of the aisle in terms of some of the issues unrelated, per se, to restructuring of the debt, which was the intent of the bill. So I want the majority leader to know--he and I have a good relationship. I have great respect for him--we [[Page H3696]] are going to intend to try to work together on issues like that that are difficult but are necessary for the American people. Toward that end, can the gentleman tell me what the status of the Zika issue is with reference to getting resources as quickly as possible to confront this challenge to our country's health? I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his work on the Puerto Rico crisis. It is something that we worked on together very early from all leaders' sides, making sure that we protected the taxpayers from a bailout, and I think we met all the criteria for helping Puerto Rico move forward and protecting the taxpayer. The gentleman is correct on Zika. We want to make sure the funding is there. As the gentleman knows, there is currently funding, and, as the gentleman knows, we have passed a bill on Zika and we have named our conferees. It is my understanding that the Senate is just now naming their conferees, so I am very hopeful that we can get that conference done very quickly and a bill brought back to the floor. As of now, I had met with the Director of the CDC the week when we departed before the district work period. There are enough resources currently, but we need to get our work done as rapidly as possible. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Obviously, this is an emergency confronting our country. Dr. Frieden of the CDC, Dr. Fauci of the NIH, and so many others have raised this as a critically important issue for us to confront and confront now. So I would join the majority leader in whatever efforts are necessary to accelerate this process and give to the administration and our health officials the resources they need to protect the American people. Madam Speaker, in closing, I rise to say that we have lost a great American, perhaps one of the most famous Americans in the world in Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali was, for a portion of his life, reviled for the decisions he took. But through his life, he reflected a commitment to principle that all of us could well follow, an example of even in the light of extraordinary opprobrium from his fellow citizens who said, This is what I believe, this is where I stand, and I am prepared to take the consequences. Many of us believe he was probably the greatest fighter that ever lived. As he fought so successfully in the ring, he fought successfully for his principles and his convictions. {time} 1315 I know that the American people and the House of Representatives would reflect the respect and affection for a great athlete and a great human being and a great American. If my friend wanted to make a comment, I will yield to him. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, I thank him for recognizing the life of Muhammad Ali. He touched so many of those who met him and those who did not, and there are so many stories out there of what he was able to do even privately on helping change people's lives and actually stand up for what he believed. I think so many times when you look at his life from where he rose and where he stayed rooted in his belief in this country, his belief in the courage to fight for what he believed in. There was a quote he made. I just read it today. It was put up by Forbes as the quote of the week, but Muhammad Ali once said: ``He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.'' I know they are going to honor his life today. He was one who took risks and had the courage to stand up when others didn't believe the same as he did. One great foundation of this country provides the individuals the right to do that, to challenge others and to live a life that is very full. He lived his life to the fullest and reached many. In the athletic world, he reached the heights, and in reaching others, he did the same in his personal life as well. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3694-H3696] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring of the schedule of the week to come. (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Members are advised that later votes than normal are possible on Thursday and to keep their travel plans flexible. No votes are expected in the House on Friday. {time} 1300 Madam Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today. The House will consider H.R. 5053, the Preventing the IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act, sponsored by Representative Roskam. This commonsense bill prohibits the IRS from collecting donor information, which has been used by the IRS to improperly target tax-exempt organizations. Finally, Madam Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 5293, the FY17 Defense appropriations bill, sponsored by Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen. We expect a large number of amendments to be considered on this bill. So, again, Members are reminded to keep their travel schedules flexible at the end of next week. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information. Today, we considered a third appropriations bill. It was a structured rule, which is not uncommon on both sides of the aisle to have a structured rule. But next week, the gentleman has announced the Defense appropriations bill, and I am wondering whether or not that will be an open rule so that amendments will be able to be offered by Members without constraint of being limited? I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, to answer the gentleman's question, yes, that will come under a structured rule. So Members will be able to offer amendments but before the Rules Committee and then have the debate on the floor prior to passage of the bill. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, does the gentleman mean by ``structured rule'' that we will simply require amendments to be filed as of a certain time, but that there will be no restriction on amendments that will be in order? I yield to the gentleman from California. [[Page H3695]] Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, it will be a structured rule exactly the same as we have used a structured rule before.

i yield to the gentleman from california. mr. mccarthy. madam speaker, the gentleman has sat in this position that i have today as majority leader in the past, and the gentleman knows the history of bills he brought to the floor and the manner in which they did. but if i could be frank with my friend, i am a little disappointed. this is not a place to play politics. this is not about one amendment. we have a process for amendments for members that are serious about making a passionate argument for a bill, not to kill a bill and not to have an amendment pass and then an entire side of the aisle vote against it. what we are bringing forth is a process that the american people want to see. they want to see ideas get brought here, debated, and moved forward. if we look at the appropriations process in the senate, they have amendments that go through. if the gentleman wants to go back and recite a history of the number of bills that were open here under his leadership, i more than welcome him to do that. but we should be honest with one another. if members want to offer an amendment and want to debate the amendment and want to make the bill, in their view, better, i would suspect that, if they win an amendment, they would vote for the bill. the gentleman has a long history here, and that is really probably the history that he remembers as well. i want to see the work get done. so any ideas that get brought forth in committee, they are debated, they are offered, and they are voted on. ideas will get brought forth further as the bill comes forward. if it is an amendment and someone wants to move it to the floor, so be it. but we are not going to sit back with the idea of people who want to play politics on the outside and play politics on the inside. i just expect more. mr. hoyer. madam speaker, i thank the gentleman for his comments. of course, 130 of his members voted against that bill; 130 of his members rejected that bill. i am hard pressed to think that the majority leader believes that our ``no'' votes were political and his ``no'' votes were principled. that defies logic from my standpoint. the fact of the matter is that bill lost because the gentleman's members didn't support it. the gentleman has 247 members. i do remember being majority leader. very frankly, i remember getting 218 democrats for almost every bill we brought to the floor. so we passed them with our votes. if 130 of the gentleman's members had not voted against their own bill, it would have passed. and there should be no, madam speaker, misrepresentation or misinformation about how seriously mr. maloney cared about his amendment. there should be none whatsoever. in point of fact, it enjoyed ultimately the majority of support here on this floor. i will tell the gentleman, i have been here for sometime. he is correct on that, and i do offer amendments from time to time to improve bills that, even as improved, i don't like. so, in the final analysis, although i have improved them and been successful in adopting an amendment, i still do not think the bills are appropriate to pass and go into law. this conversation started with the fact that we need to be able to offer ideas. very frankly, i understand the gentleman's position. today, we just voted on two bills that aren't going anywhere, a sense of congress that you are not going to bring to the floor. they have no chance of passage. what did you want to do? you wanted to play politics. i don't mean you personally, madam speaker, but it was a political effort solely to bring two bills to the floor to express some sense of congress, both of which i voted against because i thought they were playing politics. so the accusation somehow that we are playing politics because we offer amendments that we care deeply about, that we want to see no discrimination allowed in our bills and that we want to defeat those constraints on an executive order that says to people who do business with the federal government, you can't discriminate against people, i will tell my friend, yes, we are going to continue to try to do that. now, of course, on this last bill, we were not allowed to do that. we were shut down and shut up and precluded from voting on that particular piece of legislation. so, when i tell my friend that this session started with a pledge for open rules on appropriations bills, i understand the gentleman's problem. frankly, we had structured rules when we were in charge as well. we had not made any great representation about open rules; therefore, we, too, wanted to get the business of the house done. yes, i remember well 2007 when we were confronted with a filibuster by amendment. at some point in time, after 10 bills had been very difficult to pass, on the last two bills, we did have structured rules. i tell my friend that i hope that he will accord to mr. maloney or others the sincerity of their objectives, notwithstanding the fact that their amendment is adopted and articulates what i think is proper policy for our country, that is, not to discriminate. everybody in our country apparently doesn't believe that, but mr. maloney does. and i want to make it very clear that he was very sincere in that amendment. those of us who voted for it were very sincere in that amendment. it was not politics; it was values. moving on, i want to congratulate the majority leader on his work on puerto rico. that was a difficult issue for us both, a difficult issue for our caucuses, a difficult issue for the executive department. we worked together. we got a bill done that certainly was not our favorite. the bill included a lot of stuff in there that we didn't like, but i will tell the gentleman that we didn't play politics on that. we only lost 24 votes on a bill that was largely constructed by the gentleman's side of the aisle in terms of some of the issues unrelated, per se, to restructuring of the debt, which was the intent of the bill. so i want the majority leader to know--he and i have a good relationship. i have great respect for him--we [[page h3696]] are going to intend to try to work together on issues like that that are difficult but are necessary for the american people. toward that end, can the gentleman tell me what the status of the zika issue is with reference to getting resources as quickly as possible to confront this challenge to our country's health? i yield to the gentleman from california. mr. mccarthy. madam speaker, i thank the gentleman for his work on the puerto rico crisis. it is something that we worked on together very early from all leaders' sides, making sure that we protected the taxpayers from a bailout, and i think we met all the criteria for helping puerto rico move forward and protecting the taxpayer. the gentleman is correct on zika. we want to make sure the funding is there. as the gentleman knows, there is currently funding, and, as the gentleman knows, we have passed a bill on zika and we have named our conferees. it is my understanding that the senate is just now naming their conferees, so i am very hopeful that we can get that conference done very quickly and a bill brought back to the floor. as of now, i had met with the director of the cdc the week when we departed before the district work period. there are enough resources currently, but we need to get our work done as rapidly as possible. mr. hoyer. madam speaker, i thank the gentleman for his comments. obviously, this is an emergency confronting our country. dr. frieden of the cdc, dr. fauci of the nih, and so many others have raised this as a critically important issue for us to confront and confront now. so i would join the majority leader in whatever efforts are necessary to accelerate this process and give to the administration and our health officials the resources they need to protect the american people. madam speaker, in closing, i rise to say that we have lost a great american, perhaps one of the most famous americans in the world in muhammad ali. muhammad ali was, for a portion of his life, reviled for the decisions he took. but through his life, he reflected a commitment to principle that all of us could well follow, an example of even in the light of extraordinary opprobrium from his fellow citizens who said, this is what i believe, this is where i stand, and i am prepared to take the consequences. many of us believe he was probably the greatest fighter that ever lived. as he fought so successfully in the ring, he fought successfully for his principles and his convictions. {time} 1315 i know that the american people and the house of representatives would reflect the respect and affection for a great athlete and a great human being and a great american. if my friend wanted to make a comment, i will yield to him. mr. mccarthy. i thank the gentleman for yielding, i thank him for recognizing the life of muhammad ali. he touched so many of those who met him and those who did not, and there are so many stories out there of what he was able to do even privately on helping change people's lives and actually stand up for what he believed. i think so many times when you look at his life from where he rose and where he stayed rooted in his belief in this country, his belief in the courage to fight for what he believed in. there was a quote he made. i just read it today. it was put up by forbes as the quote of the week, but muhammad ali once said: ``he who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.'' i know they are going to honor his life today. he was one who took risks and had the courage to stand up when others didn't believe the same as he did. one great foundation of this country provides the individuals the right to do that, to challenge others and to live a life that is very full. he lived his life to the fullest and reached many. in the athletic world, he reached the heights, and in reaching others, he did the same in his personal life as well. mr. hoyer. i thank the gentleman for his comments. madam speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",15187

In January, the Obama administration cut a $1.7 billion check to the Government of Iran. On May 18, Iran's Guardian Council voted to send all of this money to Iran's military. Secretary of State Kerry was asked in January whether this money would be used to fund terrorism. He responded: I think that some of it will wind up in the hands of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists. This week, we can sadly confirm that this has indeed come to pass, that the entire $1.7 billion from the U.S. taxpayers will now be used to fund Iran's military and terrorism apparatus. This is the same Iran that routinely chants ``Death to America,'' threatens to wipe Israel off of the map, captures and humiliates our U.S. sailors, and brazenly fires missiles in close proximity to America's naval vessels, and is responsible for the killing of hundreds of American troops.

We cannot wait one more minute for Congress to act. We must do something now to prevent further spreading of the Zika virus. I am outraged we do not have a solution to something that can hurt an entire generation of our children. Because of Zika's serious debilitating impacts, Americans are afraid to travel, Americans are afraid to go outside, and Americans are now terrified to grow their families. I urge leadership to schedule a vote on H.R. 3299.

Ms. McSALLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate Darla Sidles, superintendent of Saguaro National Park, on her recent appointment to oversee the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, and I thank her for her 7 years of service to the people of Arizona. Under Darla's leadership, Saguaro National Park set record highs for attendance, attracting over 750,000 people last year. Her tenure saw the complete refurbishment of the Rincon Mountain Visitor Center and successful application of key resilient landscapes grants. She also spearheaded efforts to connect the park with local young and urban populations, helping expose them to the many treasures the park offers. In addition to her role as director of one of southern Arizona's largest parks, she is a valued leader in our community who served for 4 years on the January 8 Memorial Foundation board. I had the privilege to hike Saguaro National Park with Darla, pictured here, to talk about its value. We continue to work together on efforts to protect and improve this Tucson gem. We will be sad to lose her in August, and no doubt Darla's standout leadership of our park contributed to her appointment to oversee the third-most-visited national park in the country. I thank her for her service, and I wish her well in Colorado. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Page H3697] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATIONS TO DARLA SIDLES (Ms. McSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

CREC-2016-06-10-pt1-PgH3698-2,CREC-2016-06-10,114,STUDENT LOAN DEBT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3698-H3699] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STUDENT LOAN DEBT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, it is good to be back on the House floor to pick up on an issue that concerns most every American that has gone to college, who is now in school, or beyond. I remember a day 3 weeks ago at the Calaveras County Fair. The security guard at the gate greeted me. He said: Congressman. I said: Yes. He said: I need your help. I said: What can I do for you? He said: Well, I had to go back to school to get the license and the education for this job. I now run the security program here. I will be over 70 years of age before I am able to pay off my student loan. He was probably in his early fifties at that time. I said: How can that be? He said: The interest rate is killing me. And, indeed, not only killing him, but all across this Nation, the issue of student debt is harming families, holding back the formation of families--not getting married because you have to pay off the debt, and who would want to marry that person with all that debt? I don't think so--buying houses, getting a car, carrying on in your life. Student debt is an incredible burden on the American public. And not just the students but, in many cases, the parents of students. Here is what has happened with student debt: It is now over $2.2 trillion. Probably today it is much larger than the debt on credit cards. The growth has been almost exponential. And we are continuing to see this rise. It is not over. Continuing the debt is part of America's reality. Here are some astonishing facts about student debt: Not only is it $1.2 trillion, but it is continuing to increase at $2,726.27 every second. So we are going to see this go way beyond $1.2 trillion to, and probably approaching, nearly $1.5 trillion by the end of this decade. The number of borrowers and the average balance of their debt has grown by 70 percent between 2004 and 2012. That is more than 7 percent per year. And finally, down here, we can say that the average student loan debt for graduate students is now over $35,000 per student. This is an extraordinary burden. Now, tell me, what family in America has not refinanced their home? I think we all have. Certainly, Patti and I have refinanced our home. And I suspect most Americans, if they haven't yet refinanced, are watching the interest rates and looking for that moment when they, too, will refinance their home. So the question for us today is: Why not refinance student loans just the same as we refinance our homes? Well, the loans are owned by the Federal Government. So this is a question for us in Congress to say: Yes, let's do something to give the American economy a boost. Let's give something to those families, those young students that are out of school and those that are still in school--an opportunity to refinance their loans and to recalculate the interest on loans that they will be taking out in the months and years ahead. Take a look at this. Undergraduate loans from the Federal Government are now 4.29 percent. If you are in the other programs, it may be 5 percent. And if you are in the graduate program, it is 6.84 percent. The Federal Government can borrow money somewhere less than 2 percent, or right around 2 percent for 10 years. If you add another percent for administrative costs, we could refinance all that $1.2 trillion of student loans down to 3.23 percent. What a break that would give to students in school and out of school and those that are going to be borrowing money for the next school year, 3.2 percent versus 4.29 percent. Or, if you are a graduate student, 3.2 percent versus 6.84 percent--less than half the interest rate. We can do it. We can do this. And when we do it, we can help those students that are now carrying that incredible burden of having to pay these extraordinary interest rates to the Federal Government, which is actually making a $138 billion profit on the backs of students. So I go back to that gentleman there at the Calaveras County Fair who now has a business, but also has a student loan that he took out to get the education he needed to start that business. I would go back to him and say: I will tell you what. Instead of a 6 percent or 7 percent loan, we can refinance your loan down to 3.23 percent. And what does it mean to the individual student? It means a great deal. So we have introduced H.R. 5274, the Student Loan Refinancing and Recalculation Act. It will do the following. It would set all student loan interest rates at 3.25 percent--new ones that come up, existing ones, graduate loans, low-income family loans, and the like. If you happen to be a low-income family, and many of these students are--in fact, the great majority of low-income student are, in fact, taking out loans. For those borrowers, it will be thousands of dollars of interest saved, because we also calculate that the interest will not begin to accrue until after graduation. Also, we know that the average savings for students will be over $2,000 on their loans. [[Page H3699]] It also eliminates the origination fee. Why is the Federal Government charging an origination fee when a student actually goes to the financial office at the university and the paperwork is done by the university? Yet the Federal Government--your Federal Government--is sticking it one more way to the students by charging an origination fee. So the new piece of legislation, H.R. 5274, the Student Loan Refinancing and Recalculation Act, is an enormous advantage to the American economy by allowing these students to hang on to a little bit more of their money and to engage in the economy: get married, get a car, buy a house. I had an interesting conversation with the bankers that came into my office a while back. They said: The interest rate is not the only problem. I said: Really? What is the rest of it? They said: These students are carrying these loans on their assets or their liabilities, and when we look at their asset-liability, we see this enormous debt, and we cannot even offer them a loan. He said: If you are able to reduce that--the interest rate and, therefore, the payments that are required--we will be better able to offer them a loan for a car or a house. So let's do it. The Federal Government ought not be making $138 billion profit on the backs of students. We can borrow money at less than 2 percent or right around 2 percent for 10 years. Let's refinance all of those $1.2 trillion of loans down to 3.2 percent. And for the new loans that the students are going to be taking up this coming year, let's give them a break. Instead of 4, 5, or 6 percent, let's do 3.2 percent. It is just 1 percent more than the Federal Government can borrow money. So keep in mind H.R. 5274, the Student Loan Refinancing and Recalculation Act. My colleagues, let's do it. Let's do it for the students--both new and existing students--and families that have taken out loans so that their children can get ahead, so that those students that have taken out that loan can have the burden reduced. Refinance your house, refinance your student loan. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3698-H3699] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STUDENT LOAN DEBT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk).

i don't think so--buying houses, getting a car, carrying on in your life. student debt is an incredible burden on the american public. and not just the students but, in many cases, the parents of students. here is what has happened with student debt: it is now over $2.2 trillion. probably today it is much larger than the debt on credit cards. the growth has been almost exponential. and we are continuing to see this rise. it is not over. continuing the debt is part of america's reality. here are some astonishing facts about student debt: not only is it $1.2 trillion, but it is continuing to increase at $2,726.27 every second. so we are going to see this go way beyond $1.2 trillion to, and probably approaching, nearly $1.5 trillion by the end of this decade. the number of borrowers and the average balance of their debt has grown by 70 percent between 2004 and 2012. that is more than 7 percent per year. and finally, down here, we can say that the average student loan debt for graduate students is now over $35,000 per student. this is an extraordinary burden. now, tell me, what family in america has not refinanced their home? i think we all have. certainly, patti and i have refinanced our home. and i suspect most americans, if they haven't yet refinanced, are watching the interest rates and looking for that moment when they, too, will refinance their home. so the question for us today is: why not refinance student loans just the same as we refinance our homes? well, the loans are owned by the federal government. so this is a question for us in congress to say: yes, let's do something to give the american economy a boost. let's give something to those families, those young students that are out of school and those that are still in school--an opportunity to refinance their loans and to recalculate the interest on loans that they will be taking out in the months and years ahead. take a look at this. undergraduate loans from the federal government are now 4.29 percent. if you are in the other programs, it may be 5 percent. and if you are in the graduate program, it is 6.84 percent. the federal government can borrow money somewhere less than 2 percent, or right around 2 percent for 10 years. if you add another percent for administrative costs, we could refinance all that $1.2 trillion of student loans down to 3.23 percent. what a break that would give to students in school and out of school and those that are going to be borrowing money for the next school year, 3.2 percent versus 4.29 percent. or, if you are a graduate student, 3.2 percent versus 6.84 percent--less than half the interest rate. we can do it. we can do this. and when we do it, we can help those students that are now carrying that incredible burden of having to pay these extraordinary interest rates to the federal government, which is actually making a $138 billion profit on the backs of students. so i go back to that gentleman there at the calaveras county fair who now has a business, but also has a student loan that he took out to get the education he needed to start that business. i would go back to him and say: i will tell you what. instead of a 6 percent or 7 percent loan, we can refinance your loan down to 3.23 percent. and what does it mean to the individual student? it means a great deal. so we have introduced h.r. 5274, the student loan refinancing and recalculation act. it will do the following. it would set all student loan interest rates at 3.25 percent--new ones that come up, existing ones, graduate loans, low-income family loans, and the like. if you happen to be a low-income family, and many of these students are--in fact, the great majority of low-income student are, in fact, taking out loans. for those borrowers, it will be thousands of dollars of interest saved, because we also calculate that the interest will not begin to accrue until after graduation. also, we know that the average savings for students will be over $2,000 on their loans. [[page h3699]] it also eliminates the origination fee. why is the federal government charging an origination fee when a student actually goes to the financial office at the university and the paperwork is done by the university? yet the federal government--your federal government--is sticking it one more way to the students by charging an origination fee. so the new piece of legislation, h.r. 5274, the student loan refinancing and recalculation act, is an enormous advantage to the american economy by allowing these students to hang on to a little bit more of their money and to engage in the economy: get married, get a car, buy a house. i had an interesting conversation with the bankers that came into my office a while back. they said: the interest rate is not the only problem. i said: really? what is the rest of it? they said: these students are carrying these loans on their assets or their liabilities, and when we look at their asset-liability, we see this enormous debt, and we cannot even offer them a loan. he said: if you are able to reduce that--the interest rate and, therefore, the payments that are required--we will be better able to offer them a loan for a car or a house. so let's do it. the federal government ought not be making $138 billion profit on the backs of students. we can borrow money at less than 2 percent or right around 2 percent for 10 years. let's refinance all of those $1.2 trillion of loans down to 3.2 percent. and for the new loans that the students are going to be taking up this coming year, let's give them a break. instead of 4, 5, or 6 percent, let's do 3.2 percent. it is just 1 percent more than the federal government can borrow money. so keep in mind h.r. 5274, the student loan refinancing and recalculation act. my colleagues, let's do it. let's do it for the students--both new and existing students--and families that have taken out loans so that their children can get ahead, so that those students that have taken out that loan can have the burden reduced. refinance your house, refinance your student loan. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",7525
CREC-2016-06-10-pt1-PgH3699,CREC-2016-06-10,114,GUANTANAMO BAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3699-H3702] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUANTANAMO BAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, there is an issue we have been talking about on the Republican side for quite a bit, and I think some of my Democratic friends realize how serious an issue this is because they care about our military members. The President of the United States promised, ill-advisedly, before he was ever elected, that he was going to close the Guantanamo Bay facility that housed the worst of the worst terrorists wanting to kill Americans and destroy our way of life. Well, he found out right after he took office that you just can't do that because it is going to put American lives at risk. There is a reason they are being held there. And it violates no rules of law when it comes to war, because war is a little different. Since civilized society came along in the history of mankind, things improved for prisoners of war. Before there was a civilized society, when one group warred against another, they would either kill them or make them slaves. What occurred was pretty gruesome. In civilized history, when one group says, ``We are at war with this other group,'' then the other group either responds by defending themselves or they are overtaken by the evildoers--in this case, radical Islamists. Since the history of more civilized warfare--if we can call it such, because war is truly hell--noble nations played by rules that said, if you capture someone who is part of the group at war with you, then you hold them as prisoners in a humane fashion until such time as the group of which they are a part agrees that they are no longer at war. If the war drags on 15, 20, 30, 50 years, it is not the fault of the country that captures people at war with them, because that country did not start the war. In this case, the radical Islamists have had this small part of Islam since its beginning and felt like the way to be truly religiously Islamic is to kill anybody that stands in your way of having an international caliphate and forcing everyone in the world to bow before Allah and Islam, in the name of Islam. {time} 1345 It is not our fault if they will not say we are no longer at war with you, because once that happens, then you release those prisoners who were part of the group that was at war with you. And if some of them can be proven to be guilty of actual war crimes against humanity, then you take them to trial, and you try to convict them. And if you do, as we saw after World War II, if they are convicted and sentenced to death, that occurs. If they are sentenced to prison, that is on top of the years that we waited while their group continued to be at war with us. That is under the civilized rules of warfare. Guantanamo Bay, I can say, having been there more than once, and also having toured many State and Federal prisons, has provided the most humane treatment I have ever seen a group of prisoners get. For example, in a Texas prison, if you throw urine or feces on a guard, you will suffer consequences for that decision. I found out on one of my trips to Guantanamo Bay prison that when, as often happens, an inmate figures out a way to throw urine or feces on one of our military member guards, that because we don't want to be perceived as having some mean-spirited prison, we take away a couple of their movie- watching hours during some day to teach them a lesson. And there have been instances where, when they didn't like the movies being presented, perhaps they hadn't been screened properly enough, maybe some woman exposed a bare arm and that offended somebody, well, there was uproar, problems. But if somebody committed a really egregious crime of assaulting one of our guards, then they might actually lose some of their time outside for a day or two. It bothered me greatly to find out that the guards were not allowed to even say anything when someone threw urine or feces on them who was an inmate at Guantanamo Bay; because one such United States military member, I think they said he was a minority member of our United States military, had feces thrown on him, and he angrily said a name, and he received an article 15 non-judicial punishment, and he was punished for simply saying something back after he had feces thrown on him. Well, that ought to be the least of the problems. And I couldn't believe one of our military members who had been assaulted in such a despicable manner was the one punished for saying something back to the inmate that threw feces on him. But the President is determined to follow through with this same kind of policy idea that he has had since the beginning, when he had his apology tour going throughout the Middle East, apologizing in Egypt, apologizing around the world for America, who has been the only country that I can find in history that has shed so much precious American blood, so much blood of our Americans for other people's freedom. We didn't owe anybody an apology, not for that. And there is this mentality among some liberals like our President that the world will be so much safer and a so much better place to live if America were brought down and were not a superpower and you let other countries be superpowers, like, for example, Iran. Let's give Iran $100 billion, $150 billion access to that, and let's let them become a superpower, and we will negotiate a deal that, hopefully, will prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon while President Obama is in office. And then who cares what happens after that; right? But the deal that was negotiated pretty well assures that Iran will have nuclear weapons. It is just a matter of when. And now we know that Iran has repeatedly broken their agreement and we know that this administration, as we found out, this administration actually manipulated video to try to cover up just how bad the deal was that this State Department was negotiating. [[Page H3700]] I didn't really need to see the story to know this kind of stuff was going on. When I saw that Wendy Sherman was maybe chief negotiator, working with the Secretary of State, who was also part of the glorious deal that the Clinton administration, along with Madeleine Albright, negotiated with North Korea, basically--and this is my translation of the deal--but, okay. We are going to make sure that you have nuclear power, and we will make sure you have got nuclear fuel, you have got everything you need to make a nuclear weapon so long as you will sign an agreement saying that you are not going to use it to create a nuclear weapon. You can't help but think of all the snickering that went on in North Korea, especially by Kim Jong-il: Wow, all they want is my signature and they will give us what we need to make a nuclear weapon? Sure. Where do I sign? I mean, it really reminded me of the story Jeff Foxworthy told about, before he made money as a comedian, he was down on his luck. A guy shows up at the door, says, ``I'm here to repossess your car.'' ``Oh, please don't take my car. If you take my car, I can't make it to any of my gigs. I can't make money, and then I have no chance of paying for the car. So please, don't take my car.'' ``I'm sorry, Mr. Foxworthy. I'm here, and I'm supposed to either leave with your car or with cash payment or with a check.'' And Foxworthy basically said, ``A check? You'll take a check? I didn't know you'd take a check.'' ``Yeah, how much do you want me to make it out for?'' ``I'm glad to write you a check. Sure, you just tell me.'' And then he signs and gives the check and he keeps his car. That had to be the kind of mentality. You mean, you will give us everything we need in North Korea to have nuclear weapons, and all we have to do is sign and you're good with that? Wow. Okay. Let us sign. So they signed. We make sure they have what they need for nuclear weapons in the name of giving them nuclear power, and sure enough--very expectedly by some of us because it was such a stupid thing to do, the Clinton administration, with Wendy Sherman right there in the negotiations--we gave them the ability to create nuclear weapons, which they have done. The same way with Iran. Their leaders must have been laughing behind our backs, because we know what they were saying publicly while they were still continuing to say ``death to America,'' still calling us the ``Great Satan,'' still saying they weren't going to abide by any agreement, that the United States would never get them to do what we wanted them to. Oh, so while we are telling the public we are not going to go along with any deal we sign, you are still willing to accept our signature on a deal? For sure, we will sign, because even Allah allows us to sign something that is a lie if, in the end, it furthers his kingdom, in their way of thinking. So if we had strong enough leadership in the United States Senate, what would happen would be there would be a call for a vote on the Iran treaty, which it is. It modifies other treaty provisions and, therefore, you can't do that unless it is a treaty, so it is a treaty. The Constitution says that requires two-thirds of the Senate to vote for the treaty in order for it to be ratified. The Senate took up this Corker bill, that turned the Constitution upside down, and said, no, we are going to say it takes two-thirds to vote against a deal; otherwise, it goes forward. Bob Corker is a really nice guy, but, my word, the damage that was done to the Middle East and to the world by the Senate taking an approach to the Iran treaty as if it wasn't really a treaty. There is still time. Take the vote in the Senate. I know that 60 votes are required for cloture; but when Harry Reid felt like getting very liberal judges into Federal courts was more important than the cloture rule, he had 51 Democrats vote to set aside the cloture rule, and they put in the liberal judges they wanted over the Republican objection. This Iran treaty is going to eventually bring so much death and destruction to not only the Middle East, but, as Netanyahu has warned us, they are not preparing those intercontinental ballistic missiles for Israel. Those are for us. They can already hit Israel. They are for us. So what do we see in the news now, other than the fact that Iran-- well, this article says: ``Iran Spends $1.7 Billion in U.S. Taxpayer Funds to Boost Its Military.'' And it says in this June 9 article from Free Beacon, by Adam Kredo: ``The State Department is staying silent after Iranian officials disclosed that the Islamic Republic spent a recent payment by the United States of $1.7 billion in taxpayer funds to expand and build-up its military, according to comments provided to the Washington Free Beacon. ``The Obama administration earlier this year paid Iran $1.7 billion from a U.S. taxpayer-funded account in order to settle decades-old legal disputes with the Islamic Republic.'' Never mind that our American citizens that were taken hostage have never been allowed to collect properly on the damages done by this regime in Iran. Yes, it was Ayatollah Khomeini instead of Khamenei, but these same hoodlums that are running Iran, same type of thinking, were the ones this administration provided $1.7 billion. Instead of taking care of the American citizens that this radical Islamist regime in Iran, after they attacked our Embassy, took our hostages, held them for over a year, and we pay them? It is consistent, I understand, with the apology mentality that leaders in this country have. Maybe the world will be so much better if we are not a superpower, we cut our military to pre-World War II levels, which is happening, and then we give Iran, that hates us, says very clearly they are going to destroy us and our way of life and our freedoms, we give them $1.7 billion to build up their military while we are breaking down ours. I keep going back to the comment by a gentleman, African, named Ebenezer from Togo, when I was over there with the Mercy Ship, provided incredible health care to the people of Togo, Lome, there in West Africa. And at the end of my week there, he and other Africans--these were not African Americans. These were Africans. But they also happened to be fellow Christians. After a lovely meeting with them, Ebenezer spoke, and he said: Look. Basically, he said: We were so excited when you elected your first African American--or ``Black President,'' I believe he said--but since then, we have seen America get weaker and weaker. And the reason we all wanted to meet with you is because, you know, we're Christians. We know where we're going when we die. But our only hope in this life for a peaceful life is if America is strong, because as America gets weaker, we suffer more. We have seen that around the world. I have been to Nigeria and wept with mothers whose children were kidnapped by radical Islamists. They know that, as America has not responded to the radical Islam in Nigeria and helped them as we could, they have suffered mightily. {time} 1400 Yet, this administration, from what has come out of Nigeria, has said: Look, we will help you a little more. We will really be able to help you with Boko Haram, but you have to start paying for abortions, and you have to start having same-sex marriage. We don't care if it violates your religious convictions because that is what we want you to do. They are suffering there. They are suffering in all parts of Africa, many parts of Africa, because this administration has not been the force for good; it has been a force for weakness. Now this story from The Washington Post, Adam Goldman and Missy Ryan, June 8: ``At least 12 released Guantanamo detainees implicated in attacks on Americans.'' The article says: ``The Obama administration believes that at least 12 detainees''--and this is the Obama administration themselves. This isn't Louie Gohmert. This is ``the Obama administration believes that at least 12 detainees released from the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have launched attacks against U.S. or allied forces in Afghanistan, killing about a half-dozen Americans, according to current and former U.S. officials.'' It goes on to explain how these former Guantanamo Bay detainees [[Page H3701]] have been killing Americans in Afghanistan. This is no surprise to some of us who have been saying--when these people were involved in plotting and killing Americans before they were detained, and they have even made statements in detention that they can't wait to get out so they can kill more Americans, at some point even if they say, Okay, I will sign where you want me to, just let me go, who is surprised when they go back on their word like North Korea, go back on their word like the radical Islamist leaders in Iran as distinguished with so many Iranians who want to be rid of the radical Islamist leaders? But who can be surprised that they would actually go back to killing Americans? That is why so many of us have been saying--a majority in this House--we are not going to let you close Guantanamo. We have made it against the law for him to release people unless certain things were done. And he violated that--the President did--when he made the deal for what is apparently a United States Army deserter, it certainly appears, and he let five of the worst murderers go without following the law that was set out for the President. Now it has been substantiated. We know people that have been released from Guantanamo have been killing Americans. So one thing we know also is when a nation's enemies see that that nation's strongest ally is pulling away from that enemy, it is provocative. They act against that nation. So when that nation is Israel, and the appearance to the world is that the United States is pulling back from our close alliance and friendship with Israel, is it any wonder that Israel's biggest and most hateful enemies would be moving against Israel? Terrorists have, once again, been inspired to go on killing sprees in Israel despite the Israelis doing everything they can to stop the carnage. As Prime Minister Netanyahu has said, I believe he even said it in this Chamber as he stood here facing Moses, our greatest known lawgiver of all time, standing, by the way--and I mentioned this to Prime Minister Netanyahu as he came down the aisle in May of 2011: Don't forget, while you are standing, speaking to us, our national motto will be right above your head. He started to look up, and then he didn't even have to look up because he obviously knew what was up there. He looked me in the eye and said: I had already thought about that. So as he stood here, In God We Trust above his head, looking at the greatest lawgiver in the history of mankind, Moses--most of us think he had 10 good commandments. I think our Supreme Court would probably say maybe five or six. But he warned us what was happening in the realm of radical Islam, what would be happening to Israel, and what would be happening to what they call the Great Satan, America. People in this administration did not listen. Americans have spoken out loudly during the primary season about this idea of refugees who cannot be properly vetted, because we don't know really who they are and where they are coming from. As FBI Director Comey testified in front of our Judiciary Committee: We will vet them, but we have got nothing to vet with. At least in Iraq, we had Iraq's records on who had criminal convictions, who had arrests, and who had things in their record. We got no records from Syria and some of these other places. We don't know who they are. We don't know how criminal they are. We don't know how radical Islamist they are. So many have been warning, and the American people have been warning through the primary season, and this article substantiates, from June 10, ``Refugees Angry Over Skimpy Ramadan Meals Set Shelter on Fire, Police Say.'' This is from FOX News. It says: ``A pair of North African refugees reportedly set a German shelter on fire Tuesday because they were angry the special Ramadan meals there weren't up to snuff. ``Investigators told the BBC that the men--who were not fasting at the shelter in Dusseldorf--had complained their lunch portions were too small.'' Since they weren't observing the fast, they wanted more food. ``The fire burned the facility to the ground, causing $11 million in damages.'' The 26-year-old North African told reporters: We had to do it. We had to burn it down so things would change. So the question remains as more and more refugees are brought into this country against the will of the majority of the American people: How many facilities are going to be burned in America? How many more Americans are going to be killed on our own soil because the State Department and the Homeland Security Department are not properly vetting? Our friend--and, in my mind, hero--Phil Haney, who worked for the Department of Homeland Security, had thousands of entries that Janet Napolitano said: We tried to connect the dots. They deleted thousands of those dots. Why? Because this administration apparently doesn't want the public to know or the next administration to find out that many of the people they consult with and consort with have ties to terrorists. They deleted so many thousands of the dots in our system. We are at risk, and the FBI director--I respect him--James Comey, said Tuesday: ``The Islamic State group is currently the main threat facing the United States, both in its efforts to recruit fighters to join its members overseas and to have others carry out violence in America.'' He said: ``The Islamic State group poses a third potential threat: a `terrorist diaspora' that he said will eventually flow out of Syria and Iraq and end up in Western Europe, where members will have easy access to the United States. `` `There's three prongs to this ISIL threat,' Comey said. `The recruitment to travel, the recruitment to violence in place, and then what you saw a preview of in Brussels and in Paris--hardened fighters coming out, looking to kill people.' ``He said officials are `laser-focused on that.' '' We know some officials like him are focused on that, but we also know there are others in the administration who are meeting with people that the Justice Department under President Bush made very clear in their pleadings were coconspirators in support for terrorism. That included the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CAIR. Then we hear about our friends at the Council on American-Islamic Relations when we see the article that just this week CAIR is joking around about medicating Americans against Islamophobia. So that article from Virginia Hale, 9 June, Breitbart, talks about the jokes by the ``Muslim Brotherhood-linked Council on American- Islamic Relations advises that anyone who harbors `intolerance' towards Muslims, or who believes large numbers of the religion's adherents could pose a danger to the U.S., to take anti-Islamophobia medication for their `unthinking bigotry.' '' Is it really bigotry when you are not prejudiced against Muslims, you have many Muslim friends, but you know there is a part of Islamists and there is a part of Muslims who are radical Islamists who want to kill you, destroy your country, destroy Christianity, and destroy Jews--kill all of them? Is it really bigotry to say that we would really like to stop them before they destroy America, kill all Americans, kill all Christians in the world, and kill all Jews in the world, that we would really like to stop that? Is that really bigotry? Because I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that what that is--if you are an American--is love of country. We have had Americans--and I hope and pray still--well, no. I know we have Americans who still have what Jesus, who laid down His life for us, said is the greatest love anyone could ever have, that someone would lay down their life for others. He knew what that was. He did it. We have had so many Americans do that. But because of the lunacy that is occurring now in the administration, in the State Department, in homeland security, and in our military, Americans are being killed and are going to be killed. If that is not enough, this article from TownHall, Matt Vespa, June 3: ``Syrian Refugees Pushed Sweden's Welfare State to the Brink of Collapse.'' Very interesting. Osama bin Laden had an interesting statement at one time about how very cheaply they were [[Page H3702]] able to kill 3,000 Americans on 9/11, but that the best part even beyond killing 3,000 Americans was that they cost us billions and maybe trillions of dollars with a very, very small investment to killing Americans on 9/11, and that if they will keep having projects like that, they can break us financially. It appears that with decisions in this administration, they are on their way to doing that. If that is not enough, this administration had the VA announce that the Department of Veterans Affairs has now proposed covering transition-related surgeries for transgender veterans in the near future under a proposed rule change. I know that the people making this decision don't want more veterans killing themselves. But as Dr. Paul McHugh, the former head of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, now retired, was still working with them--but one transgender gentleman that had had the sex change in his forties had told me Dr. McHugh knows more about transgender than anybody. Dr. McHugh has not made that claim. He is a very humble gentleman. He is a brilliant man. He cites in his article printed in The Wall Street Journal about a 2011 study at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden produced the most illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered evidence that should give advocates pause. He is talking about advocates for transgender agenda that is even being pushed here in Congress. {time} 1415 And he says: ``The long-term study--up to 30 years--followed 324 people who had sex-reassignment surgery. The study revealed that beginning about 10 years after having the surgery, the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. Most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable nontransgender population. This disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery. The high suicide rate certainly challenges the surgery prescription.'' So for those in the VA who think a sex change operation is a good idea, Mr. Speaker, I hope they will look at the number of veterans that are killing themselves--higher rates than any time in previous eras of American history--and they will look at how many veterans are dying without the treatment they need, the veterans that are in long timelines to get the treatment they need to stay alive, and those who are dying waiting for the treatment they need. Do you really want to have 20 times more veterans killing themselves? Is that where you want the VA money being spent, so that we can have 20 times the suicide rate that we currently have? ``Forbid it, Almighty God,'' as Patrick Henry once said. And now the administration wants to take away parents' choices of decisions for their kids, wants to take our choices away that the First Amendment assures us that we have the right to freedom of religion. There is no right to freedom from religion, but there is a right of freedom of religion; and those rights are being taken away, even as they were from the Little Sisters of the Poor. Do we want to allow these rights to continue to be taken at the cost of American lives, as we have seen resulting from people released at Guantanamo Bay, resulting from the ridiculous rules that are given to our military members? They are told they can't fire on people unless they are fired at and they can be assured no civilian will get hit. The rules of engagement are ridiculous under this administration. So many rules are costing American lives. It is time to bring it all home and to understand the words of Ebenezer in Africa that, when America gets weaker, people around the world suffer. They understand that around the world. Freedom-loving people understand around the world when America gets weaker, they suffer. America has been a gift to the world. Mr. Speaker, you know it, I know it, and I hope and pray more in the administration will realize it before it is too late. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3699-H3702] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUANTANAMO BAY The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Since the history of more civilized warfare--if we can call it such, because war is truly hell--noble nations played by rules that said, if you capture someone who is part of the group at war with you, then you hold them as prisoners in a humane fashion until such time as the group of which they are a part agrees that they are no longer at war. If the war drags on 15, 20, 30, 50 years, it is not the fault of the country that captures people at war with them, because that country did not start the war. In this case, the radical Islamists have had this small part of Islam since its beginning and felt like the way to be truly religiously Islamic is to kill anybody that stands in your way of having an international caliphate and forcing everyone in the world to bow before Allah and Islam, in the name of Islam. {time} 1345 It is not our fault if they will not say we are no longer at war with you, because once that happens, then you release those prisoners who were part of the group that was at war with you. And if some of them can be proven to be guilty of actual war crimes against humanity, then you take them to trial, and you try to convict them. And if you do, as we saw after World War II, if they are convicted and sentenced to death, that occurs. If they are sentenced to prison, that is on top of the years that we waited while their group continued to be at war with us. That is under the civilized rules of warfare. Guantanamo Bay, I can say, having been there more than once, and also having toured many State and Federal prisons, has provided the most humane treatment I have ever seen a group of prisoners get. For example, in a Texas prison, if you throw urine or feces on a guard, you will suffer consequences for that decision. I found out on one of my trips to Guantanamo Bay prison that when, as often happens, an inmate figures out a way to throw urine or feces on one of our military member guards, that because we don't want to be perceived as having some mean-spirited prison, we take away a couple of their movie- watching hours during some day to teach them a lesson. And there have been instances where, when they didn't like the movies being presented, perhaps they hadn't been screened properly enough, maybe some woman exposed a bare arm and that offended somebody, well, there was uproar, problems. But if somebody committed a really egregious crime of assaulting one of our guards, then they might actually lose some of their time outside for a day or two. It bothered me greatly to find out that the guards were not allowed to even say anything when someone threw urine or feces on them who was an inmate at Guantanamo Bay; because one such United States military member, I think they said he was a minority member of our United States military, had feces thrown on him, and he angrily said a name, and he received an article 15 non-judicial punishment, and he was punished for simply saying something back after he had feces thrown on him. Well, that ought to be the least of the problems. And I couldn't believe one of our military members who had been assaulted in such a despicable manner was the one punished for saying something back to the inmate that threw feces on him. But the President is determined to follow through with this same kind of policy idea that he has had since the beginning, when he had his apology tour going throughout the Middle East, apologizing in Egypt, apologizing around the world for America, who has been the only country that I can find in history that has shed so much precious American blood, so much blood of our Americans for other people's freedom. We didn't owe anybody an apology, not for that. And there is this mentality among some liberals like our President that the world will be so much safer and a so much better place to live if America were brought down and were not a superpower and you let other countries be superpowers, like, for example, Iran. Let's give Iran $100 billion, $150 billion access to that, and let's let them become a superpower, and we will negotiate a deal that, hopefully, will prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon while President Obama is in office. And then who cares what happens after that; right? But the deal that was negotiated pretty well assures that Iran will have nuclear weapons. It is just a matter of when. And now we know that Iran has repeatedly broken their agreement and we know that this administration, as we found out, this administration actually manipulated video to try to cover up just how bad the deal was that this State Department was negotiating. [[Page H3700]] I didn't really need to see the story to know this kind of stuff was going on. When I saw that Wendy Sherman was maybe chief negotiator, working with the Secretary of State, who was also part of the glorious deal that the Clinton administration, along with Madeleine Albright, negotiated with North Korea, basically--and this is my translation of the deal--but, okay. We are going to make sure that you have nuclear power, and we will make sure you have got nuclear fuel, you have got everything you need to make a nuclear weapon so long as you will sign an agreement saying that you are not going to use it to create a nuclear weapon. You can't help but think of all the snickering that went on in North Korea, especially by Kim Jong-il: Wow, all they want is my signature and they will give us what we need to make a nuclear weapon? Sure. Where do I sign? I mean, it really reminded me of the story Jeff Foxworthy told about, before he made money as a comedian, he was down on his luck. A guy shows up at the door, says, ``I'm here to repossess your car.'' ``Oh, please don't take my car. If you take my car, I can't make it to any of my gigs. I can't make money, and then I have no chance of paying for the car. So please, don't take my car.'' ``I'm sorry, Mr. Foxworthy. I'm here, and I'm supposed to either leave with your car or with cash payment or with a check.'' And Foxworthy basically said, ``A check? You'll take a check? I didn't know you'd take a check.'' ``Yeah, how much do you want me to make it out for?'' ``I'm glad to write you a check. Sure, you just tell me.'' And then he signs and gives the check and he keeps his car. That had to be the kind of mentality. You mean, you will give us everything we need in North Korea to have nuclear weapons, and all we have to do is sign and you're good with that? Wow. Okay. Let us sign. So they signed. We make sure they have what they need for nuclear weapons in the name of giving them nuclear power, and sure enough--very expectedly by some of us because it was such a stupid thing to do, the Clinton administration, with Wendy Sherman right there in the negotiations--we gave them the ability to create nuclear weapons, which they have done. The same way with Iran. Their leaders must have been laughing behind our backs, because we know what they were saying publicly while they were still continuing to say ``death to America,'' still calling us the ``Great Satan,'' still saying they weren't going to abide by any agreement, that the United States would never get them to do what we wanted them to. Oh, so while we are telling the public we are not going to go along with any deal we sign, you are still willing to accept our signature on a deal? For sure, we will sign, because even Allah allows us to sign something that is a lie if, in the end, it furthers his kingdom, in their way of thinking. So if we had strong enough leadership in the United States Senate, what would happen would be there would be a call for a vote on the Iran treaty, which it is. It modifies other treaty provisions and, therefore, you can't do that unless it is a treaty, so it is a treaty. The Constitution says that requires two-thirds of the Senate to vote for the treaty in order for it to be ratified. The Senate took up this Corker bill, that turned the Constitution upside down, and said, no, we are going to say it takes two-thirds to vote against a deal; otherwise, it goes forward. Bob Corker is a really nice guy, but, my word, the damage that was done to the Middle East and to the world by the Senate taking an approach to the Iran treaty as if it wasn't really a treaty. There is still time. Take the vote in the Senate. I know that 60 votes are required for cloture; but when Harry Reid felt like getting very liberal judges into Federal courts was more important than the cloture rule, he had 51 Democrats vote to set aside the cloture rule, and they put in the liberal judges they wanted over the Republican objection. This Iran treaty is going to eventually bring so much death and destruction to not only the Middle East, but, as Netanyahu has warned us, they are not preparing those intercontinental ballistic missiles for Israel. Those are for us. They can already hit Israel. They are for us. So what do we see in the news now, other than the fact that Iran-- well, this article says: ``Iran Spends $1.7 Billion in U.S. Taxpayer Funds to Boost Its Military.'' And it says in this June 9 article from Free Beacon, by Adam Kredo: ``The State Department is staying silent after Iranian officials disclosed that the Islamic Republic spent a recent payment by the United States of $1.7 billion in taxpayer funds to expand and build-up its military, according to comments provided to the Washington Free Beacon. ``The Obama administration earlier this year paid Iran $1.7 billion from a U.S. taxpayer-funded account in order to settle decades-old legal disputes with the Islamic Republic.'' Never mind that our American citizens that were taken hostage have never been allowed to collect properly on the damages done by this regime in Iran. Yes, it was Ayatollah Khomeini instead of Khamenei, but these same hoodlums that are running Iran, same type of thinking, were the ones this administration provided $1.7 billion. Instead of taking care of the American citizens that this radical Islamist regime in Iran, after they attacked our Embassy, took our hostages, held them for over a year, and we pay them? It is consistent, I understand, with the apology mentality that leaders in this country have. Maybe the world will be so much better if we are not a superpower, we cut our military to pre-World War II levels, which is happening, and then we give Iran, that hates us, says very clearly they are going to destroy us and our way of life and our freedoms, we give them $1.7 billion to build up their military while we are breaking down ours. I keep going back to the comment by a gentleman, African, named Ebenezer from Togo, when I was over there with the Mercy Ship, provided incredible health care to the people of Togo, Lome, there in West Africa. And at the end of my week there, he and other Africans--these were not African Americans. These were Africans. But they also happened to be fellow Christians. After a lovely meeting with them, Ebenezer spoke, and he said: Look. Basically, he said: We were so excited when you elected your first African American--or ``Black President,'' I believe he said--but since then, we have seen America get weaker and weaker. And the reason we all wanted to meet with you is because, you know, we're Christians. We know where we're going when we die. But our only hope in this life for a peaceful life is if America is strong, because as America gets weaker, we suffer more. We have seen that around the world. I have been to Nigeria and wept with mothers whose children were kidnapped by radical Islamists. They know that, as America has not responded to the radical Islam in Nigeria and helped them as we could, they have suffered mightily. {time} 1400 Yet, this administration, from what has come out of Nigeria, has said: Look, we will help you a little more. We will really be able to help you with Boko Haram, but you have to start paying for abortions, and you have to start having same-sex marriage. We don't care if it violates your religious convictions because that is what we want you to do. They are suffering there. They are suffering in all parts of Africa, many parts of Africa, because this administration has not been the force for good; it has been a force for weakness. Now this story from The Washington Post, Adam Goldman and Missy Ryan, June 8: ``At least 12 released Guantanamo detainees implicated in attacks on Americans.'' The article says: ``The Obama administration believes that at least 12 detainees''--and this is the Obama administration themselves. This isn't Louie Gohmert. This is ``the Obama administration believes that at least 12 detainees released from the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have launched attacks against U.S. or allied forces in Afghanistan, killing about a half-dozen Americans, according to current and former U.S. officials.'' It goes on to explain how these former Guantanamo Bay detainees [[Page H3701]] have been killing Americans in Afghanistan. This is no surprise to some of us who have been saying--when these people were involved in plotting and killing Americans before they were detained, and they have even made statements in detention that they can't wait to get out so they can kill more Americans, at some point even if they say, Okay, I will sign where you want me to, just let me go, who is surprised when they go back on their word like North Korea, go back on their word like the radical Islamist leaders in Iran as distinguished with so many Iranians who want to be rid of the radical Islamist leaders? But who can be surprised that they would actually go back to killing Americans? That is why so many of us have been saying--a majority in this House--we are not going to let you close Guantanamo. We have made it against the law for him to release people unless certain things were done. And he violated that--the President did--when he made the deal for what is apparently a United States Army deserter, it certainly appears, and he let five of the worst murderers go without following the law that was set out for the President. Now it has been substantiated. We know people that have been released from Guantanamo have been killing Americans. So one thing we know also is when a nation's enemies see that that nation's strongest ally is pulling away from that enemy, it is provocative. They act against that nation. So when that nation is Israel, and the appearance to the world is that the United States is pulling back from our close alliance and friendship with Israel, is it any wonder that Israel's biggest and most hateful enemies would be moving against Israel? Terrorists have, once again, been inspired to go on killing sprees in Israel despite the Israelis doing everything they can to stop the carnage. As Prime Minister Netanyahu has said, I believe he even said it in this Chamber as he stood here facing Moses, our greatest known lawgiver of all time, standing, by the way--and I mentioned this to Prime Minister Netanyahu as he came down the aisle in May of 2011: Don't forget, while you are standing, speaking to us, our national motto will be right above your head. He started to look up, and then he didn't even have to look up because he obviously knew what was up there. He looked me in the eye and said: I had already thought about that. So as he stood here, In God We Trust above his head, looking at the greatest lawgiver in the history of mankind, Moses--most of us think he had 10 good commandments. I think our Supreme Court would probably say maybe five or six. But he warned us what was happening in the realm of radical Islam, what would be happening to Israel, and what would be happening to what they call the Great Satan, America. People in this administration did not listen. Americans have spoken out loudly during the primary season about this idea of refugees who cannot be properly vetted, because we don't know really who they are and where they are coming from. As FBI Director Comey testified in front of our Judiciary Committee: We will vet them, but we have got nothing to vet with. At least in Iraq, we had Iraq's records on who had criminal convictions, who had arrests, and who had things in their record. We got no records from Syria and some of these other places. We don't know who they are. We don't know how criminal they are. We don't know how radical Islamist they are. So many have been warning, and the American people have been warning through the primary season, and this article substantiates, from June 10, ``Refugees Angry Over Skimpy Ramadan Meals Set Shelter on Fire, Police Say.'' This is from FOX News. It says: ``A pair of North African refugees reportedly set a German shelter on fire Tuesday because they were angry the special Ramadan meals there weren't up to snuff. ``Investigators told the BBC that the men--who were not fasting at the shelter in Dusseldorf--had complained their lunch portions were too small.'' Since they weren't observing the fast, they wanted more food. ``The fire burned the facility to the ground, causing $11 million in damages.'' The 26-year-old North African told reporters: We had to do it. We had to burn it down so things would change. So the question remains as more and more refugees are brought into this country against the will of the majority of the American people: How many facilities are going to be burned in America? How many more Americans are going to be killed on our own soil because the State Department and the Homeland Security Department are not properly vetting? Our friend--and, in my mind, hero--Phil Haney, who worked for the Department of Homeland Security, had thousands of entries that Janet Napolitano said: We tried to connect the dots. They deleted thousands of those dots. Why? Because this administration apparently doesn't want the public to know or the next administration to find out that many of the people they consult with and consort with have ties to terrorists. They deleted so many thousands of the dots in our system. We are at risk, and the FBI director--I respect him--James Comey, said Tuesday: ``The Islamic State group is currently the main threat facing the United States, both in its efforts to recruit fighters to join its members overseas and to have others carry out violence in America.'' He said: ``The Islamic State group poses a third potential threat: a `terrorist diaspora' that he said will eventually flow out of Syria and Iraq and end up in Western Europe, where members will have easy access to the United States. `` `There's three prongs to this ISIL threat,' Comey said. `The recruitment to travel, the recruitment to violence in place, and then what you saw a preview of in Brussels and in Paris--hardened fighters coming out, looking to kill people.' ``He said officials are `laser-focused on that.' '' We know some officials like him are focused on that, but we also know there are others in the administration who are meeting with people that the Justice Department under President Bush made very clear in their pleadings were coconspirators in support for terrorism. That included the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CAIR. Then we hear about our friends at the Council on American-Islamic Relations when we see the article that just this week CAIR is joking around about medicating Americans against Islamophobia. So that article from Virginia Hale, 9 June, Breitbart, talks about the jokes by the ``Muslim Brotherhood-linked Council on American- Islamic Relations advises that anyone who harbors `intolerance' towards Muslims, or who believes large numbers of the religion's adherents could pose a danger to the U.S., to take anti-Islamophobia medication for their `unthinking bigotry.' '' Is it really bigotry when you are not prejudiced against Muslims, you have many Muslim friends, but you know there is a part of Islamists and there is a part of Muslims who are radical Islamists who want to kill you, destroy your country, destroy Christianity, and destroy Jews--kill all of them? Is it really bigotry to say that we would really like to stop them before they destroy America, kill all Americans, kill all Christians in the world, and kill all Jews in the world, that we would really like to stop that? Is that really bigotry? Because I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that what that is--if you are an American--is love of country. We have had Americans--and I hope and pray still--well, no. I know we have Americans who still have what Jesus, who laid down His life for us, said is the greatest love anyone could ever have, that someone would lay down their life for others. He knew what that was. He did it. We have had so many Americans do that. But because of the lunacy that is occurring now in the administration, in the State Department, in homeland security, and in our military, Americans are being killed and are going to be killed. If that is not enough, this article from TownHall, Matt Vespa, June 3: ``Syrian Refugees Pushed Sweden's Welfare State to the Brink of Collapse.'' Very interesting. Osama bin Laden had an interesting statement at one time about how very cheaply they were [[Page H3702]] able to kill 3,000 Americans on 9/11, but that the best part even beyond killing 3,000 Americans was that they cost us billions and maybe trillions of dollars with a very, very small investment to killing Americans on 9/11, and that if they will keep having projects like that, they can break us financially. It appears that with decisions in this administration, they are on their way to doing that. If that is not enough, this administration had the VA announce that the Department of Veterans Affairs has now proposed covering transition-related surgeries for transgender veterans in the near future under a proposed rule change. I know that the people making this decision don't want more veterans killing themselves. But as Dr. Paul McHugh, the former head of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, now retired, was still working with them--but one transgender gentleman that had had the sex change in his forties had told me Dr. McHugh knows more about transgender than anybody. Dr. McHugh has not made that claim. He is a very humble gentleman. He is a brilliant man. He cites in his article printed in The Wall Street Journal about a 2011 study at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden produced the most illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered evidence that should give advocates pause. He is talking about advocates for transgender agenda that is even being pushed here in Congress. {time} 1415 And he says: ``The long-term study--up to 30 years--followed 324 people who had sex-reassignment surgery. The study revealed that beginning about 10 years after having the surgery, the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. Most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable nontransgender population. This disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery. The high suicide rate certainly challenges the surgery prescription.'' So for those in the VA who think a sex change operation is a good idea, Mr. Speaker, I hope they will look at the number of veterans that are killing themselves--higher rates than any time in previous eras of American history--and they will look at how many veterans are dying without the treatment they need, the veterans that are in long timelines to get the treatment they need to stay alive, and those who are dying waiting for the treatment they need. Do you really want to have 20 times more veterans killing themselves? Is that where you want the VA money being spent, so that we can have 20 times the suicide rate that we currently have? ``Forbid it, Almighty God,'' as Patrick Henry once said. And now the administration wants to take away parents' choices of decisions for their kids, wants to take our choices away that the First Amendment assures us that we have the right to freedom of religion. There is no right to freedom from religion, but there is a right of freedom of religion; and those rights are being taken away, even as they were from the Little Sisters of the Poor. Do we want to allow these rights to continue to be taken at the cost of American lives, as we have seen resulting from people released at Guantanamo Bay, resulting from the ridiculous rules that are given to our military members? They are told they can't fire on people unless they are fired at and they can be assured no civilian will get hit. The rules of engagement are ridiculous under this administration. So many rules are costing American lives. It is time to bring it all home and to understand the words of Ebenezer in Africa that, when America gets weaker, people around the world suffer. They understand that around the world. Freedom-loving people understand around the world when America gets weaker, they suffer. America has been a gift to the world. Mr. Speaker, you know it, I know it, and I hope and pray more in the administration will realize it before it is too late. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3699-H3702] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUANTANAMO BAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, there is an issue we have been talking about on the Republican side for quite a bit, and I think some of my Democratic friends realize how serious an issue this is because they care about our military members. The President of the United States promised, ill-advisedly, before he was ever elected, that he was going to close the Guantanamo Bay facility that housed the worst of the worst terrorists wanting to kill Americans and destroy our way of life. Well, he found out right after he took office that you just can't do that because it is going to put American lives at risk. There is a reason they are being held there. And it violates no rules of law when it comes to war, because war is a little different. Since civilized society came along in the history of mankind, things improved for prisoners of war. Before there was a civilized society, when one group warred against another, they would either kill them or make them slaves. What occurred was pretty gruesome. In civilized history, when one group says, ``We are at war with this other group,'' then the other group either responds by defending themselves or they are overtaken by the evildoers--in this case, radical Islamists.

I know that 60 votes are required for cloture; but when Harry Reid felt like getting very liberal judges into Federal courts was more important than the cloture rule, he had 51 Democrats vote to set aside the cloture rule, and they put in the liberal judges they wanted over the Republican objection. This Iran treaty is going to eventually bring so much death and destruction to not only the Middle East, but, as Netanyahu has warned us, they are not preparing those intercontinental ballistic missiles for Israel. Those are for us. They can already hit Israel. They are for us. So what do we see in the news now, other than the fact that Iran-- well, this article says: ``Iran Spends $1.7 Billion in U.S. Taxpayer Funds to Boost Its Military.'' And it says in this June 9 article from Free Beacon, by Adam Kredo: ``The State Department is staying silent after Iranian officials disclosed that the Islamic Republic spent a recent payment by the United States of $1.7 billion in taxpayer funds to expand and build-up its military, according to comments provided to the Washington Free Beacon. ``The Obama administration earlier this year paid Iran $1.7 billion from a U.S. taxpayer-funded account in order to settle decades-old legal disputes with the Islamic Republic.'' Never mind that our American citizens that were taken hostage have never been allowed to collect properly on the damages done by this regime in Iran. Yes, it was Ayatollah Khomeini instead of Khamenei, but these same hoodlums that are running Iran, same type of thinking, were the ones this administration provided $1.7 billion. Instead of taking care of the American citizens that this radical Islamist regime in Iran, after they attacked our Embassy, took our hostages, held them for over a year, and we pay them? It is consistent, I understand, with the apology mentality that leaders in this country have. Maybe the world will be so much better if we are not a superpower, we cut our military to pre-World War II levels, which is happening, and then we give Iran, that hates us, says very clearly they are going to destroy us and our way of life and our freedoms, we give them $1.7 billion to build up their military while we are breaking down ours. I keep going back to the comment by a gentleman, African, named Ebenezer from Togo, when I was over there with the Mercy Ship, provided incredible health care to the people of Togo, Lome, there in West Africa. And at the end of my week there, he and other Africans--these were not African Americans. These were Africans. But they also happened to be fellow Christians. After a lovely meeting with them, Ebenezer spoke, and he said: Look. Basically, he said: We were so excited when you elected your first African American--or ``Black President,'' I believe he said--but since then, we have seen America get weaker and weaker. And the reason we all wanted to meet with you is because, you know, we're Christians. We know where we're going when we die. But our only hope in this life for a peaceful life is if America is strong, because as America gets weaker, we suffer more. We have seen that around the world. I have been to Nigeria and wept with mothers whose children were kidnapped by radical Islamists. They know that, as America has not responded to the radical Islam in Nigeria and helped them as we could, they have suffered mightily. {time} 1400 Yet, this administration, from what has come out of Nigeria, has said: Look, we will help you a little more. We will really be able to help you with Boko Haram, but you have to start paying for abortions, and you have to start having same-sex marriage. We don't care if it violates your religious convictions because that is what we want you to do. They are suffering there. They are suffering in all parts of Africa, many parts of Africa, because this administration has not been the force for good; it has been a force for weakness. Now this story from The Washington Post, Adam Goldman and Missy Ryan, June 8: ``At least 12 released Guantanamo detainees implicated in attacks on Americans.'' The article says: ``The Obama administration believes that at least 12 detainees''--and this is the Obama administration themselves. This isn't Louie Gohmert. This is ``the Obama administration believes that at least 12 detainees released from the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have launched attacks against U.S. or allied forces in Afghanistan, killing about a half-dozen Americans, according to current and former U.S. officials.'' It goes on to explain how these former Guantanamo Bay detainees [[Page H3701]] have been killing Americans in Afghanistan. This is no surprise to some of us who have been saying--when these people were involved in plotting and killing Americans before they were detained, and they have even made statements in detention that they can't wait to get out so they can kill more Americans, at some point even if they say, Okay, I will sign where you want me to, just let me go, who is surprised when they go back on their word like North Korea, go back on their word like the radical Islamist leaders in Iran as distinguished with so many Iranians who want to be rid of the radical Islamist leaders? But who can be surprised that they would actually go back to killing Americans? That is why so many of us have been saying--a majority in this House--we are not going to let you close Guantanamo. We have made it against the law for him to release people unless certain things were done. And he violated that--the President did--when he made the deal for what is apparently a United States Army deserter, it certainly appears, and he let five of the worst murderers go without following the law that was set out for the President. Now it has been substantiated. We know people that have been released from Guantanamo have been killing Americans. So one thing we know also is when a nation's enemies see that that nation's strongest ally is pulling away from that enemy, it is provocative. They act against that nation. So when that nation is Israel, and the appearance to the world is that the United States is pulling back from our close alliance and friendship with Israel, is it any wonder that Israel's biggest and most hateful enemies would be moving against Israel? Terrorists have, once again, been inspired to go on killing sprees in Israel despite the Israelis doing everything they can to stop the carnage. As Prime Minister Netanyahu has said, I believe he even said it in this Chamber as he stood here facing Moses, our greatest known lawgiver of all time, standing, by the way--and I mentioned this to Prime Minister Netanyahu as he came down the aisle in May of 2011: Don't forget, while you are standing, speaking to us, our national motto will be right above your head. He started to look up, and then he didn't even have to look up because he obviously knew what was up there. He looked me in the eye and said: I had already thought about that. So as he stood here, In God We Trust above his head, looking at the greatest lawgiver in the history of mankind, Moses--most of us think he had 10 good commandments. I think our Supreme Court would probably say maybe five or six. But he warned us what was happening in the realm of radical Islam, what would be happening to Israel, and what would be happening to what they call the Great Satan, America. People in this administration did not listen. Americans have spoken out loudly during the primary season about this idea of refugees who cannot be properly vetted, because we don't know really who they are and where they are coming from. As FBI Director Comey testified in front of our Judiciary Committee: We will vet them, but we have got nothing to vet with. At least in Iraq, we had Iraq's records on who had criminal convictions, who had arrests, and who had things in their record. We got no records from Syria and some of these other places. We don't know who they are. We don't know how criminal they are. We don't know how radical Islamist they are. So many have been warning, and the American people have been warning through the primary season, and this article substantiates, from June 10, ``Refugees Angry Over Skimpy Ramadan Meals Set Shelter on Fire, Police Say.'' This is from FOX News. It says: ``A pair of North African refugees reportedly set a German shelter on fire Tuesday because they were angry the special Ramadan meals there weren't up to snuff. ``Investigators told the BBC that the men--who were not fasting at the shelter in Dusseldorf--had complained their lunch portions were too small.'' Since they weren't observing the fast, they wanted more food. ``The fire burned the facility to the ground, causing $11 million in damages.'' The 26-year-old North African told reporters: We had to do it. We had to burn it down so things would change. So the question remains as more and more refugees are brought into this country against the will of the majority of the American people: How many facilities are going to be burned in America? How many more Americans are going to be killed on our own soil because the State Department and the Homeland Security Department are not properly vetting? Our friend--and, in my mind, hero--Phil Haney, who worked for the Department of Homeland Security, had thousands of entries that Janet Napolitano said: We tried to connect the dots. They deleted thousands of those dots. Why? Because this administration apparently doesn't want the public to know or the next administration to find out that many of the people they consult with and consort with have ties to terrorists. They deleted so many thousands of the dots in our system. We are at risk, and the FBI director--I respect him--James Comey, said Tuesday: ``The Islamic State group is currently the main threat facing the United States, both in its efforts to recruit fighters to join its members overseas and to have others carry out violence in America.'' He said: ``The Islamic State group poses a third potential threat: a `terrorist diaspora' that he said will eventually flow out of Syria and Iraq and end up in Western Europe, where members will have easy access to the United States. `` `There's three prongs to this ISIL threat,' Comey said. `The recruitment to travel, the recruitment to violence in place, and then what you saw a preview of in Brussels and in Paris--hardened fighters coming out, looking to kill people.' ``He said officials are `laser-focused on that.' '' We know some officials like him are focused on that, but we also know there are others in the administration who are meeting with people that the Justice Department under President Bush made very clear in their pleadings were coconspirators in support for terrorism. That included the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CAIR. Then we hear about our friends at the Council on American-Islamic Relations when we see the article that just this week CAIR is joking around about medicating Americans against Islamophobia. So that article from Virginia Hale, 9 June, Breitbart, talks about the jokes by the ``Muslim Brotherhood-linked Council on American- Islamic Relations advises that anyone who harbors `intolerance' towards Muslims, or who believes large numbers of the religion's adherents could pose a danger to the U.S., to take anti-Islamophobia medication for their `unthinking bigotry.' '' Is it really bigotry when you are not prejudiced against Muslims, you have many Muslim friends, but you know there is a part of Islamists and there is a part of Muslims who are radical Islamists who want to kill you, destroy your country, destroy Christianity, and destroy Jews--kill all of them? Is it really bigotry to say that we would really like to stop them before they destroy America, kill all Americans, kill all Christians in the world, and kill all Jews in the world, that we would really like to stop that? Is that really bigotry? Because I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that what that is--if you are an American--is love of country. We have had Americans--and I hope and pray still--well, no. I know we have Americans who still have what Jesus, who laid down His life for us, said is the greatest love anyone could ever have, that someone would lay down their life for others. He knew what that was. He did it. We have had so many Americans do that. But because of the lunacy that is occurring now in the administration, in the State Department, in homeland security, and in our military, Americans are being killed and are going to be killed. If that is not enough, this article from TownHall, Matt Vespa, June 3: ``Syrian Refugees Pushed Sweden's Welfare State to the Brink of Collapse.'' Very interesting. Osama bin Laden had an interesting statement at one time about how very cheaply they were [[Page H3702]] able to kill 3,000 Americans on 9/11, but that the best part even beyond killing 3,000 Americans was that they cost us billions and maybe trillions of dollars with a very, very small investment to killing Americans on 9/11, and that if they will keep having projects like that, they can break us financially. It appears that with decisions in this administration, they are on their way to doing that. If that is not enough, this administration had the VA announce that the Department of Veterans Affairs has now proposed covering transition-related surgeries for transgender veterans in the near future under a proposed rule change. I know that the people making this decision don't want more veterans killing themselves. But as Dr. Paul McHugh, the former head of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, now retired, was still working with them--but one transgender gentleman that had had the sex change in his forties had told me Dr. McHugh knows more about transgender than anybody. Dr. McHugh has not made that claim. He is a very humble gentleman. He is a brilliant man. He cites in his article printed in The Wall Street Journal about a 2011 study at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden produced the most illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered evidence that should give advocates pause. He is talking about advocates for transgender agenda that is even being pushed here in Congress. {time} 1415 And he says: ``The long-term study--up to 30 years--followed 324 people who had sex-reassignment surgery. The study revealed that beginning about 10 years after having the surgery, the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. Most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable nontransgender population. This disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery. The high suicide rate certainly challenges the surgery prescription.'' So for those in the VA who think a sex change operation is a good idea, Mr. Speaker, I hope they will look at the number of veterans that are killing themselves--higher rates than any time in previous eras of American history--and they will look at how many veterans are dying without the treatment they need, the veterans that are in long timelines to get the treatment they need to stay alive, and those who are dying waiting for the treatment they need. Do you really want to have 20 times more veterans killing themselves? Is that where you want the VA money being spent, so that we can have 20 times the suicide rate that we currently have? ``Forbid it, Almighty God,'' as Patrick Henry once said. And now the administration wants to take away parents' choices of decisions for their kids, wants to take our choices away that the First Amendment assures us that we have the right to freedom of religion. There is no right to freedom from religion, but there is a right of freedom of religion; and those rights are being taken away, even as they were from the Little Sisters of the Poor. Do we want to allow these rights to continue to be taken at the cost of American lives, as we have seen resulting from people released at Guantanamo Bay, resulting from the ridiculous rules that are given to our military members? They are told they can't fire on people unless they are fired at and they can be assured no civilian will get hit. The rules of engagement are ridiculous under this administration. So many rules are costing American lives. It is time to bring it all home and to understand the words of Ebenezer in Africa that, when America gets weaker, people around the world suffer. They understand that around the world. Freedom-loving people understand around the world when America gets weaker, they suffer. America has been a gift to the world. Mr. Speaker, you know it, I know it, and I hope and pray more in the administration will realize it before it is too late. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_182.csv,26736,26736,26802,"[congressional record volume 162, number 92 (friday, june 10, 2016)] [house] [pages h3699-h3702] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] guantanamo bay the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, there is an issue we have been talking about on the republican side for quite a bit, and i think some of my democratic friends realize how serious an issue this is because they care about our military members. the president of the united states promised, ill-advisedly, before he was ever elected, that he was going to close the guantanamo bay facility that housed the worst of the worst terrorists wanting to kill americans and destroy our way of life. well, he found out right after he took office that you just can't do that because it is going to put american lives at risk. there is a reason they are being held there. and it violates no rules of law when it comes to war, because war is a little different. since civilized society came along in the history of mankind, things improved for prisoners of war. before there was a civilized society, when one group warred against another, they would either kill them or make them slaves. what occurred was pretty gruesome. in civilized history, when one group says, ``we are at war with this other group,'' then the other group either responds by defending themselves or they are overtaken by the evildoers--in this case, radical islamists. since the history of more civilized warfare--if we can call it such, because war is truly hell--noble nations played by rules that said, if you capture someone who is part of the group at war with you, then you hold them as prisoners in a humane fashion until such time as the group of which they are a part agrees that they are no longer at war. if the war drags on 15, 20, 30, 50 years, it is not the fault of the country that captures people at war with them, because that country did not start the war. in this case, the radical islamists have had this small part of islam since its beginning and felt like the way to be truly religiously islamic is to kill anybody that stands in your way of having an international caliphate and forcing everyone in the world to bow before allah and islam, in the name of islam. {time} 1345 it is not our fault if they will not say we are no longer at war with you, because once that happens, then you release those prisoners who were part of the group that was at war with you. and if some of them can be proven to be guilty of actual war crimes against humanity, then you take them to trial, and you try to convict them. and if you do, as we saw after world war ii, if they are convicted and sentenced to death, that occurs. if they are sentenced to prison, that is on top of the years that we waited while their group continued to be at war with us. that is under the civilized rules of warfare. guantanamo bay, i can say, having been there more than once, and also having toured many state and federal prisons, has provided the most humane treatment i have ever seen a group of prisoners get. for example, in a texas prison, if you throw urine or feces on a guard, you will suffer consequences for that decision. i found out on one of my trips to guantanamo bay prison that when, as often happens, an inmate figures out a way to throw urine or feces on one of our military member guards, that because we don't want to be perceived as having some mean-spirited prison, we take away a couple of their movie- watching hours during some day to teach them a lesson. and there have been instances where, when they didn't like the movies being presented, perhaps they hadn't been screened properly enough, maybe some woman exposed a bare arm and that offended somebody, well, there was uproar, problems. but if somebody committed a really egregious crime of assaulting one of our guards, then they might actually lose some of their time outside for a day or two. it bothered me greatly to find out that the guards were not allowed to even say anything when someone threw urine or feces on them who was an inmate at guantanamo bay; because one such united states military member, i think they said he was a minority member of our united states military, had feces thrown on him, and he angrily said a name, and he received an article 15 non-judicial punishment, and he was punished for simply saying something back after he had feces thrown on him. well, that ought to be the least of the problems. and i couldn't believe one of our military members who had been assaulted in such a despicable manner was the one punished for saying something back to the inmate that threw feces on him. but the president is determined to follow through with this same kind of policy idea that he has had since the beginning, when he had his apology tour going throughout the middle east, apologizing in egypt, apologizing around the world for america, who has been the only country that i can find in history that has shed so much precious american blood, so much blood of our americans for other people's freedom. we didn't owe anybody an apology, not for that. and there is this mentality among some liberals like our president that the world will be so much safer and a so much better place to live if america were brought down and were not a superpower and you let other countries be superpowers, like, for example, iran. let's give iran $100 billion, $150 billion access to that, and let's let them become a superpower, and we will negotiate a deal that, hopefully, will prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon while president obama is in office. and then who cares what happens after that; right? but the deal that was negotiated pretty well assures that iran will have nuclear weapons. it is just a matter of when. and now we know that iran has repeatedly broken their agreement and we know that this administration, as we found out, this administration actually manipulated video to try to cover up just how bad the deal was that this state department was negotiating. [[page h3700]] i didn't really need to see the story to know this kind of stuff was going on. when i saw that wendy sherman was maybe chief negotiator, working with the secretary of state, who was also part of the glorious deal that the clinton administration, along with madeleine albright, negotiated with north korea, basically--and this is my translation of the deal--but, okay. we are going to make sure that you have nuclear power, and we will make sure you have got nuclear fuel, you have got everything you need to make a nuclear weapon so long as you will sign an agreement saying that you are not going to use it to create a nuclear weapon. you can't help but think of all the snickering that went on in north korea, especially by kim jong-il: wow, all they want is my signature and they will give us what we need to make a nuclear weapon? sure. where do i sign? i mean, it really reminded me of the story jeff foxworthy told about, before he made money as a comedian, he was down on his luck. a guy shows up at the door, says, ``i'm here to repossess your car.'' ``oh, please don't take my car. if you take my car, i can't make it to any of my gigs. i can't make money, and then i have no chance of paying for the car. so please, don't take my car.'' ``i'm sorry, mr. foxworthy. i'm here, and i'm supposed to either leave with your car or with cash payment or with a check.'' and foxworthy basically said, ``a check? you'll take a check? i didn't know you'd take a check.'' ``yeah, how much do you want me to make it out for?'' ``i'm glad to write you a check. sure, you just tell me.'' and then he signs and gives the check and he keeps his car. that had to be the kind of mentality. you mean, you will give us everything we need in north korea to have nuclear weapons, and all we have to do is sign and you're good with that? wow. okay. let us sign. so they signed. we make sure they have what they need for nuclear weapons in the name of giving them nuclear power, and sure enough--very expectedly by some of us because it was such a stupid thing to do, the clinton administration, with wendy sherman right there in the negotiations--we gave them the ability to create nuclear weapons, which they have done. the same way with iran. their leaders must have been laughing behind our backs, because we know what they were saying publicly while they were still continuing to say ``death to america,'' still calling us the ``great satan,'' still saying they weren't going to abide by any agreement, that the united states would never get them to do what we wanted them to. oh, so while we are telling the public we are not going to go along with any deal we sign, you are still willing to accept our signature on a deal? for sure, we will sign, because even allah allows us to sign something that is a lie if, in the end, it furthers his kingdom, in their way of thinking. so if we had strong enough leadership in the united states senate, what would happen would be there would be a call for a vote on the iran treaty, which it is. it modifies other treaty provisions and, therefore, you can't do that unless it is a treaty, so it is a treaty. the constitution says that requires two-thirds of the senate to vote for the treaty in order for it to be ratified. the senate took up this corker bill, that turned the constitution upside down, and said, no, we are going to say it takes two-thirds to vote against a deal; otherwise, it goes forward. bob corker is a really nice guy, but, my word, the damage that was done to the middle east and to the world by the senate taking an approach to the iran treaty as if it wasn't really a treaty. there is still time. take the vote in the senate. i know that 60 votes are required for cloture; but when harry reid felt like getting very liberal judges into federal courts was more important than the cloture rule, he had 51 democrats vote to set aside the cloture rule, and they put in the liberal judges they wanted over the republican objection. this iran treaty is going to eventually bring so much death and destruction to not only the middle east, but, as netanyahu has warned us, they are not preparing those intercontinental ballistic missiles for israel. those are for us. they can already hit israel. they are for us. so what do we see in the news now, other than the fact that iran-- well, this article says: ``iran spends $1.7 billion in u.s. taxpayer funds to boost its military.'' and it says in this june 9 article from free beacon, by adam kredo: ``the state department is staying silent after iranian officials disclosed that the islamic republic spent a recent payment by the united states of $1.7 billion in taxpayer funds to expand and build-up its military, according to comments provided to the washington free beacon. ``the obama administration earlier this year paid iran $1.7 billion from a u.s. taxpayer-funded account in order to settle decades-old legal disputes with the islamic republic.'' never mind that our american citizens that were taken hostage have never been allowed to collect properly on the damages done by this regime in iran. yes, it was ayatollah khomeini instead of khamenei, but these same hoodlums that are running iran, same type of thinking, were the ones this administration provided $1.7 billion. instead of taking care of the american citizens that this radical islamist regime in iran, after they attacked our embassy, took our hostages, held them for over a year, and we pay them? it is consistent, i understand, with the apology mentality that leaders in this country have. maybe the world will be so much better if we are not a superpower, we cut our military to pre-world war ii levels, which is happening, and then we give iran, that hates us, says very clearly they are going to destroy us and our way of life and our freedoms, we give them $1.7 billion to build up their military while we are breaking down ours. i keep going back to the comment by a gentleman, african, named ebenezer from togo, when i was over there with the mercy ship, provided incredible health care to the people of togo, lome, there in west africa. and at the end of my week there, he and other africans--these were not african americans. these were africans. but they also happened to be fellow christians. after a lovely meeting with them, ebenezer spoke, and he said: look. basically, he said: we were so excited when you elected your first african american--or ``black president,'' i believe he said--but since then, we have seen america get weaker and weaker. and the reason we all wanted to meet with you is because, you know, we're christians. we know where we're going when we die. but our only hope in this life for a peaceful life is if america is strong, because as america gets weaker, we suffer more. we have seen that around the world. i have been to nigeria and wept with mothers whose children were kidnapped by radical islamists. they know that, as america has not responded to the radical islam in nigeria and helped them as we could, they have suffered mightily. {time} 1400 yet, this administration, from what has come out of nigeria, has said: look, we will help you a little more. we will really be able to help you with boko haram, but you have to start paying for abortions, and you have to start having same-sex marriage. we don't care if it violates your religious convictions because that is what we want you to do. they are suffering there. they are suffering in all parts of africa, many parts of africa, because this administration has not been the force for good; it has been a force for weakness. now this story from the washington post, adam goldman and missy ryan, june 8: ``at least 12 released guantanamo detainees implicated in attacks on americans.'' the article says: ``the obama administration believes that at least 12 detainees''--and this is the obama administration themselves. this isn't louie gohmert. this is ``the obama administration believes that at least 12 detainees released from the prison at guantanamo bay, cuba, have launched attacks against u.s. or allied forces in afghanistan, killing about a half-dozen americans, according to current and former u.s. officials.'' it goes on to explain how these former guantanamo bay detainees [[page h3701]] have been killing americans in afghanistan. this is no surprise to some of us who have been saying--when these people were involved in plotting and killing americans before they were detained, and they have even made statements in detention that they can't wait to get out so they can kill more americans, at some point even if they say, okay, i will sign where you want me to, just let me go, who is surprised when they go back on their word like north korea, go back on their word like the radical islamist leaders in iran as distinguished with so many iranians who want to be rid of the radical islamist leaders? but who can be surprised that they would actually go back to killing americans? that is why so many of us have been saying--a majority in this house--we are not going to let you close guantanamo. we have made it against the law for him to release people unless certain things were done. and he violated that--the president did--when he made the deal for what is apparently a united states army deserter, it certainly appears, and he let five of the worst murderers go without following the law that was set out for the president. now it has been substantiated. we know people that have been released from guantanamo have been killing americans. so one thing we know also is when a nation's enemies see that that nation's strongest ally is pulling away from that enemy, it is provocative. they act against that nation. so when that nation is israel, and the appearance to the world is that the united states is pulling back from our close alliance and friendship with israel, is it any wonder that israel's biggest and most hateful enemies would be moving against israel? terrorists have, once again, been inspired to go on killing sprees in israel despite the israelis doing everything they can to stop the carnage. as prime minister netanyahu has said, i believe he even said it in this chamber as he stood here facing moses, our greatest known lawgiver of all time, standing, by the way--and i mentioned this to prime minister netanyahu as he came down the aisle in may of 2011: don't forget, while you are standing, speaking to us, our national motto will be right above your head. he started to look up, and then he didn't even have to look up because he obviously knew what was up there. he looked me in the eye and said: i had already thought about that. so as he stood here, in god we trust above his head, looking at the greatest lawgiver in the history of mankind, moses--most of us think he had 10 good commandments. i think our supreme court would probably say maybe five or six. but he warned us what was happening in the realm of radical islam, what would be happening to israel, and what would be happening to what they call the great satan, america. people in this administration did not listen. americans have spoken out loudly during the primary season about this idea of refugees who cannot be properly vetted, because we don't know really who they are and where they are coming from. as fbi director comey testified in front of our judiciary committee: we will vet them, but we have got nothing to vet with. at least in iraq, we had iraq's records on who had criminal convictions, who had arrests, and who had things in their record. we got no records from syria and some of these other places. we don't know who they are. we don't know how criminal they are. we don't know how radical islamist they are. so many have been warning, and the american people have been warning through the primary season, and this article substantiates, from june 10, ``refugees angry over skimpy ramadan meals set shelter on fire, police say.'' this is from fox news. it says: ``a pair of north african refugees reportedly set a german shelter on fire tuesday because they were angry the special ramadan meals there weren't up to snuff. ``investigators told the bbc that the men--who were not fasting at the shelter in dusseldorf--had complained their lunch portions were too small.'' since they weren't observing the fast, they wanted more food. ``the fire burned the facility to the ground, causing $11 million in damages.'' the 26-year-old north african told reporters: we had to do it. we had to burn it down so things would change. so the question remains as more and more refugees are brought into this country against the will of the majority of the american people: how many facilities are going to be burned in america? how many more americans are going to be killed on our own soil because the state department and the homeland security department are not properly vetting? our friend--and, in my mind, hero--phil haney, who worked for the department of homeland security, had thousands of entries that janet napolitano said: we tried to connect the dots. they deleted thousands of those dots. why? because this administration apparently doesn't want the public to know or the next administration to find out that many of the people they consult with and consort with have ties to terrorists. they deleted so many thousands of the dots in our system. we are at risk, and the fbi director--i respect him--james comey, said tuesday: ``the islamic state group is currently the main threat facing the united states, both in its efforts to recruit fighters to join its members overseas and to have others carry out violence in america.'' he said: ``the islamic state group poses a third potential threat: a `terrorist diaspora' that he said will eventually flow out of syria and iraq and end up in western europe, where members will have easy access to the united states. `` `there's three prongs to this isil threat,' comey said. `the recruitment to travel, the recruitment to violence in place, and then what you saw a preview of in brussels and in paris--hardened fighters coming out, looking to kill people.' ``he said officials are `laser-focused on that.' '' we know some officials like him are focused on that, but we also know there are others in the administration who are meeting with people that the justice department under president bush made very clear in their pleadings were coconspirators in support for terrorism. that included the council on american-islamic relations, cair. then we hear about our friends at the council on american-islamic relations when we see the article that just this week cair is joking around about medicating americans against islamophobia. so that article from virginia hale, 9 june, breitbart, talks about the jokes by the ``muslim brotherhood-linked council on american- islamic relations advises that anyone who harbors `intolerance' towards muslims, or who believes large numbers of the religion's adherents could pose a danger to the u.s., to take anti-islamophobia medication for their `unthinking bigotry.' '' is it really bigotry when you are not prejudiced against muslims, you have many muslim friends, but you know there is a part of islamists and there is a part of muslims who are radical islamists who want to kill you, destroy your country, destroy christianity, and destroy jews--kill all of them? is it really bigotry to say that we would really like to stop them before they destroy america, kill all americans, kill all christians in the world, and kill all jews in the world, that we would really like to stop that? is that really bigotry? because i would submit, mr. speaker, that what that is--if you are an american--is love of country. we have had americans--and i hope and pray still--well, no. i know we have americans who still have what jesus, who laid down his life for us, said is the greatest love anyone could ever have, that someone would lay down their life for others. he knew what that was. he did it. we have had so many americans do that. but because of the lunacy that is occurring now in the administration, in the state department, in homeland security, and in our military, americans are being killed and are going to be killed. if that is not enough, this article from townhall, matt vespa, june 3: ``syrian refugees pushed sweden's welfare state to the brink of collapse.'' very interesting. osama bin laden had an interesting statement at one time about how very cheaply they were [[page h3702]] able to kill 3,000 americans on 9/11, but that the best part even beyond killing 3,000 americans was that they cost us billions and maybe trillions of dollars with a very, very small investment to killing americans on 9/11, and that if they will keep having projects like that, they can break us financially. it appears that with decisions in this administration, they are on their way to doing that. if that is not enough, this administration had the va announce that the department of veterans affairs has now proposed covering transition-related surgeries for transgender veterans in the near future under a proposed rule change. i know that the people making this decision don't want more veterans killing themselves. but as dr. paul mchugh, the former head of psychiatry at johns hopkins, now retired, was still working with them--but one transgender gentleman that had had the sex change in his forties had told me dr. mchugh knows more about transgender than anybody. dr. mchugh has not made that claim. he is a very humble gentleman. he is a brilliant man. he cites in his article printed in the wall street journal about a 2011 study at the karolinska institutet in sweden produced the most illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered evidence that should give advocates pause. he is talking about advocates for transgender agenda that is even being pushed here in congress. {time} 1415 and he says: ``the long-term study--up to 30 years--followed 324 people who had sex-reassignment surgery. the study revealed that beginning about 10 years after having the surgery, the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable nontransgender population. this disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery. the high suicide rate certainly challenges the surgery prescription.'' so for those in the va who think a sex change operation is a good idea, mr. speaker, i hope they will look at the number of veterans that are killing themselves--higher rates than any time in previous eras of american history--and they will look at how many veterans are dying without the treatment they need, the veterans that are in long timelines to get the treatment they need to stay alive, and those who are dying waiting for the treatment they need. do you really want to have 20 times more veterans killing themselves? is that where you want the va money being spent, so that we can have 20 times the suicide rate that we currently have? ``forbid it, almighty god,'' as patrick henry once said. and now the administration wants to take away parents' choices of decisions for their kids, wants to take our choices away that the first amendment assures us that we have the right to freedom of religion. there is no right to freedom from religion, but there is a right of freedom of religion; and those rights are being taken away, even as they were from the little sisters of the poor. do we want to allow these rights to continue to be taken at the cost of american lives, as we have seen resulting from people released at guantanamo bay, resulting from the ridiculous rules that are given to our military members? they are told they can't fire on people unless they are fired at and they can be assured no civilian will get hit. the rules of engagement are ridiculous under this administration. so many rules are costing american lives. it is time to bring it all home and to understand the words of ebenezer in africa that, when america gets weaker, people around the world suffer. they understand that around the world. freedom-loving people understand around the world when america gets weaker, they suffer. america has been a gift to the world. mr. speaker, you know it, i know it, and i hope and pray more in the administration will realize it before it is too late. i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",26736

CREC-2016-06-10-pt1-PgS3787-10,CREC-2016-06-10,114,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3787-S3790] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 2943, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 2943) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. Pending: [[Page S3788]] McCain amendment No. 4607, to amend the provision on share- in-savings contracts. Reed (for Reid) amendment No. 4603 (to amendment No. 4607), to change the enactment date. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I came to the floor yesterday to talk about a truly shameful change that is buried away in this bill. It is a change that would put us on a path to go back on a promise that we made to our servicemembers just 6 months ago and a change, if left unfixed, that will pull the rug out for men and women in the Armed Forces who are prepared to make the highest sacrifice for the country they love. In case any of my colleagues are unaware, a single line in this massive Defense bill on page 1,455, buried in the funding chart, would zero out a new program that is intended to help men and women in our military realize their dream of having a family even if they go on to suffer catastrophic injuries when they are fighting on our behalf. I don't know how this line got in there, I don't know who thought it was a good idea, and I don't know why, but what I do know is this: It is wrong and it has to be fixed. I just want to tell my colleagues that 6 months ago the Pentagon announced a pilot program that would offer servicemembers who are getting ready to deploy an opportunity at cryopreservation--in other words, freezing their eggs or sperm. This new program gave our deploying servicemembers not just the ability to have reproductive options in the event they are grievously injured but some deserved peace of mind. It took us a step forward in the promise we have made to our servicemembers to support them when they sacrifice so much for us, and it meant they wouldn't have to worry about choosing between defending their country or a chance of having a family some day. This new program was met with widespread praise and relief. Men and women who were getting ready to deploy--many of whom were thinking about exploring cryopreservation, using their own money if they could afford it--were assured that their country had their back. While the pilot program was not groundbreaking, these services have long been available in the private sector, and, in fact, fertility preservation techniques have been used by the British Armed Forces for years. It reflected a basic level of respect for servicemembers who are willing to risk suffering catastrophic injuries on our behalf, and it sent a clear message that no matter what happens to them on the battlefield, we will be ready to stand with them with whatever they need. I was hoping this new program was a step we could build on, a move in the right direction, an important part of our larger work to help our warriors who sustained grievous injuries achieve their dream of starting a family, which is why I was so upset when I learned this bill would move us the other way. It would take this promise we just made to our warriors and toss it in the trash. It would be a slap in the face to the men and women who serve us proudly and heroically. And honestly, it is the wrong thing to do. Many people here in the Senate are quick to honor our military with their words, but for the men and women who signed up to fight on our behalf and are looking ahead to potentially massive sacrifices, we owe them so much more than that. We owe them action, respect, and a shot at their dream of having a family. We need to fix this bill. We owe them that much. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to offer Murray amendment No. 4490 relating to fertility treatments and that the Senate vote in relation to this amendment with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reluctantly have to object, and that is because there is an objection on this side, which I have to honor. I thank Senator Murray for her advocacy for the people who are serving in our military in uniform, and this is at least an important aspect of military life, and I thank the Senator for that. I also thank Senator Gillibrand, who will speak in a moment on an issue that has been of great importance to her for several years now. She has been an advocate of this very compelling issue of sexual assault in the military. Unfortunately, we have an objection to all the amendments, and that, in my view, is a great disservice to this body, to the men and women serving in the military, and to the American public. It shouldn't matter whether I happen to agree or disagree with Senator Gillibrand or Senator Murray; they deserve debate and votes, and they are not getting them because of these objections. I wish to also point out that we are working on amendments by Senator Moran, Senator Corker, Senator Gillibrand, and Senator Shaheen. I might point out gratuitously that one of the things I have seen in recent years is involvement on issues that bring new perspectives from people like Senator Gillibrand, Senator Murray, Senator Ayotte, Senator McCaskill, Senator Fischer, and Senator Ernst. They have brought perspectives to our committee and to this body that have been very helpful. All I can say is this: Senator Murray, I will continue to fight to get a vote on your amendment. Mr. President, I reluctantly object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from New York. Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his remarks, and I thank the leaders. I urge my colleagues to allow a vote on my amendment No. 4310. We now know far more about the extent of the military sexual assault problem than we did last year. We have more data, we have reviewed more case files, we heard from more survivors, and it is clear that very little has changed despite the Department of Defense's persistent claims that things are getting better and that they are making progress. When the Department of Defense estimates that 20,000 servicemembers were sexually assaulted this year--the same number as in 2010--that is not progress. When an estimate of 8 out of 10 military sexual assault survivors don't report the crime, that is not progress. When more than half of all retaliation cases--58 percent of them--are perpetrated by someone in the chain of command of the accuser, that is not progress. When the percentage of survivors willing to report openly has declined for the past 5 years, that is not progress. When 62 percent of survivors have experienced retaliation since 2012 and there has not been one prosecution of this enumerated crime, that is not progress. When it is confirmed by the Associated Press that the Pentagon blatantly misled the Senate in order to skew our debate, this is perhaps the ultimate time that they are not making progress. Our military justice system is broken. It is failing our men and women who so bravely serve. No matter how many small reforms we make, as long as commanders with no legal experience are continuing to make these important decisions about violent sexual crimes, we are not going to solve this problem. Our commanders are great at winning wars and training troops. They are not prosecutors. They are not even lawyers. They are warfighters, and their job is to keep our country safe, not make legal judgments about whether to prosecute a rape. Once and for all, let's take this decision to prosecute these crimes and instead give it to trained military prosecutors. Let's give our servicemembers a justice system that is worthy of their service. This is our chance, and I urge everyone to vote yes if we have a vote. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked for S. 2943, notwithstanding rule XXII, that Gillibrand amendment No. 4310, the Military Justice Improvement Act, be considered in order postcloture, and that it be in order to offer amendment No. 4310, and the Senate vote in relation to that amendment with a 60 affirmative vote threshold, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, it is the same comment I made to Senator Murray. It is with profound reluctance because it is not the way we are supposed to conduct business here in the U.S. Senate. [[Page S3789]] I have reached such a level of frustration that I would even consider changing the rules of the Senate that one individual out of 100 can't bring everything to a screeching halt, and that is what is taking place here over an issue. One of the amendments that is being held up is literally putting the lives of our interpreters in Afghanistan at risk. That is the view of General Petraeus, Ambassador Crocker, General Nicholson, and others. If we don't allow these people to come to this country, they are going to die. It is that serious. Senator Gillibrand's and Senator Murray's amendments are important, and I do not in any way diminish them, but we are talking about human lives of people who assisted us in carrying out our mission in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that is what is at stake here. I reluctantly object, and I want to assure Senator Gillibrand that I will do everything in my power--which is not a lot right now when you look at the rules of the Senate--to get a vote. I may have some differences with Senator Gillibrand, but no one has been more dedicated to addressing this issue of a very difficult and frankly embarrassing side of the military today, and that is the incidence of sexual assaults. I reluctantly object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Democratic leader. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been to a few of these rodeos, and I think the only way we are going to get some fairness here is that we do not invoke cloture. As I said, I have been through this a number of times. I think if that happens, people will understand. We have to have a few votes--not a lot of votes but a few votes. I was on the floor yesterday when Senator McCain made this emphatic statement that, frankly, only he could make. He was talking about how people's lives are in jeopardy here, especially with the Shaheen amendment. We don't have to change the rules of the Senate, but I suggest that we do not invoke cloture, give us some time to work out a few amendments, and I think that can happen. We have two experienced legislators. The chairman of the committee and ranking member of the committee, Senator McCain and Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, are two of the best we have here in the Senate, and we should move forward in a way that is expeditious yet productive. Earlier this morning I said that a robust amendment process has not taken place here. There hasn't been an amendment process. You can blame a lot of people, but it hasn't happened. I think this is an important piece of legislation. Senator McCain and I have worked on this issue for years, and we have been at odds on occasion. He was upset that I didn't bring the bill forward quickly enough, but I do remember that we always brought it to the floor. I can remember on one occasion when he and Senator Levin, who has since retired, finished this bill in 2 days, and we had a good bill that came out of here. There were no vetoes, no threats of veto, and we worked out the problems. So I would hope that we can move forward and get some fairness in this bill. It is a huge bill. I have some differences in the bill, but it is not fair that we don't have a better process than what we have had so far. So I would suggest that others vote no on cloture. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. REED. Madam President, I simply want to underscore the importance of these amendments that Senator Murray and Senator Gillibrand are putting forward. There can be disagreement on the substance, but the merits, the importance, and the criticality should be obvious to all of us. I would hope to find a way to have votes on these amendments. The same logic applies to Senator Shaheen and Senator Moran. They have amendments that they have worked tirelessly on for days. They are being frustrated, not by the majority of the Senate but by a few individuals. I think we have reached the point now where we have very little time left. If we could come together at least on a good-faith package of consents to deal with all of these or a majority of these and then continue to work forward for votes on all of them, I think that would be the appropriate thing to do. So, again, I just want to underscore the fact that the issues that Senator Murray and Senator Gillibrand have raised are deserving of a vote, and we should have a vote on these issues. With that, I yield the floor. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. 469, S. 2943, a bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. John McCain, John Cornyn, Orrin G. Hatch, Tom Cotton, Kelly Ayotte, Deb Fischer, Mike Rounds, Lindsey Graham, John Barrasso, Roger F. Wicker, Joni Ernst, Thom Tillis, Daniel Coats, Chuck Grassley, John Thune, Steve Daines, Mitch McConnell. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on S. 2943, an original bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, as amended, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch). Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner), and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 68, nays 23, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 97 Leg.] YEAS--68 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Grassley Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Manchin McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Murkowski Murphy Nelson Perdue Peters Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Schatz Scott Sessions Shelby Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Wicker NAYS--23 Booker Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Cruz Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Hirono Lee Markey Menendez Merkley Murray Paul Reed Reid Schumer Shaheen Warren Whitehouse NOT VOTING--9 Boxer Coons Durbin Hatch Leahy Mikulski Sanders Warner Wyden The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 68, the nays are 23. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. [[Page S3790]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3787-S3790] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 2943, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 2943) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. Pending: [[Page S3788]] McCain amendment No. 4607, to amend the provision on share- in-savings contracts. Reed (for Reid) amendment No. 4603 (to amendment No. 4607), to change the enactment date. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I came to the floor yesterday to talk about a truly shameful change that is buried away in this bill. It is a change that would put us on a path to go back on a promise that we made to our servicemembers just 6 months ago and a change, if left unfixed, that will pull the rug out for men and women in the Armed Forces who are prepared to make the highest sacrifice for the country they love. In case any of my colleagues are unaware, a single line in this massive Defense bill on page 1,455, buried in the funding chart, would zero out a new program that is intended to help men and women in our military realize their dream of having a family even if they go on to suffer catastrophic injuries when they are fighting on our behalf. I don't know how this line got in there, I don't know who thought it was a good idea, and I don't know why, but what I do know is this: It is wrong and it has to be fixed. I just want to tell my colleagues that 6 months ago the Pentagon announced a pilot program that would offer servicemembers who are getting ready to deploy an opportunity at cryopreservation--in other words, freezing their eggs or sperm. This new program gave our deploying servicemembers not just the ability to have reproductive options in the event they are grievously injured but some deserved peace of mind. It took us a step forward in the promise we have made to our servicemembers to support them when they sacrifice so much for us, and it meant they wouldn't have to worry about choosing between defending their country or a chance of having a family some day. This new program was met with widespread praise and relief. Men and women who were getting ready to deploy--many of whom were thinking about exploring cryopreservation, using their own money if they could afford it--were assured that their country had their back. While the pilot program was not groundbreaking, these services have long been available in the private sector, and, in fact, fertility preservation techniques have been used by the British Armed Forces for years. It reflected a basic level of respect for servicemembers who are willing to risk suffering catastrophic injuries on our behalf, and it sent a clear message that no matter what happens to them on the battlefield, we will be ready to stand with them with whatever they need. I was hoping this new program was a step we could build on, a move in the right direction, an important part of our larger work to help our warriors who sustained grievous injuries achieve their dream of starting a family, which is why I was so upset when I learned this bill would move us the other way. It would take this promise we just made to our warriors and toss it in the trash. It would be a slap in the face to the men and women who serve us proudly and heroically. And honestly, it is the wrong thing to do. Many people here in the Senate are quick to honor our military with their words, but for the men and women who signed up to fight on our behalf and are looking ahead to potentially massive sacrifices, we owe them so much more than that. We owe them action, respect, and a shot at their dream of having a family. We need to fix this bill. We owe them that much. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to offer Murray amendment No. 4490 relating to fertility treatments and that the Senate vote in relation to this amendment with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reluctantly have to object, and that is because there is an objection on this side, which I have to honor. I thank Senator Murray for her advocacy for the people who are serving in our military in uniform, and this is at least an important aspect of military life, and I thank the Senator for that. I also thank Senator Gillibrand, who will speak in a moment on an issue that has been of great importance to her for several years now. She has been an advocate of this very compelling issue of sexual assault in the military. Unfortunately, we have an objection to all the amendments, and that, in my view, is a great disservice to this body, to the men and women serving in the military, and to the American public. It shouldn't matter whether I happen to agree or disagree with Senator Gillibrand or Senator Murray; they deserve debate and votes, and they are not getting them because of these objections. I wish to also point out that we are working on amendments by Senator Moran, Senator Corker, Senator Gillibrand, and Senator Shaheen. I might point out gratuitously that one of the things I have seen in recent years is involvement on issues that bring new perspectives from people like Senator Gillibrand, Senator Murray, Senator Ayotte, Senator McCaskill, Senator Fischer, and Senator Ernst. They have brought perspectives to our committee and to this body that have been very helpful. All I can say is this: Senator Murray, I will continue to fight to get a vote on your amendment. Mr. President, I reluctantly object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from New York. Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his remarks, and I thank the leaders. I urge my colleagues to allow a vote on my amendment No. 4310. We now know far more about the extent of the military sexual assault problem than we did last year. We have more data, we have reviewed more case files, we heard from more survivors, and it is clear that very little has changed despite the Department of Defense's persistent claims that things are getting better and that they are making progress. When the Department of Defense estimates that 20,000 servicemembers were sexually assaulted this year--the same number as in 2010--that is not progress. When an estimate of 8 out of 10 military sexual assault survivors don't report the crime, that is not progress. When more than half of all retaliation cases--58 percent of them--are perpetrated by someone in the chain of command of the accuser, that is not progress. When the percentage of survivors willing to report openly has declined for the past 5 years, that is not progress. When 62 percent of survivors have experienced retaliation since 2012 and there has not been one prosecution of this enumerated crime, that is not progress. When it is confirmed by the Associated Press that the Pentagon blatantly misled the Senate in order to skew our debate, this is perhaps the ultimate time that they are not making progress. Our military justice system is broken. It is failing our men and women who so bravely serve. No matter how many small reforms we make, as long as commanders with no legal experience are continuing to make these important decisions about violent sexual crimes, we are not going to solve this problem. Our commanders are great at winning wars and training troops. They are not prosecutors. They are not even lawyers. They are warfighters, and their job is to keep our country safe, not make legal judgments about whether to prosecute a rape. Once and for all, let's take this decision to prosecute these crimes and instead give it to trained military prosecutors. Let's give our servicemembers a justice system that is worthy of their service. This is our chance, and I urge everyone to vote yes if we have a vote. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked for S. 2943, notwithstanding rule XXII, that Gillibrand amendment No. 4310, the Military Justice Improvement Act, be considered in order postcloture, and that it be in order to offer amendment No. 4310, and the Senate vote in relation to that amendment with a 60 affirmative vote threshold, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, it is the same comment I made to Senator Murray. It is with profound reluctance because it is not the way we are supposed to conduct business here in the U.S. Senate. [[Page S3789]] I have reached such a level of frustration that I would even consider changing the rules of the Senate that one individual out of 100 can't bring everything to a screeching halt, and that is what is taking place here over an issue. One of the amendments that is being held up is literally putting the lives of our interpreters in Afghanistan at risk. That is the view of General Petraeus, Ambassador Crocker, General Nicholson, and others. If we don't allow these people to come to this country, they are going to die. It is that serious. Senator Gillibrand's and Senator Murray's amendments are important, and I do not in any way diminish them, but we are talking about human lives of people who assisted us in carrying out our mission in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that is what is at stake here. I reluctantly object, and I want to assure Senator Gillibrand that I will do everything in my power--which is not a lot right now when you look at the rules of the Senate--to get a vote. I may have some differences with Senator Gillibrand, but no one has been more dedicated to addressing this issue of a very difficult and frankly embarrassing side of the military today, and that is the incidence of sexual assaults. I reluctantly object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Democratic leader. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been to a few of these rodeos, and I think the only way we are going to get some fairness here is that we do not invoke cloture. As I said, I have been through this a number of times. I think if that happens, people will understand. We have to have a few votes--not a lot of votes but a few votes. I was on the floor yesterday when Senator McCain made this emphatic statement that, frankly, only he could make. He was talking about how people's lives are in jeopardy here, especially with the Shaheen amendment. We don't have to change the rules of the Senate, but I suggest that we do not invoke cloture, give us some time to work out a few amendments, and I think that can happen. We have two experienced legislators. The chairman of the committee and ranking member of the committee, Senator McCain and Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, are two of the best we have here in the Senate, and we should move forward in a way that is expeditious yet productive. Earlier this morning I said that a robust amendment process has not taken place here. There hasn't been an amendment process. You can blame a lot of people, but it hasn't happened. I think this is an important piece of legislation. Senator McCain and I have worked on this issue for years, and we have been at odds on occasion. He was upset that I didn't bring the bill forward quickly enough, but I do remember that we always brought it to the floor. I can remember on one occasion when he and Senator Levin, who has since retired, finished this bill in 2 days, and we had a good bill that came out of here.

If we could come together at least on a good-faith package of consents to deal with all of these or a majority of these and then continue to work forward for votes on all of them, I think that would be the appropriate thing to do. So, again, I just want to underscore the fact that the issues that Senator Murray and Senator Gillibrand have raised are deserving of a vote, and we should have a vote on these issues. With that, I yield the floor. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. 469, S. 2943, a bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. John McCain, John Cornyn, Orrin G. Hatch, Tom Cotton, Kelly Ayotte, Deb Fischer, Mike Rounds, Lindsey Graham, John Barrasso, Roger F. Wicker, Joni Ernst, Thom Tillis, Daniel Coats, Chuck Grassley, John Thune, Steve Daines, Mitch McConnell. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on S. 2943, an original bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, as amended, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch). Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner), and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 68, nays 23, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 97 Leg.] YEAS--68 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Grassley Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Manchin McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Murkowski Murphy Nelson Perdue Peters Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Schatz Scott Sessions Shelby Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Wicker NAYS--23 Booker Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Cruz Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Hirono Lee Markey Menendez Merkley Murray Paul Reed Reid Schumer Shaheen Warren Whitehouse NOT VOTING--9 Boxer Coons Durbin Hatch Leahy Mikulski Sanders Warner Wyden The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 68, the nays are 23. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. [[Page S3790]] The PRESIDING OFFICER.

mr. mccain. mr. president, i reluctantly have to object, and that is because there is an objection on this side, which i have to honor. i thank senator murray for her advocacy for the people who are serving in our military in uniform, and this is at least an important aspect of military life, and i thank the senator for that. i also thank senator gillibrand, who will speak in a moment on an issue that has been of great importance to her for several years now. she has been an advocate of this very compelling issue of sexual assault in the military. unfortunately, we have an objection to all the amendments, and that, in my view, is a great disservice to this body, to the men and women serving in the military, and to the american public. it shouldn't matter whether i happen to agree or disagree with senator gillibrand or senator murray; they deserve debate and votes, and they are not getting them because of these objections. i wish to also point out that we are working on amendments by senator moran, senator corker, senator gillibrand, and senator shaheen. i might point out gratuitously that one of the things i have seen in recent years is involvement on issues that bring new perspectives from people like senator gillibrand, senator murray, senator ayotte, senator mccaskill, senator fischer, and senator ernst. they have brought perspectives to our committee and to this body that have been very helpful. all i can say is this: senator murray, i will continue to fight to get a vote on your amendment. mr. president, i reluctantly object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. the senator from new york. mrs. gillibrand. mr. president, i thank the chairman for his remarks, and i thank the leaders. i urge my colleagues to allow a vote on my amendment no. 4310. we now know far more about the extent of the military sexual assault problem than we did last year. we have more data, we have reviewed more case files, we heard from more survivors, and it is clear that very little has changed despite the department of defense's persistent claims that things are getting better and that they are making progress. when the department of defense estimates that 20,000 servicemembers were sexually assaulted this year--the same number as in 2010--that is not progress. when an estimate of 8 out of 10 military sexual assault survivors don't report the crime, that is not progress. when more than half of all retaliation cases--58 percent of them--are perpetrated by someone in the chain of command of the accuser, that is not progress. when the percentage of survivors willing to report openly has declined for the past 5 years, that is not progress. when 62 percent of survivors have experienced retaliation since 2012 and there has not been one prosecution of this enumerated crime, that is not progress. when it is confirmed by the associated press that the pentagon blatantly misled the senate in order to skew our debate, this is perhaps the ultimate time that they are not making progress. our military justice system is broken. it is failing our men and women who so bravely serve. no matter how many small reforms we make, as long as commanders with no legal experience are continuing to make these important decisions about violent sexual crimes, we are not going to solve this problem. our commanders are great at winning wars and training troops. they are not prosecutors. they are not even lawyers. they are warfighters, and their job is to keep our country safe, not make legal judgments about whether to prosecute a rape. once and for all, let's take this decision to prosecute these crimes and instead give it to trained military prosecutors. let's give our servicemembers a justice system that is worthy of their service. this is our chance, and i urge everyone to vote yes if we have a vote. mr. president, i now ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked for s. 2943, notwithstanding rule xxii, that gillibrand amendment no. 4310, the military justice improvement act, be considered in order postcloture, and that it be in order to offer amendment no. 4310, and the senate vote in relation to that amendment with a 60 affirmative vote threshold, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote. the presiding officer. is there objection? mr. mccain. mr. president, again, it is the same comment i made to senator murray. it is with profound reluctance because it is not the way we are supposed to conduct business here in the u.s. senate. [[page s3789]] i have reached such a level of frustration that i would even consider changing the rules of the senate that one individual out of 100 can't bring everything to a screeching halt, and that is what is taking place here over an issue. one of the amendments that is being held up is literally putting the lives of our interpreters in afghanistan at risk. that is the view of general petraeus, ambassador crocker, general nicholson, and others. if we don't allow these people to come to this country, they are going to die. it is that serious. senator gillibrand's and senator murray's amendments are important, and i do not in any way diminish them, but we are talking about human lives of people who assisted us in carrying out our mission in iraq and afghanistan, and that is what is at stake here. i reluctantly object, and i want to assure senator gillibrand that i will do everything in my power--which is not a lot right now when you look at the rules of the senate--to get a vote. i may have some differences with senator gillibrand, but no one has been more dedicated to addressing this issue of a very difficult and frankly embarrassing side of the military today, and that is the incidence of sexual assaults. i reluctantly object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. the democratic leader. mr. reid. mr. president, i have been to a few of these rodeos, and i think the only way we are going to get some fairness here is that we do not invoke cloture. as i said, i have been through this a number of times. i think if that happens, people will understand. we have to have a few votes--not a lot of votes but a few votes. i was on the floor yesterday when senator mccain made this emphatic statement that, frankly, only he could make. he was talking about how people's lives are in jeopardy here, especially with the shaheen amendment. we don't have to change the rules of the senate, but i suggest that we do not invoke cloture, give us some time to work out a few amendments, and i think that can happen. we have two experienced legislators. the chairman of the committee and ranking member of the committee, senator mccain and senator jack reed of rhode island, are two of the best we have here in the senate, and we should move forward in a way that is expeditious yet productive. earlier this morning i said that a robust amendment process has not taken place here. there hasn't been an amendment process. you can blame a lot of people, but it hasn't happened. i think this is an important piece of legislation. senator mccain and i have worked on this issue for years, and we have been at odds on occasion. he was upset that i didn't bring the bill forward quickly enough, but i do remember that we always brought it to the floor. i can remember on one occasion when he and senator levin, who has since retired, finished this bill in 2 days, and we had a good bill that came out of here. there were no vetoes, no threats of veto, and we worked out the problems. so i would hope that we can move forward and get some fairness in this bill. it is a huge bill. i have some differences in the bill, but it is not fair that we don't have a better process than what we have had so far. so i would suggest that others vote no on cloture. the presiding officer (mrs. capito). the senator from rhode island. mr. reed. madam president, i simply want to underscore the importance of these amendments that senator murray and senator gillibrand are putting forward. there can be disagreement on the substance, but the merits, the importance, and the criticality should be obvious to all of us. i would hope to find a way to have votes on these amendments. the same logic applies to senator shaheen and senator moran. they have amendments that they have worked tirelessly on for days. they are being frustrated, not by the majority of the senate but by a few individuals. i think we have reached the point now where we have very little time left. if we could come together at least on a good-faith package of consents to deal with all of these or a majority of these and then continue to work forward for votes on all of them, i think that would be

MEREDITH MARCH AGAINST FEAR""","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3790] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ``JAMES H. MEREDITH MARCH AGAINST FEAR'' Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 488, submitted earlier today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 488) recognizing the historical significance and the 50th anniversary of the ``James H. Meredith March Against Fear,'' a 220-mile walk down Highway 51 from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The resolution (S. Res. 488) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to. (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'') Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I think this is a very appropriate time to recognize the Meredith March Against Fear. On June 5, 1966, 4 years after becoming the first African-American student to enroll at the University of Mississippi, James Meredith began his historic Meredith March Against Fear. The march began at the Peabody Hotel in downtown Memphis and would conclude some 3 weeks later at the Mississippi State Capitol in Jackson. On June 6, Mr. Meredith and his small band of supporters encountered gunshots about 1 mile south of Hernando, MS. James Meredith was shot three times on that day and was taken to a hospital. Although he would recover, Meredith was unable to complete his March Against Fear, and the leadership was taken over by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Floyd McKissick, and Stokely Carmichael. By the time the march reached the city limits of Canton, the number of marchers had doubled to 250. By the time it concluded in Jackson, there were 15,000 people in attendance. This overwhelming turnout made it the largest civil rights demonstration in the history of the State of Mississippi. More than 4,000 African Americans were registered to vote from rallies and drives during the march along U.S. Highway 51. Mr. Meredith still lives in Jackson, where he is frequently seen wearing his Ole Miss cap and attending Ole Miss athletic events in Oxford. He will turn 83 1 day before the 50th anniversary of the march's conclusion. Today, the Senate recognizes the courageous leadership of James Meredith. I think it is appropriate that this resolution is sponsored by the three current Members of the Senate who are graduates of the University of Mississippi--Senator Cochran, Senator Shaheen, and this Senator. I commend the Senate on its recognition of this important individual and this significant milestone in the history of the civil rights movement. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3790] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ``JAMES H.

(the resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's record under ``submitted resolutions.'') mr. wicker. madam president, i think this is a very appropriate time to recognize the meredith march against fear. on june 5, 1966, 4 years after becoming the first african-american student to enroll at the university of mississippi, james meredith began his historic meredith march against fear. the march began at the peabody hotel in downtown memphis and would conclude some 3 weeks later at the mississippi state capitol in jackson. on june 6, mr. meredith and his small band of supporters encountered gunshots about 1 mile south of hernando, ms. james meredith was shot three times on that day and was taken to a hospital. although he would recover, meredith was unable to complete his march against fear, and the leadership was taken over by dr. martin luther king, jr., floyd mckissick, and stokely carmichael. by the time the march reached the city limits of canton, the number of marchers had doubled to 250. by the time it concluded in jackson, there were 15,000 people in attendance. this overwhelming turnout made it the largest civil rights demonstration in the history of the state of mississippi. more than 4,000 african americans were registered to vote from rallies and drives during the march along u.s. highway 51. mr. meredith still lives in jackson, where he is frequently seen wearing his ole miss cap and attending ole miss athletic events in oxford. he will turn 83 1 day before the 50th anniversary of the march's conclusion. today, the senate recognizes the courageous leadership of james meredith. i think it is appropriate that this resolution is sponsored by the three current members of the senate who are graduates of the university of mississippi--senator cochran, senator shaheen, and this senator. i commend the senate on its recognition of this important individual and this significant milestone in the history of the civil rights movement. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mccain. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",3497

Madam President, today I recognize Thomas Galyon of Rogers, AR, as this week's Arkansan of the Week for his advocacy work with the Arkansas chapter of the national ALS Association. Tom was diagnosed with ALS in 2014 and has been a tireless advocate ever since. Tom isn't one to let ALS hold him back. In fact, after spending 33 successful years in the tourism industry, Tom decided retirement wasn't for him and went back to work as the property manager for the Center for Nonprofits at St. Mary's in northwest Arkansas. As luck would have it, the ALS Association is headquartered in the very building Tom manages, making his commitment to their organization that much stronger. Recently I had the opportunity to meet with Tom when he came to Washington to advocate on behalf of the ALS Association. We had a long discussion, where I learned about Tom's story and the struggle of nearly 20,000 other Americans who are currently living with ALS. During our meeting, Tom asked me to address the problem that persons with ALS face when seeking disability insurance. I was proud to work with my colleague Senator Whitehouse to become the lead Republican sponsor of the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, a bill that would waive the 5-month waiting period to receive disability insurance program benefits for those living with ALS. While the waiting period may be prudent in many cases, for ALS it consumes a lot of the remaining life expectancy once you get a diagnosis of ALS. We now have nine sponsors. As we gain more support, I am hopeful this bill will move forward and eventually become law. In a testimony about his journey with ALS, Tom writes: ``Until there is a treatment or a cure for ALS I will continue to be an avid advocate for change in government policies and procedures that affect all ALS patients in a negative way.'' I encourage all Arkansans to take a lesson from Tom's words: Advocacy works. If there is a bill or regulatory matter that impacts your life, I want to hear about it. To become an advocate, contact my office and tell me your story. It is part of my job to represent you in the Senate. Tom's journey is a remarkable one. He has not let the unexpected discourage him. In fact, he has used his diagnosis to teach others about ALS and [[Page S3791]] bring us closer to a cure. As Tom himself always says, ``Blue skies always.'' I think that is a mantra everyone in the Senate and Arkansas could adopt, too. It is my honor to recognize Thomas Galyon as this week's Arkansan of the Week. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. COLLINS.

CREC-2016-06-10-pt1-PgS3791,CREC-2016-06-10,114,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3791-S3792] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, a bill upon which we have fortunately invoked cloture today and which I hope will allow us to proceed to finish this vitally important legislation. I wish to commend both Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed for their leadership as they worked together. Their bill puts us on a path toward addressing the myriad threats we face today. In fact, in my years in the Senate, it is difficult to think of a time in which we have faced more threats from more different adversaries around the world. These national security challenges include the challenges posed by ISIS, as it continues to control territory and key cities in Syria and Iraq and spreads to other countries, such as Libya and Nigeria; Al Qaeda and other Islamic extremist terrorist groups determined to attack our country and our allies; Russia's aggressive operations in Ukraine, the Baltics, and Syria; and China's aggressive military activities in the South China Sea. This bill funds programs that ensure our Nation's continued presence and deterrence missions, including $271 million to help complete the construction of two DDG-1000 Destroyers. These ships provide capabilities including stealth technology, electric propulsion, and a smaller crew size. The Navy recently accepted delivery of the first DDG-1000, the Zumwalt--a major milestone for this revolutionary program. Given the ship's cutting-edge technology, unique hull, and advanced combat systems, the shipbuilders at Bath Iron Works in my State should be commended for their exceptional work and dedication in building the largest naval destroyer and the most advanced naval destroyer in history. The bill before us also includes $3.2 billion for the procurement of two Arleigh Burke-Class Destroyers as part of a multiyear procurement contract, as well as incremental funding for a third fiscal year 2016 Flight Three Destroyer. This much needed additional destroyer, which ranks No. 2 on the Navy's unfunded priorities list, will be built at Bath Iron Works. As the workhorses of the Navy, these destroyers help ensure that our Navy's capabilities remain unrivaled in delivering power and presence across the globe. From freedom of navigation missions in the South China Sea to addressing Iranian aggression in the Strait of Hormuz, these ships signal to enemies and allies alike that the U.S. Navy is ready to respond wherever and whenever it is needed. After years of advocacy, I am pleased this legislation also includes an important provision that requires the Department of Defense to finally comply with the Berry amendment by outfitting new recruits with high-quality athletic shoes made in America by skilled American workers. This amendment, sponsored by my colleague Senator King, is based upon stand-alone legislation that I introduced with my colleague from Maine. It is good not only for our troops but also for American manufacturing. It is time to stop relying on goods manufactured in foreign countries to outfit those who wear the uniform of our Nation. It is past time for the Department's circumvention of the Berry amendment to be ended when it comes to athletic footwear. This bill also provides for investments in our public shipyards, which are strategic assets for our national security. For Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME, almost $75 million is authorized for necessary upgrades, including $18 million for unaccompanied housing, $30 million for utility improvements for nuclear platforms, and $27 million to construct a replacement for a medical and dental unit that is in a building that is 100 years old and does not meet current safety standards. As the senior member of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, I am pleased these authorizations match the funding included in our Military Construction and VA spending bill that passed the Senate overwhelmingly a few weeks ago. These investments at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard will result in the high-quality facilities that shipyard personnel deserve as they maintain, repair, and modernize our nuclear submarine fleet. The bill also provides the resources necessary to help our allies and partners around the world. I am pleased it would authorize $50 million for the U.S.-Israel Anti-Tunneling Cooperation Program. The terrorist organization Hamas continues to construct tunnels from Gaza to Israel, which have been used by terrorists to sneak across the border and carry out attacks on Israeli citizens. Meanwhile, we have the problem of Iran, which has continued to defy a U.N. Security Council resolution on its ballistic missile program by conducting flight testing of missiles that are inherently capable of delivering nuclear weapons that could someday reach the United States. They already are capable of reaching Israel, which is why this bill's continued support for the U.S.-Israeli cooperative missile defense programs is so important. I am pleased to note that the National Defense Authorization Act contains several measures supporting our servicemembers, who perform the important missions we assign them. These provisions include a 1.6- percent pay raise and reauthorization of bonuses and special pay to help encourage retention. I know this has been a real problem, for example, for the Air Force in retaining the pilots it needs, who oftentimes can make so much more money and have far easier missions and hours in the private sector. I filed an amendment, as I did last year, to strike a provision in this bill that would unfairly discriminate against women servicemembers. The provision mandates that if two or more servicemembers live in the same house, the amount of the basic allowance for housing payable to each member would be divided by the total number of members in the house. That means, in cases where a servicemember resides with his or her Active-Duty spouse or if a member resides with military roommates, each would proportionately lose his or her stipend for housing under this bill. This disproportionately affects female servicemembers because 20 percent of them are married to another servicemember. In contrast, less than 4 percent of Active-Duty men are married to Active-Duty women servicemembers. I hope we can change this provision. Other provisions of this bill would provide additional protections for survivors of sexual assault to move closer to the goal of translating the military's stated policy of zero tolerance into reality. Specifically, the bill would create a new punitive article in the Uniform Code of Military Justice that criminalizes acts of retaliation. The article would hold servicemembers accountable if they threaten or take adverse personnel action against those who report or plan to report retaliation. Finally, this bill would direct the Pentagon to rein in unnecessary and wasteful spending by reducing the number of general and flag officers by 25 percent. This is an issue that I have been working on with Chairman McCain since 2012, and I am pleased to see the continued focus on ending the practice of rank inflation. I should mention that I have the greatest respect for the high- ranking officials as well as for all who serve in our military. But this is an issue that we do need to deal with, and I believe this bill strikes the appropriate balance. We owe it to taxpayers to assess every efficiency and use every cost-saving measure while also ensuring the security of our Nation. I thank the Presiding Officer for her patience. I know the Senate is soon to [[Page S3792]] adjourn. I urge support of this important bill. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue).

In fact, in my years in the Senate, it is difficult to think of a time in which we have faced more threats from more different adversaries around the world. These national security challenges include the challenges posed by ISIS, as it continues to control territory and key cities in Syria and Iraq and spreads to other countries, such as Libya and Nigeria; Al Qaeda and other Islamic extremist terrorist groups determined to attack our country and our allies; Russia's aggressive operations in Ukraine, the Baltics, and Syria; and China's aggressive military activities in the South China Sea. This bill funds programs that ensure our Nation's continued presence and deterrence missions, including $271 million to help complete the construction of two DDG-1000 Destroyers. These ships provide capabilities including stealth technology, electric propulsion, and a smaller crew size. The Navy recently accepted delivery of the first DDG-1000, the Zumwalt--a major milestone for this revolutionary program. Given the ship's cutting-edge technology, unique hull, and advanced combat systems, the shipbuilders at Bath Iron Works in my State should be commended for their exceptional work and dedication in building the largest naval destroyer and the most advanced naval destroyer in history. The bill before us also includes $3.2 billion for the procurement of two Arleigh Burke-Class Destroyers as part of a multiyear procurement contract, as well as incremental funding for a third fiscal year 2016 Flight Three Destroyer. This much needed additional destroyer, which ranks No. 2 on the Navy's unfunded priorities list, will be built at Bath Iron Works. As the workhorses of the Navy, these destroyers help ensure that our Navy's capabilities remain unrivaled in delivering power and presence across the globe. From freedom of navigation missions in the South China Sea to addressing Iranian aggression in the Strait of Hormuz, these ships signal to enemies and allies alike that the U.S. Navy is ready to respond wherever and whenever it is needed. After years of advocacy, I am pleased this legislation also includes an important provision that requires the Department of Defense to finally comply with the Berry amendment by outfitting new recruits with high-quality athletic shoes made in America by skilled American workers. This amendment, sponsored by my colleague Senator King, is based upon stand-alone legislation that I introduced with my colleague from Maine. It is good not only for our troops but also for American manufacturing. It is time to stop relying on goods manufactured in foreign countries to outfit those who wear the uniform of our Nation. It is past time for the Department's circumvention of the Berry amendment to be ended when it comes to athletic footwear. This bill also provides for investments in our public shipyards, which are strategic assets for our national security. For Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME, almost $75 million is authorized for necessary upgrades, including $18 million for unaccompanied housing, $30 million for utility improvements for nuclear platforms, and $27 million to construct a replacement for a medical and dental unit that is in a building that is 100 years old and does not meet current safety standards. As the senior member of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, I am pleased these authorizations match the funding included in our Military Construction and VA spending bill that passed the Senate overwhelmingly a few weeks ago. These investments at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard will result in the high-quality facilities that shipyard personnel deserve as they maintain, repair, and modernize our nuclear submarine fleet. The bill also provides the resources necessary to help our allies and partners around the world. I am pleased it would authorize $50 million for the U.S.-Israel Anti-Tunneling Cooperation Program. The terrorist organization Hamas continues to construct tunnels from Gaza to Israel, which have been used by terrorists to sneak across the border and carry out attacks on Israeli citizens. Meanwhile, we have the problem of Iran, which has continued to defy a U.N. Security Council resolution on its ballistic missile program by conducting flight testing of missiles that are inherently capable of delivering nuclear weapons that could someday reach the United States. They already are capable of reaching Israel, which is why this bill's continued support for the U.S.-Israeli cooperative missile defense programs is so important. I am pleased to note that the National Defense Authorization Act contains several measures supporting our servicemembers, who perform the important missions we assign them. These provisions include a 1.6- percent pay raise and reauthorization of bonuses and special pay to help encourage retention. I know this has been a real problem, for example, for the Air Force in retaining the pilots it needs, who oftentimes can make so much more money and have far easier missions and hours in the private sector. I filed an amendment, as I did last year, to strike a provision in this bill that would unfairly discriminate against women servicemembers. The provision mandates that if two or more servicemembers live in the same house, the amount of the basic allowance for housing payable to each member would be divided by the total number of members in the house. That means, in cases where a servicemember resides with his or her Active-Duty spouse or if a member resides with military roommates, each would proportionately lose his or her stipend for housing under this bill. This disproportionately affects female servicemembers because 20 percent of them are married to another servicemember. In contrast, less than 4 percent of Active-Duty men are married to Active-Duty women servicemembers. I hope we can change this provision. Other provisions of this bill would provide additional protections for survivors of sexual assault to move closer to the goal of translating the military's stated policy of zero tolerance into reality. Specifically, the bill would create a new punitive article in the Uniform Code of Military Justice that criminalizes acts of retaliation. The article would hold servicemembers accountable if they threaten or take adverse personnel action against those who report or plan to report retaliation. Finally, this bill would direct the Pentagon to rein in unnecessary and wasteful spending by reducing the number of general and flag officers by 25 percent. This is an issue that I have been working on with Chairman McCain since 2012, and I am pleased to see the continued focus on ending the practice of rank inflation. I should mention that I have the greatest respect for the high- ranking officials as well as for all who serve in our military. But this is an issue that we do need to deal with, and I believe this bill strikes the appropriate balance. We owe it to taxpayers to assess every efficiency and use every cost-saving measure while also ensuring the security of our Nation. I thank the Presiding Officer for her patience. I know the Senate is soon to [[Page S3792]] adjourn. I urge support of this important bill. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue).

CREC-2016-06-10-pt1-PgS3792,CREC-2016-06-10,114,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION AND FEMALE VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION BILLS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3792] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION AND FEMALE VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION BILLS Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it was encouraging to see the Senate vote to advance the National Defense Authorization Act this morning. It reflects a recognition by this body of the importance of the bill and the moment. The defense authorization act will promote defense innovation and research, it will modernize retirement benefits for our men and women in uniform, and authorize the pay raises they deserve. It will help prepare our country for the threats of today and the challenges of tomorrow, and it will better enable the next Commander in Chief, regardless of party, to deal with them as well. That is critical given that the next President is about to inherit an array of threats and troubling instability in the Middle East. Yesterday Senators laid out many ways in which President Obama's foreign policy has fallen short. One was lack of strategic vision. Take for instance his unnecessary threat to veto this very bill. He doesn't like bipartisan prohibitions on transferring hardcore terrorists from Guantanamo's secure facilities to American communities or unstable countries. We include similar bipartisan provisions year after year after year. He makes similar threats year after year after year, but he signs the bill year after year, so it is time to quit that. This bill just advanced in the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 68 to 23. The funding levels this bill authorizes is exactly the same as what President Obama requested in his budget, and unless the President is actually more concerned about a campaign slogan from back in 2008 than he is about grave threats we face in 2016, he will sign it. I thank colleagues on both sides for their hard work on this legislation, particularly Chairman McCain. He is always on guard for our men and women in uniform, and he is always standing up for our national security. This bill is a reflection of his commitment. It is an important step for the American people, but it is not the only one we took this past week. It has been reported that we lose over 20 veterans each day to suicide, and one study has revealed that suicide rates among female veterans grew by 40 percent between 2000 and 2010. This is heartbreaking, and it underlines the importance of the Female Veterans Suicide Prevention Act that the Senate passed earlier this week. This legislation will require the VA to take a closer look at this issue and assess which mental health care and veteran suicide prevention programs are most successful for our female veterans. It builds upon the progress of the Clay Hunt Act, an important law we passed last year that provides more of the suicide prevention and mental health support our veterans deserve. As Senator Ernst recently reminded us, our servicemembers have selflessly sacrificed in defense of our freedoms, and we should help ensure that they are prepared to transition back to civilian life, which includes access to quality and timely mental health care they deserve. Senator Ernst knows what it means to serve. I thank her for her continued leadership for Iowa and for her work on this bill with Senators Boxer, Blumenthal, and Brown. This veterans mental health legislation is another example of what we can accomplish when we work together to find solutions for the American people, and it is another example of a Senate that is back to work. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3792] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION AND FEMALE VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION BILLS Mr. McCONNELL.

This veterans mental health legislation is another example of what we can accomplish when we work together to find solutions for the American people, and it is another example of a Senate that is back to work. ____________________",package_114_182.csv,3618,3618,3684,"[congressional record volume 162, number 92 (friday, june 10, 2016)] [senate] [page s3792] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] national defense authorization and female veteran suicide prevention bills mr. mcconnell. mr. president, it was encouraging to see the senate vote to advance the national defense authorization act this morning. it reflects a recognition by this body of the importance of the bill and the moment. the defense authorization act will promote defense innovation and research, it will modernize retirement benefits for our men and women in uniform, and authorize the pay raises they deserve. it will help prepare our country for the threats of today and the challenges of tomorrow, and it will better enable the next commander in chief, regardless of party, to deal with them as well. that is critical given that the next president is about to inherit an array of threats and troubling instability in the middle east. yesterday senators laid out many ways in which president obama's foreign policy has fallen short. one was lack of strategic vision. take for instance his unnecessary threat to veto this very bill. he doesn't like bipartisan prohibitions on transferring hardcore terrorists from guantanamo's secure facilities to american communities or unstable countries. we include similar bipartisan provisions year after year after year. he makes similar threats year after year after year, but he signs the bill year after year, so it is time to quit that. this bill just advanced in the senate by a bipartisan vote of 68 to 23. the funding levels this bill authorizes is exactly the same as what president obama requested in his budget, and unless the president is actually more concerned about a campaign slogan from back in 2008 than he is about grave threats we face in 2016, he will sign it. i thank colleagues on both sides for their hard work on this legislation, particularly chairman mccain. he is always on guard for our men and women in uniform, and he is always standing up for our national security. this bill is a reflection of his commitment. it is an important step for the american people, but it is not the only one we took this past week. it has been reported that we lose over 20 veterans each day to suicide, and one study has revealed that suicide rates among female veterans grew by 40 percent between 2000 and 2010. this is heartbreaking, and it underlines the importance of the female veterans suicide prevention act that the senate passed earlier this week. this legislation will require the va to take a closer look at this issue and assess which mental health care and veteran suicide prevention programs are most successful for our female veterans. it builds upon the progress of the clay hunt act, an important law we passed last year that provides more of the suicide prevention and mental health support our veterans deserve. as senator ernst recently reminded us, our servicemembers have selflessly sacrificed in defense of our freedoms, and we should help ensure that they are prepared to transition back to civilian life, which includes access to quality and timely mental health care they deserve. senator ernst knows what it means to serve. i thank her for her continued leadership for iowa and for her work on this bill with senators boxer, blumenthal, and brown. this veterans mental health legislation is another example of what we can accomplish when we work together to find solutions for the american people, and it is another example of a senate that is back to work. ____________________",3618
CREC-2016-06-10-pt1-PgS3792-2,CREC-2016-06-10,114,SOCIAL IMPACT PARTNERSHIP BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3792] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SOCIAL IMPACT PARTNERSHIP BILL Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 1089, a bill to encourage and support partnerships between the public and private sectors to improve our Nation's social programs, and for other purposes, known as the Social Impact Partnership Act, SIPA. This legislation would facilitate the creation of public-private partnerships that have the goal of improving the outcomes from our Nation's social services spending in order to benefit both the people intended to be helped by those programs and the U.S. taxpayer. It would do so by creating the Federal Interagency Council on Social Impact Partnerships, which would recommend to the Treasury Secretary that the Federal Government enter into agreements with State and local governments and private investors to pay for successful social improvement programs funded by private investors out of savings those programs create for the Federal Government. The bill appropriates $300 million for this purpose and aims to ensure that the savings to the Federal Government from the projects selected will exceed that $300 million. If a social services program is not successful, the Federal Government will not pay for it. In this way, SIPA helps to reorient Federal social spending towards measurable improvements in the lives of those served. While I am supportive of the bill, I do want to note for the record that this bill could benefit from further assurances at a committee markup that the funded projects will result in governmental savings. The appropriations for the legislation should be offset with spending reductions in other areas, as has been done in the companion legislation in the House of Representatives. There should be a specified role in the legislation for CBO and OMB to certify for taxpayers that the Federal performance payments authorized in the bill for successful projects do not exceed actual programmatic savings and that this bill provides better social outcomes for equal or less total money spent. Finally, the bill should ensure that there is no way for any program stakeholder, government official, or member of the Federal Interagency Council on Social Impact Partnerships to unduly influence the measured outcome of these funded projects, which is required to receive federal payments. As part of these protections, there should be strict conflict of interest rules in place to prohibit those involved in selecting and measuring the projects from having a financial interest in their outcome. The purpose of the Social Impact Partnership Act is to establish funding for innovative social service projects that work and ending funding for those that do not. If there is any evidence that such innovation is not occurring and SIPA is becoming yet another wasteful and politically influenced government program, I will work to end it. I thank Senators Hatch and Bennet for their great work on this bill, and I look forward to its markup in the Finance Committee and passage in the full Senate. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3792] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SOCIAL IMPACT PARTNERSHIP BILL Mr. CORKER.

A bill to withdraw certain Federal land located in Malheur County, Oregon, from all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws, location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and operation under the mineral leasing laws, to provide for the conduct of certain economic activities in Malheur County, Oregon, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Southeastern Oregon Mineral Withdrawal and Economic Preservation and Development Act to provide a boost to the rural Oregon economy and to protect the world-renowned Southeastern Oregon landscape. I am pleased to introduce this bill with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Jeff Merkley. In Southeastern Oregon, the high desert landscape is home to hundreds of millions of acres of public lands that have hosted cattle ranching and visitors and locals for generations. These lands are supported by Oregonians who grew up there and who rely on them as a long-time linchpin for their local economies. The equation is simple: Healthy public lands mean healthy economies in this part of Oregon. And outside threats to those lands place local economies in peril. I understand that companies, including foreign companies, want to come into Southeastern Oregon to explore for minerals, including uranium. This is deeply troubling because these mining operations are dangerous--to the existing local economies as well as to the environment, over all. By potentially hamstringing the creation of jobs in agriculture and recreation, and stunting the growth of small businesses, blocking mining in these areas protects this local potential. Senator Merkley and I are introducing this bill because the risks posed by mineral exploration to the communities and their way of life are far too great to roll the dice. Not only does our bill protect more than 2 million acres from mineral exploration and extraction, it creates and expands programs to support Southeastern Oregon communities so they can grow their economies and build on their strengths. These programs include grants to develop modern and efficient water storage systems to keep livestock out of rivers and streams and reduce the need to transport water. They also include infrastructure grants to improve roads for farmers and agriculture-related businesses, as well as job training for veterans and young people get started in agriculture. Finally, our bill would address broader economic issues by establishing an Agriculture Center of Excellence to expand local agriculture research, providing additional assistance to local and rural firefighters, improving water and wastewater systems, and deploying broadband service and cellphone towers. With these investments in Southeastern Oregon, communities can create jobs, train a new generation of workers, and modernize their economies. All those gains can be achieved while protecting Malheur County's natural landscape and ensuring that the historic uses of the land can continue without interruption from harmful mining operations. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3796] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley): S. 3048.

A bill to withdraw certain Federal land located in Malheur County, Oregon, from all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws, location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and operation under the mineral leasing laws, to provide for the conduct of certain economic activities in Malheur County, Oregon, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Southeastern Oregon Mineral Withdrawal and Economic Preservation and Development Act to provide a boost to the rural Oregon economy and to protect the world-renowned Southeastern Oregon landscape. I am pleased to introduce this bill with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Jeff Merkley. In Southeastern Oregon, the high desert landscape is home to hundreds of millions of acres of public lands that have hosted cattle ranching and visitors and locals for generations. These lands are supported by Oregonians who grew up there and who rely on them as a long-time linchpin for their local economies. The equation is simple: Healthy public lands mean healthy economies in this part of Oregon. And outside threats to those lands place local economies in peril. I understand that companies, including foreign companies, want to come into Southeastern Oregon to explore for minerals, including uranium. This is deeply troubling because these mining operations are dangerous--to the existing local economies as well as to the environment, over all. By potentially hamstringing the creation of jobs in agriculture and recreation, and stunting the growth of small businesses, blocking mining in these areas protects this local potential. Senator Merkley and I are introducing this bill because the risks posed by mineral exploration to the communities and their way of life are far too great to roll the dice. Not only does our bill protect more than 2 million acres from mineral exploration and extraction, it creates and expands programs to support Southeastern Oregon communities so they can grow their economies and build on their strengths. These programs include grants to develop modern and efficient water storage systems to keep livestock out of rivers and streams and reduce the need to transport water. They also include infrastructure grants to improve roads for farmers and agriculture-related businesses, as well as job training for veterans and young people get started in agriculture. Finally, our bill would address broader economic issues by establishing an Agriculture Center of Excellence to expand local agriculture research, providing additional assistance to local and rural firefighters, improving water and wastewater systems, and deploying broadband service and cellphone towers. With these investments in Southeastern Oregon, communities can create jobs, train a new generation of workers, and modernize their economies.

ALAN S. LOWENTHAL of california in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, as Tony Budrovich readies to take the reins as president and CEO of the Catalina Island Conservancy, it is important to step back and look over the successful tenure of Ann M. Muscat, who announced her June 25 retirement last year. She has served as president and CEO for more than 13 years--the second longest tenure of any previous Conservancy president. Ann will continue to serve the Conservancy as its president emeritus until October 7, 2016. She will focus on serving as a resource to Tony, transitioning donor relationships, continuing fundraising for the Conservancy's first every capital campaign, IMAGINE CATALINA, and completing design of the new visitors' center, The Trailhead. ``Ann and the Conservancy have achieved a lot,'' Los Angeles County Supervisor Don Knabe said. ``I've had the great pleasure of working with Ann and her team, all of them consummate professionals who are dedicated to getting things done.'' ``Under Ann's leadership, the Conservancy has become a living laboratory of innovation in conservation, education and financial sustainability for nonprofit organizations,'' Catalina Island Conservancy Board of Directors Chair Stephen Chazen said. ``The Conservancy has significantly improved the Island's ecological health, greatly increased access to Catalina's wildlands and expanded and enhanced its educational programs to better serve students living in Avalon and visitors from the mainland.'' Here is a look back at how the Conservancy and its stewardship of Catalina Island have flourished since Muscat joined the organization in 2003. During Ann's 13-year tenure, and through its Catalina Habitat Improvement and Restoration Program (CHIRP), the Conservancy staff has completed vegetation mapping of the entire Island, including non-native and invasive plant species. It has controlled and eradicated numerous invasive plant species that were eliminating native and rare biodiversity. It also expanded the native plant nursery's scope to include landscaping initiatives on the Island, along with restoration, and significantly expanded the native seed collection. The Conservancy has been a leader in removing non-native and highly destructive animal species from the Island, leading to the rediscovery of native plants previously believed to be extinct. It also brought the Catalina Island fox back from the brink of extinction and supported the successful recovery of the bald eagle. Its wildlife biologists have implemented innovative social (repatriation) and scientific methodologies (contraception) for managing the bison herd. They also have conducted bird and small mammal surveys, discovering nesting sea birds on cliffs and nearby rocks, and implementing protective measures for bat populations. In addition, the Conservancy has pursued research partnerships with universities and museums from across the country, including a multi- institution collaboration that resulted in a comprehensive look at the Island's oak woodlands. Working with the Long Beach Unified School District, the community and philanthropic organizations, the Conservancy has greatly increased access to natural and intellectual resources over the past 13 years. It implemented extensive educational enrichment and internship programs for the local school population through the establishment of the K-12 NatureWorks workforce development and STEM education initiative. In its continuing service to the local community, the Conservancy provided free access to the wildlands of Catalina for Island families without vehicles. It implemented a free of charge Naturalist Training Program for tour operators and local businesses, as well as Conservancy front line staff. To ensure visitors to the Island could access the wildlands and learn about Catalina's ecosystem, the Conservancy created the 37.5 mile Trans-Catalina Trail. It also has secured funding and developed plans for further trail improvements and expansions. It significantly expanded and improved the Jeep Eco-Tour program and developed a signage and way finding system across the Island. It added new running and biking events, an Island Ecology Travel Program and Wild Side Art Program to increase access and awareness. In addition, it increased volunteer program initiatives to include AmeriCorps, American Conservation Experience and numerous university-level spring break programs. So that visitors and others had more information about Catalina Island and the Conservancy, it added a Nature Center in Avalon and a Mobile Nature Station that has served Avalon and Two Harbors, along with interpretive panels in the Garden and at campgrounds and trailheads. The Conservancy also expanded and revamped its outreach and marketing materials, including maps, field guides, monthly e- newsletters, videos, an extensive photo library and expanded web site. To serve a greater good beyond Catalina's shores, the Conservancy launched a successful radio show and web site, Isla Earth, on environmental issues that aired for 10 years on over 320 radio stations across the country. To provide the needed programs and ensure the organization's long- term financial health, the Conservancy has focused on raising revenues and creating a sustainable business model that will ensure the Island will continue to be restored and protected for future generations. In the past 13 years, the Conservancy has increased its operating budget nearly three times through an increase in philanthropic giving and mission-based earned income. It has significantly expanded its donor base and created a reserve fund to address deferred maintenance projects across its 42,000 acres. Projects have included improvements at Airport in the Sky, across its road and bridge system, a new pier, replacement and expansion of its vehicle fleet and upgrades to its numerous buildings. The Conservancy also revamped its organizational structure, adding new departments and expanding existing functions while providing professional development and training for all staff. The Conservancy's staff has doubled in size and moved to a more customer service/ community orientation. The Conservancy also expanded and updated employee housing, adding 14 new units, to support recruitment and retention of staff. The Board of Directors and the Conservancy's staff have worked together to develop a strategic vision for the organization's future, called IMAGINE CATALINA. They worked with nationally recognized sustainability architect William McDonough and landscape architect Thomas Woltz to develop a long-term strategic vision. It imagines an Island that represents California as it can be, demonstrating how nature and humans can thrive together. It envisions Catalina and the Conservancy serving as models for science-based conservation, for training tomorrow's stewards of the natural world, for connecting people to nature and for creating sustainable finances and operations. To implement IMAGINE CATALINA, the Board and staff launched the Conservancy's first-ever capital campaign, and they are more than three-fourths of the way to fully funding the first phase. They plan to celebrate the groundbreaking for the campaign's flagship project, The Trailhead Visitor Center, on June 24. Another groundbreaking is scheduled on October 14 for the next major project, improvement and expansion of Catalina's trail system, and planning is well underway for a major ecological restoration effort on the Island's West End. ``Ann and her team's excellent stewardship work at the Catalina Island Conservancy is leading edge and has served as a model for many other land trusts,'' said California Council of Land Trusts Executive Director Darla Guenzler. Ann has also been a leader beyond Catalina. She was a founding Board member of the California Council of Land Trusts and served as its Chair of the Board. She is also a member of the Steering Committee for the Southern California Open Space Council and an Advisory Board member of USC's Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies.

recognized sustainability architect william mcdonough and landscape architect thomas woltz to develop a long-term strategic vision. it imagines an island that represents california as it can be, demonstrating how nature and humans can thrive together. it envisions catalina and the conservancy serving as models for science-based conservation, for training tomorrow's stewards of the natural world, for connecting people to nature and for creating sustainable finances and operations. to implement imagine catalina, the board and staff launched the conservancy's first-ever capital campaign, and they are more than three-fourths of the way to fully funding the first phase. they plan to celebrate the groundbreaking for the campaign's flagship project, the trailhead visitor center, on june 24. another groundbreaking is scheduled on october 14 for the next major project, improvement and expansion of catalina's trail system, and planning is well underway for a major ecological restoration effort on the island's west end. ``ann and her team's excellent stewardship work at the catalina island conservancy is leading edge and has served as a model for many other land trusts,'' said california council of land trusts executive director darla guenzler. ann has also been a leader beyond catalina. she was a founding board member of the california council of land trusts and served as its chair of the board. she is also a member of the steering committee for the southern california open space council and an advisory board member of usc's wrigley institute for environmental studies.

CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, His Holiness the Dalai Lama will be in Washington, DC next week. As the spiritual leader of Tibetans, the Dalai Lama is an energetic and unfailing ambassador for human rights and the rights of the Tibetan people. Sadly, his visit reminds us again about the dire situation of the Tibetan people inside China. The Tibetan people have a right to practice their religion, preserve their culture, and speak their language. They have a right to do so without restriction or interference. The Chinese government does not agree. To them, the Tibetans are a people to be pacified. Their faith and culture are problems to be solved, not a heritage to be preserved, honored, and protected. To them, the Dalai Lama is an agitator and revolutionary, not a world-renowned and respected voice for peace and harmony. The recent State Department Human Rights Report offered a withering criticism of the Chinese government's oversight of Tibetan and Tibetan areas of China. It said the ``government engaged in severe repression of Tibet's religious, cultural and religious heritage by, among other means, strictly curtailing the civil rights of China's ethnic Tibetan population, including the rights to the freedom of speech, religion, association, assembly, and movement.'' I am the Chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. Our reporting on Tibet draws similar conclusions about China's rough oversight of Tibetans. Over the past several years, the Chinese government has constructed more obstacles to efforts by Tibetans to preserve their culture and religion. Sadly, we know that Tibetans have used self-immolations as a protest against the religious and political oversight of the Chinese government. It is difficult to fathom the despair and desperation felt by Tibetans who take this last act of defiance. The Chinese government has blamed the Dalai Lama and ``foreign forces'' for self-immolations instead of looking at how their own policies created such deep grievances. The Chinese government also expanded its efforts last year to transform Tibetan Buddhism into a state-managed institution. They sought to undermine the devotion of the Tibetan people to the Dalai Lama and control the process of selecting Buddhist leaders. One Chinese government official admitted that control over the selection of Tibetan Buddhist leaders, including the next Dalai Lama, was ``an important political matter'' and a critical part of the Chinese government's ``sovereignty over Tibet.'' The Chinese government wants a Tibetan Buddhism that is attractive to tourists, but which allows the Communist Party to completely manage its affairs. The UN Special Rapporteur on Religion said recently criticized China's efforts to control Tibetan Buddhism and the process of selecting leaders. He said ``the Chinese government is destroying the autonomy of religious communities . . . creating schisms, and pitting people against each other in order to exercise control.'' This is exactly what the Chinese government has done to other religious groups, including Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, and Falun Gong. When the faithful don't fall in line, they are jailed, harassed and bribed until they do. Religious freedom is an essential part of dealing with the grievances of the Tibetan people, but China's answer is always the same--control, manage, and repress. It is counterproductive and it violates China's international obligations. The China Commission has a prisoner database that contains records on 643 known Tibetan political and religious prisoners. 43 percent of those detained are monks, nuns, and religious teachers. Almost all were imprisoned since 2008. Substantive dialogue between the Dalai Lama's representatives and the Chinese government and Communist Party have not occurred in the past five years. This is the longest break since the dialogue started in 2002. A government ``White Paper'' on Tibet, published this April, states that China will ``only talk with private representatives of the Dalai Lama'' to discuss ``the future of the Dalai Lama'' and how he can ``gain the forgiveness of the central government and the Chinese people.'' Instead of asking for the Dalai Lama's forgiveness for the decades of brutal repression, the Chinese government asks for his. This is the state of affairs in Xi Jinping's China. This is unfortunate and counterproductive. If China's goal is to build a ``harmonious society'' in Tibet, it cannot be done without the Dalai Lama. He is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. His views are widely shared by those in Tibetan society, he can be a constructive partner for China in addressing continuing tensions, and deep-seated grievance, in Tibetan areas. In our dealings with Chinese government and officials, Members of Congress and the Administration should affirm the peaceful desires of the Tibetan people for greater autonomy and freedoms within China. We should stress that China's policies are counterproductive, they are brutal, and they hurt China's international prestige. We also need to speak with a unified voice to end the repression of the Tibetan people. U.S. leadership on this issue is critical, because our allies in Europe and Asia can be bullied by Chinese threats of economic boycotts. U.S. officials must demonstrate that Tibet matters, human rights matter, and religious freedom matters to U.S.-China relations and China's future stability and prosperity. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E878] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TIBET AND THE VISIT OF HIS HOLINESS THE DALI LAMA TO WASHINGTON, D.C. ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today to recognize Dr. Ella White Campbell--a passionate educator who devoted her life to improving the lives of her neighbors. A South Carolina native, Dr. Campbell moved to Maryland at a young age and graduated at the top of her class from the historic Wiley H. Bates High School in Annapolis while helping to care for her siblings. She later earned three degrees--including one Doctoral Degree--from Morgan State University, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland. Dr. Campbell began her teaching career at a middle school in the Cherry Hill neighborhood of Baltimore City, where residents were so impressed with her leadership abilities, they asked her/ take over the local recreation center. She eventually chaired the city's English Department and was promoted to Assistant Principal. She helped design a curriculum that increased test scores of hundreds of students. You would be hard pressed to find a community organization that Dr. Campbell did not, at some point, belong to or lead. While too numerous to mention in their entirety, Dr Campbell was President of the Gwynnvale Civic Association, President of the Liberty Road Community Council, President of the Liberty Randallstown Coalition, President of the Stevenswood Improvement Association and Founder of the Randallstown NAACP chapter. Dr. Campbell advocated tirelessly for better schools, recreation facilities, libraries and public transportation in her community. I had the privilege of working with Dr. Campbell for many years. Believe me, you did not want to find yourself on the wrong side of Dr. Campbell because you can bet she had already briefed the community on her position--and convinced them to agree. She was instrumental in securing $1 million to implement the Liberty Road Streetscape Project, helped to stop area flooding through the Red Run Dam project and established the Liberty Assistance Center for county residents in need. A decorated member of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Dr. Campbell is listed in the Who's Who in The East, Who's Who in America and Community Leaders of the World. Perhaps most importantly, she was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join with me today to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Ella White Campbell. Although she will be sorely missed, Dr. Campbell's impact on Baltimore County and people's lives--including my own--will last forever. She was a true inspiration. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E879] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DR.

Believe me, you did not want to find yourself on the wrong side of Dr. Campbell because you can bet she had already briefed the community on her position--and convinced them to agree. She was instrumental in securing $1 million to implement the Liberty Road Streetscape Project, helped to stop area flooding through the Red Run Dam project and established the Liberty Assistance Center for county residents in need. A decorated member of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Dr. Campbell is listed in the Who's Who in The East, Who's Who in America and Community Leaders of the World. Perhaps most importantly, she was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join with me today to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Ella White Campbell. Although she will be sorely missed, Dr. Campbell's impact on Baltimore County and people's lives--including my own--will last forever. She was a true inspiration. ____________________",package_114_182.csv,2861,2861,2927,"[congressional record volume 162, number 92 (friday, june 10, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e879] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring dr. ella white campbell ______ hon. c.a. dutch ruppersberger of maryland in the house of representatives friday, june 10, 2016 mr. ruppersberger. mr. speaker, i rise before you today to recognize dr. ella white campbell--a passionate educator who devoted her life to improving the lives of her neighbors. a south carolina native, dr. campbell moved to maryland at a young age and graduated at the top of her class from the historic wiley h. bates high school in annapolis while helping to care for her siblings. she later earned three degrees--including one doctoral degree--from morgan state university, johns hopkins university and the university of maryland. dr. campbell began her teaching career at a middle school in the cherry hill neighborhood of baltimore city, where residents were so impressed with her leadership abilities, they asked her/ take over the local recreation center. she eventually chaired the city's english department and was promoted to assistant principal. she helped design a curriculum that increased test scores of hundreds of students. you would be hard pressed to find a community organization that dr. campbell did not, at some point, belong to or lead. while too numerous to mention in their entirety, dr campbell was president of the gwynnvale civic association, president of the liberty road community council, president of the liberty randallstown coalition, president of the stevenswood improvement association and founder of the randallstown naacp chapter. dr. campbell advocated tirelessly for better schools, recreation facilities, libraries and public transportation in her community. i had the privilege of working with dr. campbell for many years. believe me, you did not want to find yourself on the wrong side of dr. campbell because you can bet she had already briefed the community on her position--and convinced them to agree. she was instrumental in securing $1 million to implement the liberty road streetscape project, helped to stop area flooding through the red run dam project and established the liberty assistance center for county residents in need. a decorated member of the delta sigma theta sorority, dr. campbell is listed in the who's who in the east, who's who in america and community leaders of the world. perhaps most importantly, she was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. mr. speaker, i ask that you join with me today to honor the life and legacy of dr. ella white campbell. although she will be sorely missed, dr. campbell's impact on baltimore county and people's lives--including my own--will last forever. she was a true inspiration. ____________________",2861

MIKE THOMPSON of california in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to rise today to pay tribute to California's Fifth Congressional District as home to recipients of the Purple Heart. So many of our residents have honorably served our nation in its time of need. As a reflection of Northern California's role in war efforts past and present and the deep personal sacrifice of so many of our residents, I stand to assert that California's Fifth Congressional District should be recognized as a ``Purple Heart District.'' The Purple Heart is one of the oldest and most recognized American military medals, awarded to service members who were killed or wounded by enemy action. In 1782, George Washington created the Badge of Military Merit to reward ``any singularly meritorious action'' displayed by a soldier, non-commissioned officer, or officer in the Continental Army. This award was intended to encourage gallantry and fidelity among soldiers. General Douglas MacArthur (then Army Chief of Staff) revived the award on February 22, 1932, the 200th anniversary of George Washington's birth. Since its inception and through several wars and conflicts, the Purple Heart has been given to an estimated 1.8 million military members wounded or killed while serving our nation. I received my Purple Heart while serving in the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam. California has a strong military tradition, home to many significant installations and countless remarkable individuals. Our district includes the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard--the first U.S. Navy base on the Pacific coast--and is adjacent to Travis Air Force Base, which handles more cargo and passengers than any other military air terminal in the United States. Many notable veterans have called our district home, including pioneering pilot and General of the Army and Air Force Henry ``Hap'' Arnold. Over 45,000 veterans currently reside in our district, including thousands from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, who are living with the wounds of war at higher rates than any other conflict in our history. I am honored to represent all of these valiant men and women. Mr. Speaker, California has dispatched thousands of its sons and daughters to fight the enemy. Many have sacrificed their health, and many have sacrificed their lives. We will never forget their sacrifices and are grateful for the brave men and women who have been harmed defending our country and our freedom. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognition and appreciation of California's Purple Heart recipients past and present. Now, in the spirit of that appreciation, let it be known that California's Fifth Congressional District should be recognized as a ``Purple Heart District.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E880] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PURPLE HEART DISTRICT ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Florida Chamber of Commerce on their 100th anniversary and for their tireless efforts to secure Florida's future. On April 29th, 1916, The Florida Chamber was founded to help support the Florida business community. At the time, many businesses were faltering and the agriculture industry, the state's leading economic source, was struggling with a cattle tick that was threatening livestock. The chamber was created with the goal of securing that state's future by preserving our vital agriculture industry and creating jobs and economic opportunities. Today, Florida's economic challenges have changed, but the Chamber's mission has always remained the same: securing Florida's economic future. In the past 100 years, Florida has developed into an economic powerhouse with the support of the Florida Chamber of Commerce. Today, Florida's economy accounts for 1 in 12 jobs being created in the United States and independently the Floridian economy is the 18th largest market in the world. As the population continues to grow and diversify Florida's economy and population of roughly 19 million residents to continue to enrich our nation's economy. The primary goal of the Chamber has been to promote a business- friendly atmosphere in order to attract employees with highly specialized skills and continue to aid our economy. The Chamber has done that and more for Florida and our community of Pinellas as well. It has strengthened our agriculture industry, embraced the military and defense industry, promoted technology and innovation, advanced education, and strengthened our infrastructure. Even though the main industries in our community and state are agriculture, tourism, and construction, the Chamber is helping ensure that we are looking towards a more diverse economy with life sciences and biotech, energy, international trade, and advanced manufacturing and space technologies. With our state ever increasing in population, we can feel secure that the Florida Chamber will continue to create jobs and opportunities. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our Florida Chamber for maintaining their goal of nurturing and supporting business within Florida. I ask that this body join me in recognizing what the Florida Chamber has done for the Florida economy in the past 100 years and will continue to do in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E880] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO FLORIDA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ______ HON.

DAVID W. JOLLY of florida in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Florida Chamber of Commerce on their 100th anniversary and for their tireless efforts to secure Florida's future. On April 29th, 1916, The Florida Chamber was founded to help support the Florida business community. At the time, many businesses were faltering and the agriculture industry, the state's leading economic source, was struggling with a cattle tick that was threatening livestock. The chamber was created with the goal of securing that state's future by preserving our vital agriculture industry and creating jobs and economic opportunities. Today, Florida's economic challenges have changed, but the Chamber's mission has always remained the same: securing Florida's economic future. In the past 100 years, Florida has developed into an economic powerhouse with the support of the Florida Chamber of Commerce. Today, Florida's economy accounts for 1 in 12 jobs being created in the United States and independently the Floridian economy is the 18th largest market in the world. As the population continues to grow and diversify Florida's economy and population of roughly 19 million residents to continue to enrich our nation's economy. The primary goal of the Chamber has been to promote a business- friendly atmosphere in order to attract employees with highly specialized skills and continue to aid our economy. The Chamber has done that and more for Florida and our community of Pinellas as well. It has strengthened our agriculture industry, embraced the military and defense industry, promoted technology and innovation, advanced education, and strengthened our infrastructure. Even though the main industries in our community and state are agriculture, tourism, and construction, the Chamber is helping ensure that we are looking towards a more diverse economy with life sciences and biotech, energy, international trade, and advanced manufacturing and space technologies.

JAMES P. McGOVERN of massachusetts in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of Patrick Oroszko of Worcester, Massachusetts. Pat passed away on Sunday following a brave and inspirational battle with esophageal cancer. He was just 34 years old. I first met Pat several years ago when he interned in my Washington, DC office. He was exceptional. He was whip smart and detailed oriented. Pat made you feel comfortable the moment you started talking to him. He was easy-going and unassuming, despite his height. And above all, he was kind. Born and raised in Worcester, Pat graduated from St. John's High School in Shrewsbury where he excelled in basketball. He went on to receive degrees from Clark University and Anna Maria College. It was at Clark University that Pat truly felt at home. While at Clark, he was a member of the school's basketball team which qualified for the postseason in all four of his years and made it to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Division III tournament two years. He served as team captain his junior and senior years. Most recently, Pat served as Director of Student Recruitment for Clark's Graduate School and, for the past seven years, as an Assistant Men's Basketball Coach. And Clark is where Pat met the love of his life and best friend, Courtney. Today, it's the Clark University basketball gymnasium--the Kneller Athletic Center--where family and friends will gather to celebrate his life. It was one of Pat's favorite places. And at his request, the gym will be set up just as it would be for a game day, with the bleachers pulled out, home and visitor benches, the scoring table and the scoreboard on. [[Page E881]] Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my deepest sympathy to Pat's wife Courtney; his young children, Allison and Ryan; his parents, Charlie and Linda; his brother, Chris and all of his extended family and friends and the entire Clark University family. Mr. Speaker, Pat Oroszko was a wonderful person who touched so many lives. And we're all going to miss him immensely. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E880-E881] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE OF PATRICK OROSZKO ______ HON.

CON. RES. 89 AND H. CON. RES. 112 ______ HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the two resolutions brought to the floor today, H. Con. Res. 89 and H. Con. Res. 112. These resolutions are a time-wasting distraction from the real work that this Congress should be doing--finding ways to invest in America, grow paychecks and create good jobs for the middle class and those struggling to get by. The oil fee and carbon tax are two proposals to address the problem of climate change and, in the case of the oil fee, provide needed funds for infrastructure reform. While we can debate the merits of these particular approaches, at least they are efforts to take on real challenges facing our country and the world. Instead, the majority simply wants to stick their heads in the sand and wish these challenges away. That may appease their Trump Tea Party base, but it represents a total lack of leadership. And make no mistake, inaction on climate change does not just risk our future--it is costing us today. The increase in extreme weather events is hitting Americans in the pocketbook, through higher insurance rates and home repair costs, and this will only get worse from our failure to act. The greater harm is through the missed opportunity to create high-paying jobs for American workers. We can be the world's green-economy leader, supporting millions of new jobs in research and manufacturing in the process, but it requires Congress to act. Republicans would rather we sit on the sidelines while other countries seek the mantle of climate-change leader, and those countries reap the benefit of high-paying technology jobs that will come with it. Now, we should have a discussion on the best ways to boost our economy by combatting climate change, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, and finding ways to properly invest in our nation's infrastructure. In that vein, I've introduced the Healthy Climate and Family Security Act, a cap-and-dividend plan that would help us combat climate change and support economic growth and a thriving middle class. It boosts the purchasing power of families in Maryland and across the country while achieving the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions necessary to address the economic and health risks of climate change, using a market-based approach. Similarly, last year I introduced the GROW AMERICA Act, a bill which would boost infrastructure spending and help pay for it by closing the egregious inversions loophole which allows corporations to shift their tax obligations onto hard-working Americans just by changing their mailing address. My Democratic colleagues have many other thoughtful ideas on how we can address these important issues. But today's resolutions are not a thoughtful discussion on addressing climate change or funding our infrastructure--in the text of these resolutions, the terms ``climate change'' and ``infrastructure'' are nowhere to be seen. In fact, these resolutions are a waste of time meant to appease the Trump Tea Party base. The American people need us to do our job, so let's get to the real work of creating broadly shared prosperity. I urge my colleagues to vote no. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E881] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OPPOSITION TO H.

DAVID W. JOLLY of florida in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Principal Michael Feeney for his efforts in improving one of our local schools, Oldsmar Elementary. On May 17th 2016, Mr. Feeney received an award from the Oldsmar City Council for his exemplary work. Mr. Feeney began his career in education at Oldsmar Elementary as a teacher, but soon after starting he realized that school administration was his calling. He assumed the role of Assistant Principal for two years and was promoted to Principal for another four years. Under Mr. Feeney's guidance, Oldsmar Elementary has gone from a ``C'' to an ``A'' grade school and his efforts have changed the lives of so many children and families throughout our community. Although Mr. Feeney will be leaving Oldsmar Elementary to serve at another school, his dedication to excellence and commitment to his students has left a lasting legacy at Oldsmar Elementary I ask that this body join me in recognizing Mr. Feeney's accomplishments and wish him the best of luck as he begins the next chapter of his life. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E881] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO PRINCIPAL MICHAEL FEENEY ______ HON.

On May 17th 2016, Mr. Feeney received an award from the Oldsmar City Council for his exemplary work. Mr. Feeney began his career in education at Oldsmar Elementary as a teacher, but soon after starting he realized that school administration was his calling. He assumed the role of Assistant Principal for two years and was promoted to Principal for another four years. Under Mr. Feeney's guidance, Oldsmar Elementary has gone from a ``C'' to an ``A'' grade school and his efforts have changed the lives of so many children and families throughout our community. Although Mr. Feeney will be leaving Oldsmar Elementary to serve at another school, his dedication to excellence and commitment to his students has left a lasting legacy at Oldsmar Elementary I ask that this body join me in recognizing Mr. Feeney's accomplishments and wish him the best of luck as he begins the next chapter of his life. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E881] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO PRINCIPAL MICHAEL FEENEY ______ HON.

TONY CARDENAS of california in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise to honor the life and legacy of Helen Chavez, who passed away on Monday, June 6, 2016. Helen was a civil rights icon in her own right, and the widow of one of my heroes, Cesar Chavez. Throughout her life, Helen Chavez faced many challenges, yet she had a fierce determination and always kept moving forward. When she was just 12 years old, Helen's father passed away. In order to help her mother support her five siblings, Helen began working in the California fields. Later, Helen went on to meet the love of her life, Cesar, and became a caring mother to their eight children in East Los Angeles. However, it was her passion for Cesar's initiative to bring justice to farm workers that inspired her to return to Delano to work in the fields. Helen devoted her life to civil rights by bringing awareness to the cause. She inspired people to join the initiative to fight for farmworker rights. Helen and Cesar formed the United Farmworkers Union where Helen worked tirelessly running the credit union put in place for the workers. And when times were tough, Helen did not back down. She turned to her faith for words of encouragement. She never gave up. With Helen's encouragement and unconditional support, Cesar went on to inspire a labor movement of farmworkers that would go on to level the playing field in the conflict over the right to form a union. This led to the most powerful and significant alliance between unions and communities in the modern day labor movement. It is clear that Helen was more than a mother and a wife. She had an essential part in the accomplishments of her husband. Helen Chavez is one of this country's greatest advocates. She helped bring human rights to the forefront. Her quiet resiliency drove the heart of this movement. As the son of farmworkers from the Central Valley, her work and Cesar's initiative have made it possible for me to become a Congressman. The outcome of my life and the lives of millions of Americans who come from farmworkers and families in the labor industry are forever changed because of their fearless pursuit of justice. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the life of Helen Chavez. Her legacy is a testament to the greatness that is these United States of America. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E881] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN MEMORY OF HELEN CHAVEZ ______ HON.

On June 6th 1916, twelve men, agreeing to the principles and objectives of the IBEW, received their official charter for IBEW Local 252. At the time, working conditions for laborers and trades workers were deplorable. In that era, the death rate for an electrician was more than twice the death rate for trades workers in other industries. It was commonplace that workers in many trades toiled under twelve hour work days for six or seven days a week, with substandard wages and few if any benefits, not to mention training or workplace safety rules. One hundred years later, we have workplace rules, training, safety, fair wages and benefits, and this would not be the case if not for the vision and courage of these original founders, which is why we celebrate this very important milestone. What those founders were fighting for then, and what these union members are fighting for now is a shot at the American dream, a dream that we all must continue to protect for future generations. Today, under the leadership of Business Manager Tim Hutchens, IBEW Local 252 has grown to a membership of over 800 men and women and continues to grow. Local 252 provides the best trained and most experienced Electricians for many of the most important construction projects in the area. Whether the projects are at the University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University, or elsewhere, if the job needs to get done right and done right the first time, you call on Local 252 members. With this high level of commitment to quality and skill, it is no wonder that this local has grown over the years to become what it is today. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today to celebrate the 100th anniversary of IBEW Local 252, and I know we will be celebrating the accomplishments of this local for many years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E882] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF IBEW LOCAL 252 ______ HON.

DAVID W. JOLLY of florida in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Tarpon Springs Public Library for its 100 years of service to Pinellas County. In 1916, Julia Inness started the library in the original City Hall inviting Pinellas residents to explore the exciting world that books provide and engage in meaningful literary dialogue. The library became even more popular than Ms. Inness had predicted, and in 1920, it was moved for the first time to a private home that had more space. As the library expanded, it moved again to the Shaw Arcade and then again to the Tarpon Hotel. In 1964, the ``Friends of the Tarpon Springs Public Library'' organization, which continues to support the library today, was formed with the intention of helping fund special enhancements to the library. Finally in 1997, the Library's current location, a twenty- thousand square foot building on East Lemon Street, was constructed. In 1989, the Library joined the Pinellas Public Library Cooperative. The co-op helped equip the library with the necessary materials to serve the diverse population that used the library's services. While there are still local regulars who frequent the library, it has evolved into a very busy and multi-purpose space thanks to the help of the co- op. The Library also hosts a variety of programs for Pinellas residents including the Public Arts Program and the Cultural and Civic Services program. Additionally, due to the contributions from the Friends of the Tarpon Springs Public Library organization, the Library has been updated with a new audio visual system, new computers, and resources for genealogy research. The Library has also been improving its digital correspondence, providing an online catalog allowing people out of county and state to access the Library. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the Tarpon Springs Library on an impressive 100 years and thank them for continuing to provide a valuable service to our community. I am very excited to see what future the Library has in store for us in the next 100 years and ask this body to join me in recognizing the Tarpon Springs Library as a cornerstone of the Pinellas County community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E882] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO TARPON SPRINGS LIBRARY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Rabbi Michael Zedek, who has retired after being the spiritual leader since 2004 at Emanuel Congregation in the 9th Congressional District of Illinois. He will be missed. Rabbi Zedek is a true community leader and has brought neighbors together, fostered open-mindedness and embraced the incredible diversity of our community. Ordained in June 1974, Rabbi Zedek was chosen to be alumnus-in- residence at the Cincinnati and Los Angeles campuses of Hebrew [[Page E883]] Union College. Rabbi Zedek is the youngest man to receive this honor. He served as CEO of the Jewish Federation of Cincinnati and as the spiritual leader of Congregation B'nai Jehudah in Kansas City, Missouri for 26 years, where he holds the title of Rabbi Emeritus. During his tenure, the Jewish Federation of Cincinnati received national awards for innovative fundraising and programming. Prior to his service at the Jewish Federation of Cincinnati, Rabbi Zedek was the senior rabbi of Temple B'nai Jehudah in Kansas City, Missouri where he served for many years. Rabbi Zedek is a truly dedicated community activist, scholar, and teacher. He is deeply involved in civic affairs having served on a number of national and international boards. He has also had numerous teaching and speaking appointments around the world on a wide range of topics, especially focusing on spirituality and folklore. He has taught and lectured in South Africa, Russia, China, the former Yugoslavia, and Israel and in many other countries. He received a Danforth Graduate Fellowship for outstanding teaching, a Fulbright-Hays Grant for advanced study in the United Kingdom, and is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Hamilton College, Clinton, New York. He will still speak internationally on spirituality and folklore and remain a regular presenter at Rancho La Puerta, a spirituality and retreat center, in Tecate, Mexico. He also serves as the host of a radio show, ``Religion on the Line,'' which has been on the air for more than 20 years. I thank Rabbi Zedek for his leadership and service. I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring Rabbi Zedek for the work he has done for his congregation, the community, the 9th Congressional District and beyond. We thank him for his invaluable service, and wish him well in all future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E882-E883] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING RABBI MICHAEL ZEDEK ______ HON.

CREC-2016-06-10-pt1-PgE883,CREC-2016-06-10,114,HONORING TOUGALOO COLLEGE/DELTA HEALTHPARTNERS HEALTHY START INITIATIVE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E883] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING TOUGALOO COLLEGE/DELTA HEALTHPARTNERS HEALTHY START INITIATIVE ______ HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable public health program designed to reduce infant mortality in the Mississippi Delta, the Tougaloo College/Delta HealthPartners Healthy Start Initiative. This initiative is one of the 100 Healthy Start Initiatives throughout the nation working endlessly to give every child a healthy start in life. The Delta HealthPartners' Healthy Start program is housed under the auspices of Tougaloo College within the George A. and Ruth B. Owens Health and Wellness Center, under the direction of Dr. Sandra Carr Hayes, the executive director. The program serves a rural population in a seven county area in the Mississippi Delta (Tunica, Coahoma, Quitman, Tallahatchie, Sunflower, Bolivar, and Washington counties). These counties are among the poorest and most medically underserved in Mississippi and the nation. The Healthy Start Initiative was implemented in 1999 with funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration under the leadership of Dr. Beverly W. Hogan, who now serves as President of Tougaloo College. Today, Ms. Arletha Howard serves as the project director. Ms. Howard is a registered nurse with over 28 years of experience in oncology, burn trauma, intensive care unit, pediatrics, home health, maternal and child health. She has worked with the Healthy Start Initiative for 16 years. In 2014, under Mrs. Howard's leadership, the Healthy Start Initiative was upgraded from a Level I individual based program to a Level II community based program. Since its inception, the Healthy Start Initiative has provided case management services through a home visiting model to (1) high-risk pregnant women of childbearing age 10-44 years, (2) their infants; and (3) fathers/co-parents. Over the past 16 years, the program has achieved several major accomplishments: The Healthy Start Initiative has case managed over 900 mothers and infants just this past calendar year (January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015). The Healthy Start Initiative has created the Coahoma County Community Action Network responsible for opening the first Diaper Bank in the state of Mississippi funded by charitable donations and Northwest Mississippi Foundation. The Healthy Start Initiative serves as the lead agency in partnership with the Mississippi State Department of Health in the Mississippi Delta Regional Fetal Infant Mortality Review program. The Healthy Start Initiative has created Memorandums of Understandings (MOU) with 22 partnering schools in the Mississippi Delta to provide peer support groups to pregnant/parenting teens and co-parents. The Healthy Start Initiative has been featured in numerous publications and articles (USA Today, Hechinger Report, Huffington Post, Clarksdale Press Register, Tunica Times, and WABG TV Interview) highlighting the comprehensive services of the project. The Healthy Start Initiative has partnered with Parents for Public Schools to provide trainings for project parents on advocacy skills and educating and mobilizing parents to strengthen public schools. The Healthy Start Initiative promotes breastfeeding in two (2) clinic sites by providing health education by project's Certified Lactation Counselors (Women's Clinic-Clarksdale, MS and Gamble Clinic-Greenville, MS).

BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable public health program designed to reduce infant mortality in the Mississippi Delta, the Tougaloo College/Delta HealthPartners Healthy Start Initiative. This initiative is one of the 100 Healthy Start Initiatives throughout the nation working endlessly to give every child a healthy start in life. The Delta HealthPartners' Healthy Start program is housed under the auspices of Tougaloo College within the George A. and Ruth B. Owens Health and Wellness Center, under the direction of Dr. Sandra Carr Hayes, the executive director. The program serves a rural population in a seven county area in the Mississippi Delta (Tunica, Coahoma, Quitman, Tallahatchie, Sunflower, Bolivar, and Washington counties). These counties are among the poorest and most medically underserved in Mississippi and the nation. The Healthy Start Initiative was implemented in 1999 with funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration under the leadership of Dr. Beverly W. Hogan, who now serves as President of Tougaloo College. Today, Ms. Arletha Howard serves as the project director. Ms. Howard is a registered nurse with over 28 years of experience in oncology, burn trauma, intensive care unit, pediatrics, home health, maternal and child health. She has worked with the Healthy Start Initiative for 16 years. In 2014, under Mrs. Howard's leadership, the Healthy Start Initiative was upgraded from a Level I individual based program to a Level II community based program. Since its inception, the Healthy Start Initiative has provided case management services through a home visiting model to (1) high-risk pregnant women of childbearing age 10-44 years, (2) their infants; and (3) fathers/co-parents. Over the past 16 years, the program has achieved several major accomplishments: The Healthy Start Initiative has case managed over 900 mothers and infants just this past calendar year (January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015). The Healthy Start Initiative has created the Coahoma County Community Action Network responsible for opening the first Diaper Bank in the state of Mississippi funded by charitable donations and Northwest Mississippi Foundation. The Healthy Start Initiative serves as the lead agency in partnership with the Mississippi State Department of Health in the Mississippi Delta Regional Fetal Infant Mortality Review program. The Healthy Start Initiative has created Memorandums of Understandings (MOU) with 22 partnering schools in the Mississippi Delta to provide peer support groups to pregnant/parenting teens and co-parents. The Healthy Start Initiative has been featured in numerous publications and articles (USA Today, Hechinger Report, Huffington Post, Clarksdale Press Register, Tunica Times, and WABG TV Interview) highlighting the comprehensive services of the project. The Healthy Start Initiative has partnered with Parents for Public Schools to provide trainings for project parents on advocacy skills and educating and mobilizing parents to strengthen public schools. The Healthy Start Initiative promotes breastfeeding in two (2) clinic sites by providing health education by project's Certified Lactation Counselors (Women's Clinic-Clarksdale, MS and Gamble Clinic-Greenville, MS). The Healthy Start Initiative hosts a Community Baby Shower in partnership with local hospitals, Federally Qualified Community Health Centers (FQHC), other health care providers and key stakeholders each year in September to promote awareness of infant mortality during National Infant Mortality Awareness Month.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Marc Stepp, who passed away on June 3rd, 2016, at the age of 93. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. Born on January 31st, 1923, in Versailles, Kentucky, he grew up in Evansville, Indiana before coming to Detroit. He was a graduate of the University of Detroit and a U.S. Army veteran. Marc now rests as a legend of the labor movement--one of the greatest friends to working people that our nation has ever known. I speak here for Detroit, for the members of the United Automobile Workers Union, and the people whose lives he has touched, when I say that we will miss him dearly. I stand before you today as the Dean of the Congress because when I was a young man, Marc Stepp stood up for me. He provided me crucial guidance, support, and advice as I sought elected office, and throughout my career he has inspired me to fight harder with his own dedication to securing jobs, justice, and peace for all people. [[Page E884]] The first African American to lead negotiations with a major Detroit automaker, the second African American member of the United Automobile Workers International Board, and an organizer who fought alongside my father to secure collective bargaining at the major automakers, Marc helped create the reality of an American middle class. Countless workers owed their jobs and the lives and families those jobs made possible to his efforts. His work to save Chrysler in the late 1970s and early 1980s preserved a proud American manufacture who might have otherwise faded away. Marc's legacy of advocacy though was not limited to collective bargaining alone. He helped shape movements to secure healthcare for the disadvantaged by establishing the Community Health Association, to elevate our discourse on race as part of the NAACP, and to end apartheid in South Africa. Indeed, some twenty years after helping me get elected to Congress, he helped get me arrested protesting apartheid in front of South Africa's Washington, D.C. embassy--a fight that would be won ten years later when Nelson Mandela became President of South Africa. The legacy Marc Stepp leaves us goes beyond the wages and conditions he secured and the rights he helped ensure for all. He will remain an example of how to live our lives for generations. He will continue to influence the fight for jobs, justice, and peace through those who he inspired and influenced. He may be gone but he will not be forgotten. I am thankful for his service and his friendship, as are all who knew him and called him friend. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E883-E884] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN REMEMBRANCE OF MARC STEPP ______ HON.

[[page e884]] the first african american to lead negotiations with a major detroit automaker, the second african american member of the united automobile workers international board, and an organizer who fought alongside my father to secure collective bargaining at the major automakers, marc helped create the reality of an american middle class. countless workers owed their jobs and the lives and families those jobs made possible to his efforts. his work to save chrysler in the late 1970s and early 1980s preserved a proud american manufacture who might have otherwise faded away. marc's legacy of advocacy though was not limited to collective bargaining alone. he helped shape movements to secure healthcare for the disadvantaged by establishing the community health association, to elevate our discourse on race as part of the naacp, and to end apartheid in south africa. indeed, some twenty years after helping me get elected to congress, he helped get me arrested protesting apartheid in front of south africa's washington, d.c. embassy--a fight that would be won ten years later when nelson mandela became president of south africa. the legacy marc stepp leaves us goes beyond the wages and conditions he secured and the rights he helped ensure for all. he will remain an example of how to live our lives for generations. he will continue to influence the fight for jobs, justice, and peace through those who he inspired and influenced. he may be gone but he will not be forgotten. i am thankful for his service and his friendship, as are all who knew him and called him friend. ____________________",2929

FISHER ______ HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a God-fearing and impressionistic man, Pastor Casey D. Fisher. Pastor Fisher has shown what can be done through tenacity, dedication and a desire to serve God. A Spirit-fed and Spirit-led minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, Pastor Casey D. Fisher was born in Utica, Mississippi, on July 8, 1966. He is the son of Sharkey and Katie Fisher. He received his formal education from the Hinds County School system and graduated from Utica High School in 1984. He attended the University of Southern Mississippi, where he majored in Business Administration. He later received a Bachelor in Religious Education, a Masters of Divinity and a Doctorate of Ministry from Living Word Bible Institution in Tyler, Texas. Pastor Fisher is married to the former Michele Chambers. They were married on September 17, 1988. He is the father of three lovely children: twin sons, Bryan and Ryan and a daughter, Casey Michele. Pastor Fisher finds time to love and care for his family as Christ does the church. He is devoted to strengthening them and helping them to grow in their everyday walk with the Lord, just as he does with the church. Pastor Fisher has served his country as a soldier in the United States Army. During this time, he truly accepted Jesus Christ as his personal savior on October 23, 1993 in Livorno, Italy. He served eight years in the U.S. Army, where he was part of two tours in Southwest Asia. He departed military service in July 1997. Afterwards, he was employed with the U.S. Postal Service in Vicksburg, Mississippi, where he recently retired in December, 2010. He is currently a Life Member of the Vicksburg Alumni Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. and serves as the Guide Right Chairman. His purpose is Achievement, in which he mentors young men, twelve through eighteen years of age, providing them with tutoring, community involvement and religious principles. He is also a member of Masonic Order of Prince Hall Free and Accepted Mason. In 1984, Pastor Fisher became the first known athlete in Mississippi to be selected All-State in four sports. While attending University of Southern Mississippi, he was a member of the basketball team, in which he led the Golden Eagles to the NIT championship in 1987 and later was inducted into the USM hall of fame. Although he loves basketball, he also has a passion for golfing. Dr. Fisher is a die-hard fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and the Dallas Cowboys. Pastor Fisher's motto is ``If you don't take it personal, it will make you a better person''. He is inspired by one of the Greatest Ministers, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., because of his willingness to serve and his willingness to give up his life for humanity. Greater Grove Street M. B. Church has stood the test of time through dedication, faith, stewardship, and commitment from this soldier on the battlefield for the Lord. He is a man of integrity, loyalty, dignity, and honesty leading his people to do the will of God. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Pastor Casey D. Fisher for his dedication to God, family, community and country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E884] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING PASTOR CASEY D.

CREC-2016-06-10-pt1-PgE884-3,CREC-2016-06-10,114,INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION EXPANDING THE YELLOW RIBBON PROGRAM,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E884-E885] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION EXPANDING THE YELLOW RIBBON PROGRAM ______ HON. CORRINE BROWN of florida in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program. For too long, through too many wars and too many deployments, we have treated our active duty servicemembers and their families as expendable once their usefulness on the battlefield has ended. We hear too many stories of members of the military who do not have the right tools to adapt back into civilian life. The Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program was aimed at helping address the unique challenges facing the National Guard and Reserve Component community during this transition. The Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program has helped these Guard and Reserve servicemembers with: accessing benefits, geographic isolation, lack of access to military family support groups in local communities, continued and repeated deployments, and unemployment and underemployment. The Yellow Ribbon program has also helped to educate servicemembers on the rigors of deployment, implement reintegration curriculum throughout the deployment cycle, and inform servicemembers and their families about the resources available and connect members to service providers who can assist them in overcoming the challenges of reintegration. The Yellow Ribbon program has been successful in making sure the backbone of our society, those men and women who pursue their chosen profession, but also choose the military as an obligation to secure the liberties and freedoms we hold most dear. It is only right that we help speed the transition of those active duty servicemembers who have essentially put their lives on hold while they serve in the military full time. They need to have the same access to services and information. My legislation will expand this successful program to all active-duty servicemembers and their families. This will give these young men and women the ability and information to transition successfully to civilian life after protecting of our freedoms for so long. Once they leave the military and are the responsibility of the VA, it is too late. We need to speed the transition to civilian life and in the process, reduce suicide, and get these soon-to-be veterans in to the VA system for their health and claims benefits. Many of these men and women, when they leave the military, do not have the support structures they need to successfully reintegrate into civilian society. One young man I know of was homeless and could not have custody of his child and go to school on the [[Page E885]] GI Bill because he had stayed in the service on the first day of the month. He was ineligible for his housing stipend due to his service and was homeless. This is unacceptable and it is obvious that these men and women are being sent out into society unprepared for the decisions they must make: when to wake up, what clothes to buy, how to get housing. The Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program has been successful in what it was designed to do. We need to expand it to make sure all those who serve get the benefit of the lessons learned from this program. I am pleased to introduce this legislation to expand the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program to all servicemembers. With this, we can take the next step to ensuring that the young men and women who protect those of us here at home will have a home to return to. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E884-E885] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION EXPANDING THE YELLOW RIBBON PROGRAM ______ HON.

H. MORGAN GRIFFITH of virginia in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I submit these remarks to honor the life of Mr. Jackie Thomas Stump, who passed away on June 2, 2016. I had the pleasure of serving with Jackie, a coal miner-turned-legislator, in the Virginia House of Delegates, where he represented Buchanan, Tazewell, and Russell Counties. Jackie was born on January 13, 1948 in Lebanon, Virginia and served in the Air Force from 1967 to 1971, spending 18 months in Saigon as a jet mechanic. When he returned, he mined coal and in 1979 was elected secretary-treasurer of the United Mine Workers (UMW) District 28. In 1986, he was elected president of the UMW district, which covered most of Virginia. In 1989, during the Pittston Coal strike, Jackie ran and won a write- in campaign for the House of Delegates as an independent. He served until he resigned for health reasons in 2005. Jackie was one of a kind and, though he didn't often rise to speak on the floor, I will always remember that when he did, he usually shared the views of the ``little guy''--folks who many would say didn't have extraordinary wealth, power, or influence. Jackie also served on several boards and commissions, including the Virginia Parole Board and the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development. Jackie is survived by his wife of 25 years, Linda Stump, of Abingdon; his daughter, Ahbra Stump, of Abingdon; and his ``furry companion,'' Ruffles. He is also survived by his mother, Margret Stump, of Keen Mountain; his sisters, Wanda Sue Justice and husband Danny, Christine Hicks and husband David, all of Keen Mountain; and numerous nieces and nephews. I have always appreciated the good working relationship and friendship that Jackie and I had, and will continue fondly remembering how very deeply he cared about Southwest Virginia and those who call it home. I am saddened by Jackie's passing, and extend my prayers and deepest sympathies to his family and loved ones during this time. May God give them comfort and peace. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E885] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING JACKIE THOMAS STUMP ______ HON.

KEVIN BRADY of texas in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the outstanding efforts of the Pulmonary Hypertension Association (PHA) in the fight against the rare, debilitating disease, and potentially fatal condition, pulmonary hypertension (PH). I am proud to represent the Lone Star Chapter of PHA, located in The Woodlands. This disease was first brought to my attention over a decade ago by Chapter member, Jack Stibbs, whose daughter, Emily, had been recently diagnosed at an early age and given a dire prognosis. However, due to Emily's early diagnosis and advancements in medical research, including the development of innovative treatments, she has been able to lead a full life and even recently graduated college. Most patients are not as fortunate as Emily has been. PH can be idiopathic or occur as the result of sickle cell disease, scleroderma, and other conditions. Nearly 3 out of 4 PH patients are not diagnosed until the disease has reached a late stage, which renders many available therapies ineffective and leaves patients facing a much more serious medical intervention, such as heart-lung transplantation. PH is very aggressive and the average life expectancy without an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment is just under 3 years. I continually work with my colleagues in Congress to advance efforts that seek to lower healthcare costs, promote quality, and improve outcomes for patients. This is why I work with the PH community to call attention to important legislative efforts, including the Pulmonary Hypertension Research and Diagnosis Act (H.R. 3520), which seeks to leverage limited resources to ensure more PH patients are diagnosed at an early stage and can benefit from treatments like Emily has. This June, the PH community will be gathering in Texas for their Semi-Annual International Conference. This is a bittersweet engagement as it will be the last Conference for Rino Aldrighetti, who has served as President and CEO of PHA for 17 incredible years. After PHA was founded around a kitchen table by passionate advocates seeking to improve the lives of affected individuals and families, Rino was one of the first employees the organization hired. Under Rino's leadership the organization grew from modest beginnings to an agent for meaningful change. Today, PHA has expanded to an organization of more than fifty staff with a budget of $13 million. When Rino started most medical professionals knew little about the disease. There was one FDA approved therapy available, but far too frequently, patients died waiting for a diagnosis. But now, thanks to PHA, coordinated research and patient support efforts we have 14 FDA approved treatment options for PH, and PHA's Research Program has committed more than $17 million to support cutting edge research focused on PH. In addition, more than 80 independent PH associations have been established around the world, and PHA has signed Memorandum of Understanding with 35 nations. More can be done though. I ask my colleagues to recognize Rino and to honor his legacy of service to the PH community by supporting PH patients and early diagnosis legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E885] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE PULMONARY HYPERTENSION ASSOCIATION ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Palm Pavilion for its 90th year in business marked this past May 26, 2016. Started in 1926 by five partners, Palm Pavilion was intended to serve as a bathing pavilion for local patrons. One of the founders, Jesse Smith, recalls that it was open daily and was comprised of a bathhouse with changing rooms, a booth for towel and bathing suit rentals, a dance floor with jukebox music, a picnic area, and a kitchen. They served food like hamburgers and hot dogs while sodas and beer were kept cold in ice bins. For thirty eight years, Jesse Smith and his wife were the main owners of Palm Pavilion, but in the sixties, they sold it, Howard and Jean Hamilton. The Hamiltons worked to modernize by removing the bath house and focusing more on food and beverages, yet they made every effort to maintain the fun and relaxed atmosphere for which Palm Pavilion was known. Today, the Grill and Bar has expanded, providing seating for more than 300 beachgoers and serving all types of food. It also employs more than a hundred people. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Palm Pavilion for being a cornerstone of our community.

Mr. Speaker, last Sunday, David Gilkey, an NPR photojournalist from Portland, Oregon, was killed with his Afghani translator, Zabihullah Tamanna, in a Taliban ambush in Afghanistan. I cannot express fully my gratitude for David's tireless commitment to his profession. His evocative, powerful work, and many contributions to NPR will be remembered for generations. Graduating from Wilson High School in Portland in 1985, David followed the path of his father, Richard Gilkey, to Oregon State University, before following his passion of photojournalism at the Boulder Daily Camera, and then the Detroit Free Press before joining NPR in 2007. David covered conflict areas from around the globe, ethnic violence in Rwanda and the Balkans, apartheid in South Africa, famine in Somalia and violence in the Gaza Strip. Since 2001 he extensively covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was one of the most decorated of photojournalists, winning an Emmy in 2007 for a documentary video series and receiving 36 honors from the White House. In 2015, he was the first multimedia journalist to be awarded the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's prestigious Edward R. Murrow Award for Journalism. David and journalists like him play an essential role in helping us all better understand global events, putting themselves in harm's way to open the world's window for the rest of us.

GERALD E. CONNOLLY of virginia in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Richard Gabbert on his selection as a Mansfield Fellow. Mr. Gabbert is among ten federal government officials who will begin the year-long Mike Mansfield Fellowship Program in Japan this year. Congress established the Mansfield Fellowship Program in 1994 to build a corps of U.S. government officials with substantial Japan expertise. Since then one hundred and forty Fellows--representing twenty-seven U.S. government agencies, commissions and the U.S. Congress--have entered the Fellowship Program. Mr. Gabbert is a member of the twenty-first group of Mansfield Fellows, chosen through a selective recruitment and vetting process. Japan has long been an important part of Mr. Gabbert's life, and he is highly qualified for this unique professional development opportunity. He spent part of his childhood and early career in Japan, and continued this engagement during law school and in private practice. As a Senior Special Counsel at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mr. Gabbert helped develop a cross-border regulatory framework for the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets and the global financial institutions active in those markets. His Mansfield Fellowship will give him the contacts and understanding needed to facilitate U.S. Japan coordination in this area, coordination that is critical for a smooth transition to this new regulatory framework in our countries and globally Mr. Gabbert will begin his Fellowship in Japan this summer with a seven-week homestay and language training in Ishiltawa Prefecture. This will be followed by ten months of practical experience in Japanese government offices in Tokyo. During his placements he will work side- by-side with Japanese financial regulators. He will seek to understand the Japanese response to the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath, particularly the legislative and regulatory reforms designed to increase transparency and stability in the OTC derivatives markets. He also will explore current issues in the implementation of these reforms in Japan, including the challenges of cross-border regulation and supervision of these markets, in order to support effective domestic regulatory efforts. As a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and its Subcommittee on the Asia-Pacific, I understand the important role Japan plays in the global economy and the critical need to coordinate with Japan on financial and other matters. Close coordination requires U.S. government officials like Mr. Gabbert who are prepared to develop the contacts and expertise needed to facilitate their agencies' work on Japan-related programs. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Gabbert on his selection as a Mansfield Fellow. I am confident his Mansfield Fellowship experience will enhance the work of the SEC and deepen its cooperation with Japan. I hope you will also join me in recognizing the value of the Mike Mansfield Fellowship Program and the opportunities it provides U.S. government officials like Mr. Gabbert to learn about Japan and its government and to strengthen the U.S. relationship with this important ally. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 92 (Friday, June 10, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E886] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING RICHARD GABBERT ON HIS SELECTION AS A MANSFIELD FELLOW ______ HON.

DAVID W. JOLLY of florida in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize two men, Larry Williams and Jevon Graham, and congratulate them for being named Assistant Chiefs of Clearwater Fire and Rescue. Larry Williams and Jevon Graham were recently promoted to Assistant Fire Chiefs after achieving the top two scores among 43 applicants for the position. Mr. Williams and Mr. Graham, the first African American administrators in the history of the department, are making strides in their field and helping pave the way for future generations of the Clearwater Fire and Rescue teams. In the City of Clearwater, there are 196 Fire and Rescue employees and only 14 of them are African-American, comprising seven percent of the force. Mr. Williams and Mr. Graham's promotion to Assistant Fire Chiefs is a tremendous step forward for the Tampa Bay area and I applaud Mr. Williams and Mr. Graham for their efforts in our community. Mr. Williams' own heroes and mentors were firefighters who also broke racial barriers at [[Page E887]] the St. Petersburg Fire and Rescue station. He has served for 20 years with Clearwater Fire and Rescue. I thank him for the decades of service he has already given to us. Mr. Williams will be becoming the Assistant Chief of Suppression. Mr. Graham became a firefighter in 1998 and at the time was one of three minority firefighters in the department. He has worked for 17 years with Clearwater Fire and Rescue in various capacities including as a member of the dive team, technical rescue team, and as a lieutenant for 12 years.

DAVID W. JOLLY of florida in the house of representatives Friday, June 10, 2016 Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize two men, Larry Williams and Jevon Graham, and congratulate them for being named Assistant Chiefs of Clearwater Fire and Rescue. Larry Williams and Jevon Graham were recently promoted to Assistant Fire Chiefs after achieving the top two scores among 43 applicants for the position. Mr. Williams and Mr. Graham, the first African American administrators in the history of the department, are making strides in their field and helping pave the way for future generations of the Clearwater Fire and Rescue teams. In the City of Clearwater, there are 196 Fire and Rescue employees and only 14 of them are African-American, comprising seven percent of the force. Mr. Williams and Mr. Graham's promotion to Assistant Fire Chiefs is a tremendous step forward for the Tampa Bay area and I applaud Mr. Williams and Mr. Graham for their efforts in our community. Mr. Williams' own heroes and mentors were firefighters who also broke racial barriers at [[Page E887]] the St. Petersburg Fire and Rescue station. He has served for 20 years with Clearwater Fire and Rescue. I thank him for the decades of service he has already given to us. Mr. Williams will be becoming the Assistant Chief of Suppression. Mr. Graham became a firefighter in 1998 and at the time was one of three minority firefighters in the department. He has worked for 17 years with Clearwater Fire and Rescue in various capacities including as a member of the dive team, technical rescue team, and as a lieutenant for 12 years.

He was the youngest of twenty siblings where ten (10) were added by marriage. Mr. Tommy L. McCullough was raised in Valley View, Mississippi and attended Nichols School until the eighth grade. Later he went to Cameron Street High School and left to go to the Army while he was in the 12th grade. Mr. McCullough entered the Army on December 13, 1954, he was in the 25th Division at Scofield Barracks in Hawaii. While there an Honor Guard was formed after a few months and height requirements were 5 feet 10 inches tall, but because he was sharp and intelligent he was chosen to be a Guard, although he was 5 feet 8 inches tall. They later changed the title from Guard to Drill Platoon. No one could handle a rifle the way Mr. McCullough handled it and he was recognized with many letters of congratulations for his performance in the Drill Platoon, he also went to the Non-Commission Officer Academy and received a diploma. Within two years he went from a Private to SP3 (Specialist 3rd class). There he stayed until his discharge on November 27, 1956 and went back to Jackson, Mississippi. He had many friends who were Civil Rights Activist, one of them was a Freedom Rider, Mr. Jake Freeze, who was one of the leaders in the Freedom Riders Movement that lived in his house in 1963, which was later called the Freedom House in Madison County. Pictures are on the wall of the Civil Rights Museum in Canton, Mississippi, today. Mr. McCullough afterwards moved to Louisville, KY in 1965. He worked at Harshaws Chemical Company for about five years. He missed Mississippi so much that he came back and opened up a night club, Billa Farro, for five years in Jackson and later opened a Car Dealership, TC and III, and then he retired.

Later he went to Cameron Street High School and left to go to the Army while he was in the 12th grade. Mr. McCullough entered the Army on December 13, 1954, he was in the 25th Division at Scofield Barracks in Hawaii. While there an Honor Guard was formed after a few months and height requirements were 5 feet 10 inches tall, but because he was sharp and intelligent he was chosen to be a Guard, although he was 5 feet 8 inches tall. They later changed the title from Guard to Drill Platoon. No one could handle a rifle the way Mr. McCullough handled it and he was recognized with many letters of congratulations for his performance in the Drill Platoon, he also went to the Non-Commission Officer Academy and received a diploma. Within two years he went from a Private to SP3 (Specialist 3rd class). There he stayed until his discharge on November 27, 1956 and went back to Jackson, Mississippi. He had many friends who were Civil Rights Activist, one of them was a Freedom Rider, Mr. Jake Freeze, who was one of the leaders in the Freedom Riders Movement that lived in his house in 1963, which was later called the Freedom House in Madison County. Pictures are on the wall of the Civil Rights Museum in Canton, Mississippi, today. Mr. McCullough afterwards moved to Louisville, KY in 1965. He worked at Harshaws Chemical Company for about five years. He missed Mississippi so much that he came back and opened up a night club, Billa Farro, for five years in Jackson and later opened a Car Dealership, TC and III, and then he retired. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Tommy L McCullough for his dedication to serving others ____________________",package_114_182.csv,2421,2421,2487,"[congressional record volume 162, number 92 (friday, june 10, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e887] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring tommy l. mccullough ______ hon. bennie g. thompson of mississippi in the house of representatives friday, june 10, 2016 mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i rise today to honor a remarkable public servant, mr. tommy l. mccullough, who was born in pickens, madison county, mississippi to the late parents of w.e.l. and classie mccullough. he was the youngest of twenty siblings where ten (10) were added by marriage. mr. tommy l. mccullough was raised in valley view, mississippi and attended nichols school until the eighth grade. later he went to cameron street high school and left to go to the army while he was in the 12th grade. mr. mccullough entered the army on december 13, 1954, he was in the 25th division at scofield barracks in hawaii. while there an honor guard was formed after a few months and height requirements were 5 feet 10 inches tall, but because he was sharp and intelligent he was chosen to be a guard, although he was 5 feet 8 inches tall. they later changed the title from guard to drill platoon. no one could handle a rifle the way mr. mccullough handled it and he was recognized with many letters of congratulations for his performance in the drill platoon, he also went to the non-commission officer academy and received a diploma. within two years he went from a private to sp3 (specialist 3rd class). there he stayed until his discharge on november 27, 1956 and went back to jackson, mississippi. he had many friends who were civil rights activist, one of them was a freedom rider, mr. jake freeze, who was one of the leaders in the freedom riders movement that lived in his house in 1963, which was later called the freedom house in madison county. pictures are on the wall of the civil rights museum in canton, mississippi, today. mr. mccullough afterwards moved to louisville, ky in 1965. he worked at harshaws chemical company for about five years. he missed mississippi so much that he came back and opened up a night club, billa farro, for five years in jackson and later opened a car dealership, tc and iii, and then he retired. mr. speaker, i ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing mr. tommy l mccullough for his dedication to serving others ____________________",2421

Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize a member of our community, Rob Van Tassel, for being named Florida's Big Brother of the Year. Mr. Van Tassel is a logistics manager with Southwire, a manufacturing company based in Clearwater, Florida. He graduated from Dunedin High School in 1975 and has been a Pinellas County resident for many years now. Inspired by the way his father had raised him and encouraged by his own daughter, Mr. Van Tassel decided to join Big Brothers and Big Sisters and give back to the community that had given him and his family so much. In 2008, Mr. Van Tassel was matched with his current little brother Seth. For Seth, Rob is a supportive shoulder to lean on and a thoughtful advisor who keeps him focused on his education and making decisions that are beneficial for the rest of his life. Rob's work with Seth is truly exceptional. Rob believes that children need strong mentors for guidance, and that it is our responsibility to help guide children and young adults who need help finding their way. In addition to being named Florida's Big Brother of the Year, Mr. Van Tassel is also being considered for the national Big Brother of the Year award.

On June 10 each year, Dia de Portugal celebrates the Portuguese people, their strong heritage, and their beautiful country and culture. Dia de Portugal honors the death of the revered Portuguese poet Luis Vaz de Camoes in 1580. While his mastery of verse has been compared to both Shakespeare and Dante, Camoes is famously known for his epic ``Os Lusiadas,'' one of Portugal's most treasured literary works. The poem pays tribute to Portugal's golden age of exploration and celebrates the many world-changing discoveries made by its seafaring explorers in the 15th century. In his poem, Camoes speaks of the Portuguese as destined to accomplish great deeds, and they have. This rings especially true of the more than one million Portuguese-Americans who have been contributing to and enriching culture in the United States for generations. Americans of Portuguese descent are responsible for tremendous growth and innovation, whether it be in the arts, agriculture, sports, or the highest levels of American government. The unbreakable bond between Portugal and the United States goes back many years--to the very founding of our nation. After the Revolutionary War, Portugal was one of our first allies and one of the first countries to officially recognize the United States. In 1791, President George Washington formalized diplomatic relations with Portugal, and our relationship is stronger than ever more than 200 years later. Today, Portugal is not just our friend and ally, but an important strategic partner for the United States. We must never forget the role of Portugal and Lajes Field during World War II, when the Portuguese helped us protect supply ships, identify U-boats, and win the war against fascism. As home to the U.S. Air Force's 65th Air Base Wing, Lajes Field was instrumental in our efforts during the Cold War and the Yom Kippur War and continues to be a critical asset in the Atlantic. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I join hands with the people of Portugal to reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the many ties between us, and we vow to ensure our relationship remains strong and robust.

As home to the U.S. Air Force's 65th Air Base Wing, Lajes Field was instrumental in our efforts during the Cold War and the Yom Kippur War and continues to be a critical asset in the Atlantic. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I join hands with the people of Portugal to reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the many ties between us, and we vow to ensure our relationship remains strong and robust. Along with the people of Portugal and Portuguese-Americans throughout the United States, we wish everyone a happy and joyous Dia de Portugal. ____________________",package_114_182.csv,2891,2891,2957,"[congressional record volume 162, number 92 (friday, june 10, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e888] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] celebrating dia de portugal ______ hon. jim costa of california in the house of representatives friday, june 10, 2016 mr. costa. mr. speaker, i rise today with mr. nunes of california, mr. valadao of california, mr. cicilline of rhode island, mr. denham of california, mr. zeldin of new york, ms. lofgren of california, mr. mcgovern of massachusetts, and mr. honda of california to recognize dia de portugal. on june 10 each year, dia de portugal celebrates the portuguese people, their strong heritage, and their beautiful country and culture. dia de portugal honors the death of the revered portuguese poet luis vaz de camoes in 1580. while his mastery of verse has been compared to both shakespeare and dante, camoes is famously known for his epic ``os lusiadas,'' one of portugal's most treasured literary works. the poem pays tribute to portugal's golden age of exploration and celebrates the many world-changing discoveries made by its seafaring explorers in the 15th century. in his poem, camoes speaks of the portuguese as destined to accomplish great deeds, and they have. this rings especially true of the more than one million portuguese-americans who have been contributing to and enriching culture in the united states for generations. americans of portuguese descent are responsible for tremendous growth and innovation, whether it be in the arts, agriculture, sports, or the highest levels of american government. the unbreakable bond between portugal and the united states goes back many years--to the very founding of our nation. after the revolutionary war, portugal was one of our first allies and one of the first countries to officially recognize the united states. in 1791, president george washington formalized diplomatic relations with portugal, and our relationship is stronger than ever more than 200 years later. today, portugal is not just our friend and ally, but an important strategic partner for the united states. we must never forget the role of portugal and lajes field during world war ii, when the portuguese helped us protect supply ships, identify u-boats, and win the war against fascism. as home to the u.s. air force's 65th air base wing, lajes field was instrumental in our efforts during the cold war and the yom kippur war and continues to be a critical asset in the atlantic. mr. speaker, my colleagues and i join hands with the people of portugal to reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the many ties between us, and we vow to ensure our relationship remains strong and robust. along with the people of portugal and portuguese-americans throughout the united states, we wish everyone a happy and joyous dia de portugal. ____________________",2891
