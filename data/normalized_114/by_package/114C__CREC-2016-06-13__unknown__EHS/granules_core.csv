The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. General Leave Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 337, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. We stand here today 3 weeks shy of the FOIA's 50th anniversary to strengthen the law that established the public's right to know. Enacted in 1966, FOIA was the product of more than a decade of work on government secrecy by a predecessor committee to the current Oversight and Government Reform Committee. At the time, FOIA was only the third public information law in the world. It was by far the most far-reaching. FOIA established a right to information, which is commonly known as the public's right to know. S. 337 reaffirms the public's right to know and puts in place several reforms to stop agencies from slowly eroding the effectiveness of using FOIA to exercise that right. This bill is a bipartisan effort to improve the public's access to information and transparency in the Federal Government. I would like to thank Senators Cornyn, Grassley, and Leahy for their [[Page H3717]] hard work that they put into writing and passing this bill. I would also like to thank Representative Darrell Issa and Ranking Member Elijah Cummings for their work on the House bill, H.R. 653, which passed in January. Through all of our combined efforts, I believe that this is the best bill we can send to the President's desk. I have no doubt that the reforms contained in this bill will significantly improve the American public's ability to exercise their right to access information. The most important reform is the presumption of openness. Now, while some--but far from all--Federal agencies have made an effort to comply with the letter of the law, very few have complied with the spirit of the law. The presumption of openness puts that spirit into the letter of the law. Before claiming an exemption, agencies must first determine whether they could reasonably foresee an actual harm. FOIA includes exemptions because publicly releasing information can sometimes cause more harm than good. But from the beginning, agencies have taken advantage of these exemptions to withhold any information that might technically fit. Under the presumption of openness, agencies may no longer withhold information that is embarrassing or could possibly paint the agency in a negative light simply because an exemption may technically apply. This will go a long way toward getting rid of the withhold-it-because-you-want-to exemption. S. 337 establishes reforms that will bring attention, leadership, and commitment to improvement to all Federal agencies. The Department of Homeland Security is a great example of how attention, leadership, and a commitment to improvement can be more valuable, at times, than additional dollars. From 2009 to 2015, requests sent to DHS nearly tripled. DHS requests accounted for about 40 percent of all the requests governmentwide. As the requests increased, so did the backlog. And in 2014, that backlog at DHS exceeded more than 100,000 requests. However, the agency made a commitment to improve its efficiency and reduce its backlog. In 2015, that backlog was down by two-thirds, to about 35,000. Costs overall went up, but that is expected when requests nearly triple in just 6 years. What is not expected is that the cost per request was cut by 58 percent. In 2009, DHS averaged $255 per request processed, and in 2015, the costs had dropped to $148 per request processed. S. 337 establishes reforms that will ensure all agencies have the attention and the leadership necessary to improve the FOIA process. The bill establishes a Chief FOIA Officers Council, which is directed to develop initiatives to increase transparency and compliance with FOIA and make recommendations for increased efficiencies and share best practices. The bill establishes greater independence of the Office of Government Information Services, which will allow OGIS to give unbiased, unfiltered testimony and recommendations. S. 337 creates an incentive for agencies to comply with the law by preventing agencies from collecting fees for any request for up to 5,000 pages if that request is not completed within the statutory time limits. Out-of-date regulations have been repeatedly used as an excuse to withhold information, delay requests, or otherwise to obstruct the process. S. 337 gets rid of this excuse by requiring agencies to update their regulations so that they are operating under the current law. S. 337 also simplifies the process of submitting requests by establishing an online central portal that will allow a member of the public to submit a request to an agency at a single Web site rather than forcing the public to navigate each agency's different process and Web site. These reforms and others packaged in the FOIA Improvement Act will go a long way to improving transparency and bringing agency leadership attention to improving the public's ability to exercise their right to know. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this giant step forward to improve FOIA and the public's access to information. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1700 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, also known as the public's right to know or Transparency in Government Act. It is fitting that we pass this bill to strengthen the Freedom of Information Act just a few weeks before the 50th anniversary of this important law. The National Archives and Records Administration currently has on display the original Freedom of Information Act in celebration of the anniversary on July 4. It is inspiring to think that 50 years have passed and that document is still the most important tool that the public has to access information about their government. When FOIA was passed in 1966, it was only the third freedom of information law in the entire world, and it was by far the most powerful. Now countries all over the world have transparency laws that are modeled on our Nation's FOIA law. We are here today in the ongoing quest to improve FOIA and to keep it current with changes in technology. I want to thank Congressmen Issa and Cummings for introducing the House version of the bill and Senators Leahy and Cornyn for taking the lead in the Senate. This bill is the result of many voices providing feedback and helpful critiques. That is the way a good law is made. Advocacy groups such as OpenTheGovernment.org and the Sunshine in Government Initiative have been critical to the success of this legislation. The FOIA Improvement Act is a bicameral, bipartisan bill. With its passage today, it will now go on to the President for his signature. The bill would codify the presumption of openness standard that President Obama put in place on his first day in office. Under this standard, agencies will be required to err on the side of transparency when responding to requests. The bill would also put a 25-year sunset on exemption 5 of FOIA, the deliberative process exemption. It would modernize FOIA by requiring the Office of Management and Budget to create a central FOIA Web site for requesters to submit their request, making it more efficient and accessible to the public. This bill would strengthen the independence and the role of the Office of Government Information Services. OGIS has served a critical role since it was formed in response to the last FOIA reform Congress adopted in 2007. I would like to take a moment to thank the hardworking Federal employees who serve as FOIA officers. They are dedicated professionals who care about making FOIA work. It is critical that Congress provide the funds necessary for agencies to have strong FOIA programs with experienced and trained FOIA professionals. It is not reasonable for us to ask agencies to do more if we do not give them the resources to do it. The FOIA Improvement Act would require each agency to designate a chief FOIA officer. The chief FOIA officer would have responsibility for ensuring that FOIA is implemented efficiently and appropriately in the agency. I hope this addition to FOIA will help elevate the importance of FOIA in agencies that have not always given it the attention it deserves. Thank you to the many FOIA professionals who have provided feedback on the bill over the past 3 years. Thank you also to the FOIA requesters who provided feedback, requesters such as Nate Jones from the National Security Archive and David McCraw from The New York Times. They all provided useful suggestions for reform. I understand that some proposals did not make it into the final bill, but they did shape the debate and will help us as we look forward to future reforms. A Los Angeles Times editorial said: ``worthy of not only Obama's signature, but also his vocal support.'' A New York Times editorial said: ``This is a rare chance to log a significant bipartisan accomplishment in the public interest.'' Enactment of this legislation will be an important step forward for transparency. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from [[Page H3718]] New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) for her support on this bill. I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa), who has spent a considerable amount of time not only on the House version, but really helping shape the debate on making sure that the public interests of America is protected. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, this has been a long time coming, and there is a lot of thanks to go around. Certainly for Senator Cornyn and Senator Leahy, this is going to be a proud week with the passage of this bill in the House and, ultimately, it going to the President. I don't believe this would have been possible without the partnership that Elijah Cummings and I formed some years ago. The House has led in not just one, but in two Congresses, sending to the Senate very tough language dramatically improving what we see as the flaws in FOIA that have developed. Congresswoman Maloney, very rightfully so, said there are a lot of things that the interest groups and Congressman Cummings and myself and, perhaps, everyone else who will vote on it here today would like to have seen. I don't want to belabor the point, but when this bill becomes law and is signed by the President, there will be enough left for a new bill to start again. Having said that, we celebrate today the fact that we have made some milestones. Codifying in law the presumption of openness and, once and for all, ending the deliberative process' unlimited length and reducing it to 25 years long, long after a President has left office, is a good start. I want to note that, in the original House bill--one area that I was particularly pleased that Mr. Cummings and I were able to come to an agreement on--if an agency unreasonably delays, there should be a result. If someone has to sue, whether it is The New York Times or an interest group, and, ultimately, the government is unreasonable and is withholding, reasonable fees should be recovered. That isn't in the bill. I hope that it will be in future legislation. The fact is that this bill includes some very important points, not the least of which will be making more public and accessible the repeated request for various parts of FOIA, and, of course, reducing the delays and the time lag. Having said that, through the establishment of a board and the recognition that only through diligence and closing the quality circle that occurs can we come back to this body and say more needs to be done and name it. But today is a day for celebration. I want to thank Mr. Cummings one more time, Chairman Chaffetz, the Members of the House and the Senate, urge the passage of the bill, and recognize that this is, in fact, a 50-year-old law. It has stood the test of time. It has proven to be an asset for the American people and for their right to know. We will build on this. Lastly, and Congresswoman Maloney named it, there were countless outside transparency groups that spanned from the farthest left of our country's politics to the farthest right of our politics, all of whom wanted more open access to their government. Today, we are achieving it. We still will have a government that knows far more about us than we know about our government; but today, we are opening the possibility that, in a timely fashion, more often more people who have a vested interest in knowing something that the government has done or is doing will have the ability to get that information. I thank Congressman Meadows for making this bill possible today. His leadership has been critical, and his friendship has been critical all along the way. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), who has led many of the discussions in this body on criminal justice reform and reform in so many ways, including this bill that he helped author with former Chairman Issa. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I want to thank Mr. Meadows and Mr. Chaffetz and, certainly, Speaker Ryan for getting this bill to the floor. I associate myself completely with the words of the former chairman of our Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. Issa. I don't think there has been anyone who has worked harder on getting this bill to the floor than Mr. Issa. Without a doubt, his fingerprints are all over it. I really do, from the depths of my heart, thank him for all that he has done to make this happen. The FOIA Improvement Act is a product of a 3-year journey--that is a long time--that began when Representative Issa and I first introduced the basis for the bill in 2013. Mr. Issa worked with me on the House version of this bill, and Senators Leahy and Cornyn took the lead in the Senate. Again, I want to thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, for his work on FOIA reform and for his support bringing the bill to the floor. He has proposed some additional initiatives that did not make it into this version of the bill but that deserve continued attention. Even in our negotiations, I give it to Chairman Chaffetz. You know, a lot of times when you are trying to work things out and get things done between the House and the Senate, there has to be some compromise. There are a lot of good things that he wanted in the bill that I strongly supported, but we were not able to get them in. For example, one of his provisions would have required every agency to accept FOIA requests by email. This is a simple improvement that every agency should adopt, and I look forward to working with Chairman Chaffetz in the years ahead on such commonsense reforms. I would like to recognize a few of the staff for both Representatives Issa and Chaffetz who deserve recognition, strong recognition, for the work they put into this legislation over the last few years: Tegan Gelfand, Ali Ahmad, and Katy Rother. I want to thank them for all of the work that they have done in making this happen. In addition, advocacy groups, as Mr. Issa mentioned, such as OpenTheGovernment.org and Sunshine in Government Initiative, as well as experts such as Anne Weismann at Campaign for Accountability, have been critical to the success of this legislation. Finally, I would like to take time to thank our Speaker. His office has been extremely helpful, and he also deserves credit for bringing this bill to the floor today. It simply would not have been possible without his leadership. The FOIA Improvement Act is a truly bicameral, bipartisan bill. With its passage today, it will now go on to the President for his signature. It builds on the work of the Obama administration, which has done more to advance transparency than any administration in history. {time} 1715 The bill would codify the presumption of openness standard that President Obama put in place on his first day in office. The bill would also put a 25-year sunset on exemption No. 5 of FOIA-- the deliberative process exemption. It would modernize FOIA by requiring the Office of Management and Budget to create a central portal to allow FOIA requests to any agency through a single Web site. The Office of Government Information Services, which is the FOIA ombudsman that was created by Congress in 2007, would become more independent under this bill and would be allowed to submit testimony and reports directly to Congress without going through political review. Finally, FOIA officers could share best practices through a Chief FOIA Officers Council that would be established under the bill. These are just some of the examples of the many improvements to FOIA that are contained in this legislation. The FOIA Improvement Act is a big step forward in transparency, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ``fix FOIA by 50.'' Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) for his insightful, well-thought-out words on behalf of this bill. Indeed, Mr. Issa and Mr. Cummings have been a moving force and, really, one of the primary forces as to why we are here today; so I just want to acknowledge that. [[Page H3719]] I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I join my voice with Ranking Member Cummings' in being associated with the words from my friend and colleague from the great State of North Carolina in support of this important legislation and to also compliment not only Elijah Cummings for his leadership, but former Chairman Issa for making this a priority and for helping to move it to the floor and make it happen. This is a good, bipartisan bill. It was worked on diligently by both sides in both the House and the Senate. It is an important step forward for transparency. It is a strengthened bill. It deserves the support of everyone on both sides of the aisle, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I acknowledge the, really, unbelievable work of the staff. Many times, as you well know, Mr. Speaker, we will get up and work very hard, but it is the countless hours on behalf of our staff that really allows us to move legislation forward; so I wouldn't want this day to go by without acknowledging their support and work. Also, I acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Chaffetz in his being able to not only navigate this bill before and, hopefully, to the President's desk for signing, but certainly in his leadership on transparency and in making sure that the government of the people is accountable to the people. I urge the adoption of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rigell). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 337. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3714-H3719] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2016 Mr. MEADOWS.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. General Leave Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 337, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. We stand here today 3 weeks shy of the FOIA's 50th anniversary to strengthen the law that established the public's right to know. Enacted in 1966, FOIA was the product of more than a decade of work on government secrecy by a predecessor committee to the current Oversight and Government Reform Committee. At the time, FOIA was only the third public information law in the world. It was by far the most far-reaching. FOIA established a right to information, which is commonly known as the public's right to know. S. 337 reaffirms the public's right to know and puts in place several reforms to stop agencies from slowly eroding the effectiveness of using FOIA to exercise that right. This bill is a bipartisan effort to improve the public's access to information and transparency in the Federal Government. I would like to thank Senators Cornyn, Grassley, and Leahy for their [[Page H3717]] hard work that they put into writing and passing this bill. I would also like to thank Representative Darrell Issa and Ranking Member Elijah Cummings for their work on the House bill, H.R. 653, which passed in January. Through all of our combined efforts, I believe that this is the best bill we can send to the President's desk. I have no doubt that the reforms contained in this bill will significantly improve the American public's ability to exercise their right to access information. The most important reform is the presumption of openness. Now, while some--but far from all--Federal agencies have made an effort to comply with the letter of the law, very few have complied with the spirit of the law. The presumption of openness puts that spirit into the letter of the law. Before claiming an exemption, agencies must first determine whether they could reasonably foresee an actual harm. FOIA includes exemptions because publicly releasing information can sometimes cause more harm than good. But from the beginning, agencies have taken advantage of these exemptions to withhold any information that might technically fit. Under the presumption of openness, agencies may no longer withhold information that is embarrassing or could possibly paint the agency in a negative light simply because an exemption may technically apply. This will go a long way toward getting rid of the withhold-it-because-you-want-to exemption. S. 337 establishes reforms that will bring attention, leadership, and commitment to improvement to all Federal agencies. The Department of Homeland Security is a great example of how attention, leadership, and a commitment to improvement can be more valuable, at times, than additional dollars. From 2009 to 2015, requests sent to DHS nearly tripled. DHS requests accounted for about 40 percent of all the requests governmentwide. As the requests increased, so did the backlog. And in 2014, that backlog at DHS exceeded more than 100,000 requests. However, the agency made a commitment to improve its efficiency and reduce its backlog. In 2015, that backlog was down by two-thirds, to about 35,000. Costs overall went up, but that is expected when requests nearly triple in just 6 years. What is not expected is that the cost per request was cut by 58 percent. In 2009, DHS averaged $255 per request processed, and in 2015, the costs had dropped to $148 per request processed. S. 337 establishes reforms that will ensure all agencies have the attention and the leadership necessary to improve the FOIA process. The bill establishes a Chief FOIA Officers Council, which is directed to develop initiatives to increase transparency and compliance with FOIA and make recommendations for increased efficiencies and share best practices. The bill establishes greater independence of the Office of Government Information Services, which will allow OGIS to give unbiased, unfiltered testimony and recommendations. S. 337 creates an incentive for agencies to comply with the law by preventing agencies from collecting fees for any request for up to 5,000 pages if that request is not completed within the statutory time limits. Out-of-date regulations have been repeatedly used as an excuse to withhold information, delay requests, or otherwise to obstruct the process. S. 337 gets rid of this excuse by requiring agencies to update their regulations so that they are operating under the current law. S. 337 also simplifies the process of submitting requests by establishing an online central portal that will allow a member of the public to submit a request to an agency at a single Web site rather than forcing the public to navigate each agency's different process and Web site. These reforms and others packaged in the FOIA Improvement Act will go a long way to improving transparency and bringing agency leadership attention to improving the public's ability to exercise their right to know. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this giant step forward to improve FOIA and the public's access to information. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1700 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, also known as the public's right to know or Transparency in Government Act. It is fitting that we pass this bill to strengthen the Freedom of Information Act just a few weeks before the 50th anniversary of this important law. The National Archives and Records Administration currently has on display the original Freedom of Information Act in celebration of the anniversary on July 4. It is inspiring to think that 50 years have passed and that document is still the most important tool that the public has to access information about their government. When FOIA was passed in 1966, it was only the third freedom of information law in the entire world, and it was by far the most powerful. Now countries all over the world have transparency laws that are modeled on our Nation's FOIA law. We are here today in the ongoing quest to improve FOIA and to keep it current with changes in technology. I want to thank Congressmen Issa and Cummings for introducing the House version of the bill and Senators Leahy and Cornyn for taking the lead in the Senate. This bill is the result of many voices providing feedback and helpful critiques. That is the way a good law is made. Advocacy groups such as OpenTheGovernment.org and the Sunshine in Government Initiative have been critical to the success of this legislation. The FOIA Improvement Act is a bicameral, bipartisan bill. With its passage today, it will now go on to the President for his signature. The bill would codify the presumption of openness standard that President Obama put in place on his first day in office. Under this standard, agencies will be required to err on the side of transparency when responding to requests. The bill would also put a 25-year sunset on exemption 5 of FOIA, the deliberative process exemption. It would modernize FOIA by requiring the Office of Management and Budget to create a central FOIA Web site for requesters to submit their request, making it more efficient and accessible to the public. This bill would strengthen the independence and the role of the Office of Government Information Services. OGIS has served a critical role since it was formed in response to the last FOIA reform Congress adopted in 2007. I would like to take a moment to thank the hardworking Federal employees who serve as FOIA officers. They are dedicated professionals who care about making FOIA work. It is critical that Congress provide the funds necessary for agencies to have strong FOIA programs with experienced and trained FOIA professionals. It is not reasonable for us to ask agencies to do more if we do not give them the resources to do it. The FOIA Improvement Act would require each agency to designate a chief FOIA officer. The chief FOIA officer would have responsibility for ensuring that FOIA is implemented efficiently and appropriately in the agency. I hope this addition to FOIA will help elevate the importance of FOIA in agencies that have not always given it the attention it deserves. Thank you to the many FOIA professionals who have provided feedback on the bill over the past 3 years. Thank you also to the FOIA requesters who provided feedback, requesters such as Nate Jones from the National Security Archive and David McCraw from The New York Times. They all provided useful suggestions for reform. I understand that some proposals did not make it into the final bill, but they did shape the debate and will help us as we look forward to future reforms. A Los Angeles Times editorial said: ``worthy of not only Obama's signature, but also his vocal support.'' A New York Times editorial said: ``This is a rare chance to log a significant bipartisan accomplishment in the public interest.'' Enactment of this legislation will be an important step forward for transparency. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from [[Page H3718]] New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) for her support on this bill. I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa), who has spent a considerable amount of time not only on the House version, but really helping shape the debate on making sure that the public interests of America is protected. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, this has been a long time coming, and there is a lot of thanks to go around. Certainly for Senator Cornyn and Senator Leahy, this is going to be a proud week with the passage of this bill in the House and, ultimately, it going to the President. I don't believe this would have been possible without the partnership that Elijah Cummings and I formed some years ago. The House has led in not just one, but in two Congresses, sending to the Senate very tough language dramatically improving what we see as the flaws in FOIA that have developed. Congresswoman Maloney, very rightfully so, said there are a lot of things that the interest groups and Congressman Cummings and myself and, perhaps, everyone else who will vote on it here today would like to have seen. I don't want to belabor the point, but when this bill becomes law and is signed by the President, there will be enough left for a new bill to start again. Having said that, we celebrate today the fact that we have made some milestones. Codifying in law the presumption of openness and, once and for all, ending the deliberative process' unlimited length and reducing it to 25 years long, long after a President has left office, is a good start. I want to note that, in the original House bill--one area that I was particularly pleased that Mr. Cummings and I were able to come to an agreement on--if an agency unreasonably delays, there should be a result. If someone has to sue, whether it is The New York Times or an interest group, and, ultimately, the government is unreasonable and is withholding, reasonable fees should be recovered. That isn't in the bill. I hope that it will be in future legislation. The fact is that this bill includes some very important points, not the least of which will be making more public and accessible the repeated request for various parts of FOIA, and, of course, reducing the delays and the time lag. Having said that, through the establishment of a board and the recognition that only through diligence and closing the quality circle that occurs can we come back to this body and say more needs to be done and name it. But today is a day for celebration. I want to thank Mr. Cummings one more time, Chairman Chaffetz, the Members of the House and the Senate, urge the passage of the bill, and recognize that this is, in fact, a 50-year-old law. It has stood the test of time. It has proven to be an asset for the American people and for their right to know. We will build on this. Lastly, and Congresswoman Maloney named it, there were countless outside transparency groups that spanned from the farthest left of our country's politics to the farthest right of our politics, all of whom wanted more open access to their government. Today, we are achieving it. We still will have a government that knows far more about us than we know about our government; but today, we are opening the possibility that, in a timely fashion, more often more people who have a vested interest in knowing something that the government has done or is doing will have the ability to get that information. I thank Congressman Meadows for making this bill possible today. His leadership has been critical, and his friendship has been critical all along the way. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), who has led many of the discussions in this body on criminal justice reform and reform in so many ways, including this bill that he helped author with former Chairman Issa. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I want to thank Mr. Meadows and Mr. Chaffetz and, certainly, Speaker Ryan for getting this bill to the floor. I associate myself completely with the words of the former chairman of our Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. Issa. I don't think there has been anyone who has worked harder on getting this bill to the floor than Mr. Issa. Without a doubt, his fingerprints are all over it. I really do, from the depths of my heart, thank him for all that he has done to make this happen. The FOIA Improvement Act is a product of a 3-year journey--that is a long time--that began when Representative Issa and I first introduced the basis for the bill in 2013. Mr. Issa worked with me on the House version of this bill, and Senators Leahy and Cornyn took the lead in the Senate. Again, I want to thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, for his work on FOIA reform and for his support bringing the bill to the floor. He has proposed some additional initiatives that did not make it into this version of the bill but that deserve continued attention. Even in our negotiations, I give it to Chairman Chaffetz. You know, a lot of times when you are trying to work things out and get things done between the House and the Senate, there has to be some compromise. There are a lot of good things that he wanted in the bill that I strongly supported, but we were not able to get them in. For example, one of his provisions would have required every agency to accept FOIA requests by email. This is a simple improvement that every agency should adopt, and I look forward to working with Chairman Chaffetz in the years ahead on such commonsense reforms. I would like to recognize a few of the staff for both Representatives Issa and Chaffetz who deserve recognition, strong recognition, for the work they put into this legislation over the last few years: Tegan Gelfand, Ali Ahmad, and Katy Rother. I want to thank them for all of the work that they have done in making this happen. In addition, advocacy groups, as Mr. Issa mentioned, such as OpenTheGovernment.org and Sunshine in Government Initiative, as well as experts such as Anne Weismann at Campaign for Accountability, have been critical to the success of this legislation. Finally, I would like to take time to thank our Speaker. His office has been extremely helpful, and he also deserves credit for bringing this bill to the floor today. It simply would not have been possible without his leadership. The FOIA Improvement Act is a truly bicameral, bipartisan bill. With its passage today, it will now go on to the President for his signature. It builds on the work of the Obama administration, which has done more to advance transparency than any administration in history. {time} 1715 The bill would codify the presumption of openness standard that President Obama put in place on his first day in office. The bill would also put a 25-year sunset on exemption No. 5 of FOIA-- the deliberative process exemption. It would modernize FOIA by requiring the Office of Management and Budget to create a central portal to allow FOIA requests to any agency through a single Web site. The Office of Government Information Services, which is the FOIA ombudsman that was created by Congress in 2007, would become more independent under this bill and would be allowed to submit testimony and reports directly to Congress without going through political review. Finally, FOIA officers could share best practices through a Chief FOIA Officers Council that would be established under the bill. These are just some of the examples of the many improvements to FOIA that are contained in this legislation. The FOIA Improvement Act is a big step forward in transparency, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ``fix FOIA by 50.'' Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) for his insightful, well-thought-out words on behalf of this bill. Indeed, Mr. Issa and Mr. Cummings have been a moving force and, really, one of the primary forces as to why we are here today; so I just want to acknowledge that. [[Page H3719]] I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I join my voice with Ranking Member Cummings' in being associated with the words from my friend and colleague from the great State of North Carolina in support of this important legislation and to also compliment not only Elijah Cummings for his leadership, but former Chairman Issa for making this a priority and for helping to move it to the floor and make it happen. This is a good, bipartisan bill. It was worked on diligently by both sides in both the House and the Senate. It is an important step forward for transparency. It is a strengthened bill. It deserves the support of everyone on both sides of the aisle, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I acknowledge the, really, unbelievable work of the staff. Many times, as you well know, Mr. Speaker, we will get up and work very hard, but it is the countless hours on behalf of our staff that really allows us to move legislation forward; so I wouldn't want this day to go by without acknowledging their support and work. Also, I acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Chaffetz in his being able to not only navigate this bill before and, hopefully, to the President's desk for signing, but certainly in his leadership on transparency and in making sure that the government of the people is accountable to the people. I urge the adoption of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rigell). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 337. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3714-H3719] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2016 Mr. MEADOWS.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. General Leave Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 337, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. We stand here today 3 weeks shy of the FOIA's 50th anniversary to strengthen the law that established the public's right to know. Enacted in 1966, FOIA was the product of more than a decade of work on government secrecy by a predecessor committee to the current Oversight and Government Reform Committee. At the time, FOIA was only the third public information law in the world. It was by far the most far-reaching. FOIA established a right to information, which is commonly known as the public's right to know. S. 337 reaffirms the public's right to know and puts in place several reforms to stop agencies from slowly eroding the effectiveness of using FOIA to exercise that right. This bill is a bipartisan effort to improve the public's access to information and transparency in the Federal Government. I would like to thank Senators Cornyn, Grassley, and Leahy for their [[Page H3717]] hard work that they put into writing and passing this bill. I would also like to thank Representative Darrell Issa and Ranking Member Elijah Cummings for their work on the House bill, H.R. 653, which passed in January. Through all of our combined efforts, I believe that this is the best bill we can send to the President's desk. I have no doubt that the reforms contained in this bill will significantly improve the American public's ability to exercise their right to access information. The most important reform is the presumption of openness. Now, while some--but far from all--Federal agencies have made an effort to comply with the letter of the law, very few have complied with the spirit of the law. The presumption of openness puts that spirit into the letter of the law. Before claiming an exemption, agencies must first determine whether they could reasonably foresee an actual harm. FOIA includes exemptions because publicly releasing information can sometimes cause more harm than good. But from the beginning, agencies have taken advantage of these exemptions to withhold any information that might technically fit. Under the presumption of openness, agencies may no longer withhold information that is embarrassing or could possibly paint the agency in a negative light simply because an exemption may technically apply. This will go a long way toward getting rid of the withhold-it-because-you-want-to exemption. S. 337 establishes reforms that will bring attention, leadership, and commitment to improvement to all Federal agencies. The Department of Homeland Security is a great example of how attention, leadership, and a commitment to improvement can be more valuable, at times, than additional dollars. From 2009 to 2015, requests sent to DHS nearly tripled. DHS requests accounted for about 40 percent of all the requests governmentwide. As the requests increased, so did the backlog. And in 2014, that backlog at DHS exceeded more than 100,000 requests. However, the agency made a commitment to improve its efficiency and reduce its backlog. In 2015, that backlog was down by two-thirds, to about 35,000. Costs overall went up, but that is expected when requests nearly triple in just 6 years. What is not expected is that the cost per request was cut by 58 percent. In 2009, DHS averaged $255 per request processed, and in 2015, the costs had dropped to $148 per request processed. S. 337 establishes reforms that will ensure all agencies have the attention and the leadership necessary to improve the FOIA process. The bill establishes a Chief FOIA Officers Council, which is directed to develop initiatives to increase transparency and compliance with FOIA and make recommendations for increased efficiencies and share best practices. The bill establishes greater independence of the Office of Government Information Services, which will allow OGIS to give unbiased, unfiltered testimony and recommendations. S. 337 creates an incentive for agencies to comply with the law by preventing agencies from collecting fees for any request for up to 5,000 pages if that request is not completed within the statutory time limits. Out-of-date regulations have been repeatedly used as an excuse to withhold information, delay requests, or otherwise to obstruct the process. S. 337 gets rid of this excuse by requiring agencies to update their regulations so that they are operating under the current law. S. 337 also simplifies the process of submitting requests by establishing an online central portal that will allow a member of the public to submit a request to an agency at a single Web site rather than forcing the public to navigate each agency's different process and Web site. These reforms and others packaged in the FOIA Improvement Act will go a long way to improving transparency and bringing agency leadership attention to improving the public's ability to exercise their right to know. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this giant step forward to improve FOIA and the public's access to information. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1700 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, also known as the public's right to know or Transparency in Government Act. It is fitting that we pass this bill to strengthen the Freedom of Information Act just a few weeks before the 50th anniversary of this important law. The National Archives and Records Administration currently has on display the original Freedom of Information Act in celebration of the anniversary on July 4. It is inspiring to think that 50 years have passed and that document is still the most important tool that the public has to access information about their government. When FOIA was passed in 1966, it was only the third freedom of information law in the entire world, and it was by far the most powerful. Now countries all over the world have transparency laws that are modeled on our Nation's FOIA law. We are here today in the ongoing quest to improve FOIA and to keep it current with changes in technology. I want to thank Congressmen Issa and Cummings for introducing the House version of the bill and Senators Leahy and Cornyn for taking the lead in the Senate. This bill is the result of many voices providing feedback and helpful critiques. That is the way a good law is made. Advocacy groups such as OpenTheGovernment.org and the Sunshine in Government Initiative have been critical to the success of this legislation. The FOIA Improvement Act is a bicameral, bipartisan bill. With its passage today, it will now go on to the President for his signature. The bill would codify the presumption of openness standard that President Obama put in place on his first day in office. Under this standard, agencies will be required to err on the side of transparency when responding to requests. The bill would also put a 25-year sunset on exemption 5 of FOIA, the deliberative process exemption. It would modernize FOIA by requiring the Office of Management and Budget to create a central FOIA Web site for requesters to submit their request, making it more efficient and accessible to the public. This bill would strengthen the independence and the role of the Office of Government Information Services. OGIS has served a critical role since it was formed in response to the last FOIA reform Congress adopted in 2007. I would like to take a moment to thank the hardworking Federal employees who serve as FOIA officers. They are dedicated professionals who care about making FOIA work. It is critical that Congress provide the funds necessary for agencies to have strong FOIA programs with experienced and trained FOIA professionals. It is not reasonable for us to ask agencies to do more if we do not give them the resources to do it. The FOIA Improvement Act would require each agency to designate a chief FOIA officer. The chief FOIA officer would have responsibility for ensuring that FOIA is implemented efficiently and appropriately in the agency. I hope this addition to FOIA will help elevate the importance of FOIA in agencies that have not always given it the attention it deserves. Thank you to the many FOIA professionals who have provided feedback on the bill over the past 3 years. Thank you also to the FOIA requesters who provided feedback, requesters such as Nate Jones from the National Security Archive and David McCraw from The New York Times. They all provided useful suggestions for reform. I understand that some proposals did not make it into the final bill, but they did shape the debate and will help us as we look forward to future reforms. A Los Angeles Times editorial said: ``worthy of not only Obama's signature, but also his vocal support.'' A New York Times editorial said: ``This is a rare chance to log a significant bipartisan accomplishment in the public interest.'' Enactment of this legislation will be an important step forward for transparency. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from [[Page H3718]] New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) for her support on this bill. I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa), who has spent a considerable amount of time not only on the House version, but really helping shape the debate on making sure that the public interests of America is protected. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, this has been a long time coming, and there is a lot of thanks to go around. Certainly for Senator Cornyn and Senator Leahy, this is going to be a proud week with the passage of this bill in the House and, ultimately, it going to the President. I don't believe this would have been possible without the partnership that Elijah Cummings and I formed some years ago. The House has led in not just one, but in two Congresses, sending to the Senate very tough language dramatically improving what we see as the flaws in FOIA that have developed. Congresswoman Maloney, very rightfully so, said there are a lot of things that the interest groups and Congressman Cummings and myself and, perhaps, everyone else who will vote on it here today would like to have seen. I don't want to belabor the point, but when this bill becomes law and is signed by the President, there will be enough left for a new bill to start again. Having said that, we celebrate today the fact that we have made some milestones. Codifying in law the presumption of openness and, once and for all, ending the deliberative process' unlimited length and reducing it to 25 years long, long after a President has left office, is a good start. I want to note that, in the original House bill--one area that I was particularly pleased that Mr. Cummings and I were able to come to an agreement on--if an agency unreasonably delays, there should be a result. If someone has to sue, whether it is The New York Times or an interest group, and, ultimately, the government is unreasonable and is withholding, reasonable fees should be recovered. That isn't in the bill. I hope that it will be in future legislation. The fact is that this bill includes some very important points, not the least of which will be making more public and accessible the repeated request for various parts of FOIA, and, of course, reducing the delays and the time lag. Having said that, through the establishment of a board and the recognition that only through diligence and closing the quality circle that occurs can we come back to this body and say more needs to be done and name it. But today is a day for celebration. I want to thank Mr. Cummings one more time, Chairman Chaffetz, the Members of the House and the Senate, urge the passage of the bill, and recognize that this is, in fact, a 50-year-old law. It has stood the test of time. It has proven to be an asset for the American people and for their right to know. We will build on this. Lastly, and Congresswoman Maloney named it, there were countless outside transparency groups that spanned from the farthest left of our country's politics to the farthest right of our politics, all of whom wanted more open access to their government. Today, we are achieving it. We still will have a government that knows far more about us than we know about our government; but today, we are opening the possibility that, in a timely fashion, more often more people who have a vested interest in knowing something that the government has done or is doing will have the ability to get that information. I thank Congressman Meadows for making this bill possible today. His leadership has been critical, and his friendship has been critical all along the way. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), who has led many of the discussions in this body on criminal justice reform and reform in so many ways, including this bill that he helped author with former Chairman Issa. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I want to thank Mr. Meadows and Mr. Chaffetz and, certainly, Speaker Ryan for getting this bill to the floor. I associate myself completely with the words of the former chairman of our Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. Issa. I don't think there has been anyone who has worked harder on getting this bill to the floor than Mr. Issa. Without a doubt, his fingerprints are all over it. I really do, from the depths of my heart, thank him for all that he has done to make this happen. The FOIA Improvement Act is a product of a 3-year journey--that is a long time--that began when Representative Issa and I first introduced the basis for the bill in 2013. Mr. Issa worked with me on the House version of this bill, and Senators Leahy and Cornyn took the lead in the Senate. Again, I want to thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, for his work on FOIA reform and for his support bringing the bill to the floor. He has proposed some additional initiatives that did not make it into this version of the bill but that deserve continued attention. Even in our negotiations, I give it to Chairman Chaffetz. You know, a lot of times when you are trying to work things out and get things done between the House and the Senate, there has to be some compromise. There are a lot of good things that he wanted in the bill that I strongly supported, but we were not able to get them in. For example, one of his provisions would have required every agency to accept FOIA requests by email. This is a simple improvement that every agency should adopt, and I look forward to working with Chairman Chaffetz in the years ahead on such commonsense reforms. I would like to recognize a few of the staff for both Representatives Issa and Chaffetz who deserve recognition, strong recognition, for the work they put into this legislation over the last few years: Tegan Gelfand, Ali Ahmad, and Katy Rother. I want to thank them for all of the work that they have done in making this happen. In addition, advocacy groups, as Mr. Issa mentioned, such as OpenTheGovernment.org and Sunshine in Government Initiative, as well as experts such as Anne Weismann at Campaign for Accountability, have been critical to the success of this legislation. Finally, I would like to take time to thank our Speaker. His office has been extremely helpful, and he also deserves credit for bringing this bill to the floor today. It simply would not have been possible without his leadership. The FOIA Improvement Act is a truly bicameral, bipartisan bill. With its passage today, it will now go on to the President for his signature. It builds on the work of the Obama administration, which has done more to advance transparency than any administration in history. {time} 1715 The bill would codify the presumption of openness standard that President Obama put in place on his first day in office. The bill would also put a 25-year sunset on exemption No. 5 of FOIA-- the deliberative process exemption. It would modernize FOIA by requiring the Office of Management and Budget to create a central portal to allow FOIA requests to any agency through a single Web site. The Office of Government Information Services, which is the FOIA ombudsman that was created by Congress in 2007, would become more independent under this bill and would be allowed to submit testimony and reports directly to Congress without going through political review. Finally, FOIA officers could share best practices through a Chief FOIA Officers Council that would be established under the bill. These are just some of the examples of the many improvements to FOIA that are contained in this legislation. The FOIA Improvement Act is a big step forward in transparency, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ``fix FOIA by 50.'' Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) for his insightful, well-thought-out words on behalf of this bill. Indeed, Mr. Issa and Mr. Cummings have been a moving force and, really, one of the primary forces as to why we are here today; so I just want to acknowledge that. [[Page H3719]] I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I join my voice with Ranking Member Cummings' in being associated with the words from my friend and colleague from the great State of North Carolina in support of this important legislation and to also compliment not only Elijah Cummings for his leadership, but former Chairman Issa for making this a priority and for helping to move it to the floor and make it happen. This is a good, bipartisan bill. It was worked on diligently by both sides in both the House and the Senate. It is an important step forward for transparency. It is a strengthened bill. It deserves the support of everyone on both sides of the aisle, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I acknowledge the, really, unbelievable work of the staff. Many times, as you well know, Mr. Speaker, we will get up and work very hard, but it is the countless hours on behalf of our staff that really allows us to move legislation forward; so I wouldn't want this day to go by without acknowledging their support and work. Also, I acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Chaffetz in his being able to not only navigate this bill before and, hopefully, to the President's desk for signing, but certainly in his leadership on transparency and in making sure that the government of the people is accountable to the people. I urge the adoption of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rigell). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 337. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_183.csv,38796,38796,38862,"[congressional record volume 162, number 93 (monday, june 13, 2016)] [house] [pages h3714-h3719] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] foia improvement act of 2016 mr. meadows. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (s. 337) to improve the freedom of information act. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: s. 337 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``foia improvement act of 2016''. sec. 2. amendments to foia. section 552 of title 5, united states code, is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)-- (a) in paragraph (2)-- (i) in the matter preceding subparagraph (a), by striking ``for public inspection and copying'' and inserting ``for public inspection in an electronic format'';

mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of s. 337, the foia improvement act of 2016. we stand here today 3 weeks shy of the foia's 50th anniversary to strengthen the law that established the public's right to know. enacted in 1966, foia was the product of more than a decade of work on government secrecy by a predecessor committee to the current oversight and government reform committee. at the time, foia was only the third public information law in the world. it was by far the most far-reaching. foia established a right to information, which is commonly known as the public's right to know. s. 337 reaffirms the public's right to know and puts in place several reforms to stop agencies from slowly eroding the effectiveness of using foia to exercise that right. this bill is a bipartisan effort to improve the public's access to information and transparency in the federal government. i would like to thank senators cornyn, grassley, and leahy for their [[page h3717]] hard work that they put into writing and passing this bill. i would also like to thank representative darrell issa and ranking member elijah cummings for their work on the house bill, h.r. 653, which passed in january. through all of our combined efforts, i believe that this is the best bill we can send to the president's desk. i have no doubt that the reforms contained in this bill will significantly improve the american public's ability to exercise their right to access information. the most important reform is the presumption of openness. now, while some--but far from all--federal agencies have made an effort to comply with the letter of the law, very few have complied with the spirit of the law. the presumption of openness puts that spirit into the letter of the law. before claiming an exemption, agencies must first determine whether they could reasonably foresee an actual harm. foia includes exemptions because publicly releasing information can sometimes cause more harm than good. but from the beginning, agencies have taken advantage of these exemptions to withhold any information that might technically fit. under the presumption of openness, agencies may no longer withhold information that is embarrassing or could possibly paint the agency in a negative light simply because an exemption may technically apply. this will go a long way toward getting rid of the withhold-it-because-you-want-to exemption. s. 337 establishes reforms that will bring attention, leadership, and commitment to improvement to all federal agencies. the department of homeland security is a great example of how attention, leadership, and a commitment to improvement can be more valuable, at times, than additional dollars. from 2009 to 2015, requests sent to dhs nearly tripled. dhs requests accounted for about 40 percent of all the requests governmentwide. as the requests increased, so did the backlog. and in 2014, that backlog at dhs exceeded more than 100,000 requests. however, the agency made a commitment to improve its efficiency and reduce its backlog. in 2015, that backlog was down by two-thirds, to about 35,000. costs overall went up, but that is expected when requests nearly triple in just 6 years. what is not expected is that the cost per request was cut by 58 percent. in 2009, dhs averaged $255 per request processed, and in 2015, the costs had dropped to $148 per request processed. s. 337 establishes reforms that will ensure all agencies have the attention and the leadership necessary to improve the foia process. the bill establishes a chief foia officers council, which is directed to develop initiatives to increase transparency and compliance with foia and make recommendations for increased efficiencies and share best practices. the bill establishes greater independence of the office of government information services, which will allow ogis to give unbiased, unfiltered testimony and recommendations. s. 337 creates an incentive for agencies to comply with the law by preventing agencies from collecting fees for any request for up to 5,000 pages if that request is not completed within the statutory time limits. out-of-date regulations have been repeatedly used as an excuse to withhold information, delay requests, or otherwise to obstruct the process. s. 337 gets rid of this excuse by requiring agencies to update their regulations so that they are operating under the current law. s. 337 also simplifies the process of submitting requests by establishing an online central portal that will allow a member of the public to submit a request to an agency at a single web site rather than forcing the public to navigate each agency's different process and web site. these reforms and others packaged in the foia improvement act will go a long way to improving transparency and bringing agency leadership attention to improving the public's ability to exercise their right to know. mr. speaker, i urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this giant step forward to improve foia and the public's access to information. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1700 mrs. carolyn b. maloney of new york. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of the foia improvement act of 2016, also known as the public's right to know or transparency in government act. it is fitting that we pass this bill to strengthen the freedom of information act just a few weeks before the 50th anniversary of this important law. the national archives and records administration currently has on display the original freedom of information act in celebration of the anniversary on july 4. it is inspiring to think that 50 years have passed and that document is still the most important tool that the public has to access information about their government. when foia was passed in 1966, it was only the third freedom of information law in the entire world, and it was by far the most powerful. now countries all over the world have transparency laws that are modeled on our nation's foia law. we are here today in the ongoing quest to improve foia and to keep it current with changes in technology. i want to thank congressmen issa and cummings for introducing the house version of the bill and senators leahy and cornyn for taking the lead in the senate. this bill is the result of many voices providing feedback and helpful critiques. that is the way a good law is made. advocacy groups such as openthegovernment.org and the sunshine in government initiative have been critical to the success of this legislation. the foia improvement act is a bicameral, bipartisan bill. with its passage today, it will now go on to the president for his signature. the bill would codify the presumption of openness standard that president obama put in place on his first day in office. under this standard, agencies will be required to err on the side of transparency when responding to requests. the bill would also put a 25-year sunset on exemption 5 of foia, the deliberative process exemption. it would modernize foia by requiring the office of management and budget to create a central foia web site for requesters to submit their request, making it more efficient and accessible to the public. this bill would strengthen the independence and the role of the office of government information services. ogis has served a critical role since it was formed in response to the last foia reform congress adopted in 2007. i would like to take a moment to thank the hardworking federal employees who serve as foia officers. they are dedicated professionals who care about making foia work. it is critical that congress provide the funds necessary for agencies to have strong foia programs with experienced and trained foia professionals. it is not reasonable for us to ask agencies to do more if we do not give them the resources to do it. the foia improvement act would require each agency to designate a chief foia officer. the chief foia officer would have responsibility for ensuring that foia is implemented efficiently and appropriately in the agency. i hope this addition to foia will help elevate the importance of foia in agencies that have not always given it the attention it deserves. thank you to the many foia professionals who have provided feedback on the bill over the past 3 years. thank you also to the foia requesters who provided feedback, requesters such as nate jones from the national security archive and david mccraw from the new york times. they all provided useful suggestions for reform. i understand that some proposals did not make it into the final bill, but they did shape the debate and will help us as we look forward to future reforms. a los angeles times editorial said: ``worthy of not only obama's signature, but also his vocal support.'' a new york times editorial said: ``this is a rare chance to log a significant bipartisan accomplishment in the public interest.'' enactment of this legislation will be an important step forward for transparency. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. meadows. mr. speaker, i would like to thank the gentlewoman from [[page h3718]] new york (mrs. carolyn b. maloney) for her support on this bill. i yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. issa), who has spent a considerable amount of time not only on the house version, but really helping shape the debate on making sure that the public interests of america is protected. mr. issa. mr. speaker, this has been a long time coming, and there is a lot of thanks to go around. certainly for senator cornyn and senator leahy, this is going to be a proud week with the passage of this bill in the house and, ultimately, it going to the president. i don't believe this would have been possible without the partnership that elijah cummings and i formed some years ago. the house has led in not just one, but in two congresses, sending to the senate very tough language dramatically improving what we see as the flaws in foia that have developed. congresswoman maloney, very rightfully so, said there are a lot of things that the interest groups and congressman cummings and myself and, perhaps, everyone else who will vote on it here today would like to have seen. i don't want to belabor the point, but when this bill becomes law and is signed by the president, there will be enough left for a new bill to start again. having said that, we celebrate today the fact that we have made some milestones. codifying in law the presumption of openness and, once and for all, ending the deliberative process' unlimited length and reducing it to 25 years long, long after a president has left office, is a good start. i want to note that, in the original house bill--one area that i was particularly pleased that mr. cummings and i were able to come to an agreement on--if an agency unreasonably delays, there should be a result. if someone has to sue, whether it is the new york times or an interest group, and, ultimately, the government is unreasonable and is withholding, reasonable fees should be recovered. that isn't in the bill. i hope that it will be in future legislation. the fact is that this bill includes some very important points, not the least of which will be making more public and accessible the repeated request for various parts of foia, and, of course, reducing the delays and the time lag. having said that, through the establishment of a board and the recognition that only through diligence and closing the quality circle that occurs can we come back to this body and say more needs to be done and name it. but today is a day for celebration. i want to thank mr. cummings one more time, chairman chaffetz, the members of the house and the senate, urge the passage of the bill, and recognize that this is, in fact, a 50-year-old law. it has stood the test of time. it has proven to be an asset for the american people and for their right to know. we will build on this. lastly, and congresswoman maloney named it, there were countless outside transparency groups that spanned from the farthest left of our country's politics to the farthest right of our politics, all of whom wanted more open access to their government. today, we are achieving it. we still will have a government that knows far more about us than we know about our government; but today, we are opening the possibility that, in a timely fashion, more often more people who have a vested interest in knowing something that the government has done or is doing will have the ability to get that information. i thank congressman meadows for making this bill possible today. his leadership has been critical, and his friendship has been critical all along the way. mrs. carolyn b. maloney of new york. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from maryland (mr. cummings), who has led many of the discussions in this body on criminal justice reform and reform in so many ways, including this bill that he helped author with former chairman issa. mr. cummings. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding. i want to thank mr. meadows and mr. chaffetz and, certainly, speaker ryan for getting this bill to the floor. i associate myself completely with the words of the former chairman of our oversight and government reform committee, mr. issa. i don't think there has been anyone who has worked harder on getting this bill to the floor than mr. issa. without a doubt, his fingerprints are all over it. i really do, from the depths of my heart, thank him for all that he has done to make this happen. the foia improvement act is a product of a 3-year journey--that is a long time--that began when representative issa and i first introduced the basis for the bill in 2013. mr. issa worked with me on the house version of this bill, and senators leahy and cornyn took the lead in the senate. again, i want to thank the chairman of the oversight and government reform committee, jason chaffetz, for his work on foia reform and for his support bringing the bill to the floor. he has proposed some additional initiatives that did not make it into this version of the bill but that deserve continued attention. even in our negotiations, i give it to chairman chaffetz. you know, a lot of times when you are trying to work things out and get things done between the house and the senate, there has to be some compromise. there are a lot of good things that he wanted in the bill that i strongly supported, but we were not able to get them in. for example, one of his provisions would have required every agency to accept foia requests by email. this is a simple improvement that every agency should adopt, and i look forward to working with chairman chaffetz in the years ahead on such commonsense reforms. i would like to recognize a few of the staff for both representatives issa and chaffetz who deserve recognition, strong recognition, for the work they put into this legislation over the last few years: tegan gelfand, ali ahmad, and katy rother. i want to thank them for all of the work that they have done in making this happen. in addition, advocacy groups, as mr. issa mentioned, such as openthegovernment.org and sunshine in government initiative, as well as experts such as anne weismann at campaign for accountability, have been critical to the success of this legislation. finally, i would like to take time to thank our speaker. his office has been extremely helpful, and he also deserves credit for bringing this bill to the floor today. it simply would not have been possible without his leadership. the foia improvement act is a truly bicameral, bipartisan bill. with its passage today, it will now go on to the president for his signature. it builds on the work of the obama administration, which has done more to advance transparency than any administration in history. {time} 1715 the bill would codify the presumption of openness standard that president obama put in place on his first day in office. the bill would also put a 25-year sunset on exemption no. 5 of foia-- the deliberative process exemption. it would modernize foia by requiring the office of management and budget to create a central portal to allow foia requests to any agency through a single web site. the office of government information services, which is the foia ombudsman that was created by congress in 2007, would become more independent under this bill and would be allowed to submit testimony and reports directly to congress without going through political review. finally, foia officers could share best practices through a chief foia officers council that would be established under the bill. these are just some of the examples of the many improvements to foia that are contained in this legislation. the foia improvement act is a big step forward in transparency, and i urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ``fix foia by 50.'' mr. meadows. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i thank the gentleman from maryland (mr. cummings) for his insightful, well-thought-out words on behalf of this bill. indeed, mr. issa and mr. cummings have been a moving force and, really, one of the primary forces as to why we are here today; so i just want to acknowledge that. [[page h3719]] i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. carolyn b. maloney of new york. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. i join my voice with ranking member cummings' in being associated with the words from my friend and colleague from the great state of north carolina in support of this important legislation and to also compliment not only elijah cummings for his leadership, but former chairman issa for making this a priority and for helping to move it to the floor and make it happen. this is a good, bipartisan bill. it was worked on diligently by both sides in both the house and the senate. it is an important step forward for transparency. it is a strengthened bill. it deserves the support of everyone on both sides of the aisle, and i urge my colleagues to support it. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. meadows. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i acknowledge the, really, unbelievable work of the staff. many times, as you well know, mr. speaker, we will get up and work very hard, but it is the countless hours on behalf of our staff that really allows us to move legislation forward; so i wouldn't want this day to go by without acknowledging their support and work. also, i acknowledge the leadership of chairman chaffetz in his being able to not only navigate this bill before and, hopefully, to the president's desk for signing, but certainly in his leadership on transparency and in making sure that the government of the people is accountable to the people. i urge the adoption of this bill. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore (mr. rigell). the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from north carolina (mr. meadows) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, s. 337. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",38796

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. General Leave Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5312, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. First off, I would like to thank Chairman Lamar Smith for his hard work in bringing this bill through the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and my colleague, Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson, for her leadership in introducing this bipartisan legislation with me. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program, also known as the NITRD Program, is the primary Federal research and development investment portfolio in unclassified networking, computing, software, cybersecurity, and related information technologies. In my district, the NITRD Program supports Federal investment in research at universities like Western Illinois University in Macomb, Illinois, and the Blue Waters supercomputer at the University of Illinois in Urbana, Illinois. NITRD also supports public-private partnerships between high-performance supercomputing and private [[Page H3712]] corporations like, Caterpillar Corporation, based in Peoria, Illinois. Information technology is all around us in our day-to-day lives--on our smartphones, in our cars, and in our homes. It improves our way of life, even in ways that are not always visible or apparent. As technology rapidly advances, the need for research and development continues to evolve. The NITRD Program works to prevent duplicative and overlapping efforts in this space, thereby enabling more efficient use of government resources and taxpayer dollars, while also supporting new and innovative research and development efforts at our Nation's universities and through public-private partnerships. This bill implements several important policies to help lead the way for future technological innovations and modernize the NITRD Program. Specifically, the bill improves the program in the following ways: First, it establishes a strategic planning and review process for the NITRD investment portfolio, with clear metrics and objectives. Second, it works to improve interagency as well as government and private sector coordination and communication. Third, it focuses the NITRD investment portfolio on areas of national interest and increasing importance like data analytics, privacy protection, and human-computer systems. These changes to current law will reduce bureaucracy and ensure that hardworking Americans' taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and effectively. Important to note, this legislation authorizes no new spending. Smart investments in information technology research and development are crucial for our Nation. Work in related areas bolsters economic competitiveness and creates new industries and businesses; it helps ensure future national security, including cybersecurity; and creates the good-paying jobs we need for today and tomorrow. As such, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation to modernize NITRD and streamline Federal research and development investment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. The bill before us modernizes the original High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. In the 25 years that have passed since that bill established the framework for Federal investment in computing research, networking and information technologies, NIT, has transformed how we communicate with each other, how we get around, how we bank, and how we shop. NIT has helped provide teachers and students in diverse communities across our Nation access to resources and learning opportunities that were previously out of reach. NIT has transformed every industry sector, increasing efficiency and productivity, while creating higher skilled, better paying jobs. NIT made possible the decoding of the human genome and has led to myriad improvements in medical diagnostics and treatments. Over these past 25 years, networking and information technologies have created opportunities across all aspects of our lives that were previously unimaginable. With those opportunities, NIT has also created new challenges for individual and collective safety and security and for our privacy. Our critical infrastructure, our banks, our commercial enterprises, and our own personal wallets and identities are vulnerable to criminals and state actors alike. Our privacy is being compromised daily, whether we are public figures or private citizens. We cannot go back to a world before NIT, nor should we. However, while investing in advancements in NIT and its many applications, we must also invest in protecting our security and privacy. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program, or NITRD, which grew out of the original 1991 High-Performance Computing Act, does just that. The interagency NITRD Program supports a full range of research and development that provides the foundation of scientific understanding and accelerates the development of advanced information technologies, while strengthening cybersecurity and privacy. The program also advances NIT to accelerate discovery in many other areas of science and engineering, from astronomy to biomedical research. The legislation we are considering today, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act, continues to strengthen the management, coordination, and oversight of the NITRD Program. It helps ensure that Federal investments in NIT R&D remain at the cutting edge and continuously evolve to include important emerging areas of NIT. In addition, it encourages large-scale interdisciplinary and cross-agency collaborations in ``grand challenge'' areas of R&D. Finally, the bill encourages strong collaboration and coordination with industry and other stakeholders. Over time, there have been some amendments to the 1991 Act. H.R. 5312, represents the committee's fourth attempt in as many Congresses to enact a comprehensive modernization of the 25-year-old law. For the first time since our first effort in 2009, the Senate has proposed draft language of its own. I am hopeful that we can get a NITRD modernization bill to the President's desk before year's end. Given the profound implications for our economic and national security, NIT is not an area of science and technology for which the U.S. can afford to cede leadership. I want to thank Representative LaHood, Chairman Smith, and committee staff for an open, collaborative, and good process which has led to a very good bill. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood) for taking the initiative on this innovation bill. And I am also pleased that the ranking member, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), is a cosponsor of H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. Mr. Speaker, in this digital age, advancing and protecting our Nation's computing and networking systems is more important than ever. This legislation ensures that Federal science agencies focus on networking and information technology priorities that are in the national interest, and it provides the coordinating R&D efforts necessary to improve cyber and data security nationwide. Better network security promotes U.S. competitiveness, enhances national security, and creates high-tech jobs. The NITRD Modernization bill is an update to the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. The authorized program represents the Federal Government's main R&D portfolio for unclassified advanced networking, computing, software, cybersecurity, and related information technologies. Currently, 21 Federal agencies are contributing members of NITRD, with many additional agencies participating in the program. This bill serves as the mechanism for interagency coordination of R&D to produce a tighter focus without wasteful duplication of research efforts among Federal agencies or the private sector. This will help save taxpayers' dollars. It also rebalances agency R&D portfolios to focus less on short-term, incremental approaches and much more on large-scale, long- term interdisciplinary research to transform and enable new computing capabilities. Federal agencies are expected to invest more than $4.4 billion in fiscal year 2017 on NITRD Program activities. These investments go toward basic research at the frontiers of high-end computing, networking, and information technology. More than $1.1 billion of this is invested by the National Science Foundation and $720 million by the Department of Energy. This taxpayer-funded basic research is intended to keep the United States [[Page H3713]] the global leader in high-end computing and networking, which is crucial to our future economic and national security. The bill does this by updating and reforming the underlying High-Performance Computing statute to reflect the current mature state of our vibrant computing industry. It also codifies the NITRD National Coordination Office, housed within the National Science Foundation, to oversee the participating agencies. The NITRD Program has eight strategic priorities for its enabling research: cybersecurity, autonomous robotic systems, high-end computing and applications, exascale computing, human-computer interaction, large-scale networking, workforce development, and software design. Technologies that develop from these research priorities are used by the commercial sector and the government to protect and enhance emergency communications, the power grid, air traffic control systems, our national energy resources, scientific discovery, human exploration, new product development, and national defense systems. Advanced networking and information technology supports and boosts American discovery and innovation, improves our international competitiveness, expands the U.S. economy, and, of course, creates millions of jobs. Mr. Speaker, American job creators also recognize the importance of networking and information technology research and development. {time} 1645 Many industry partners and stakeholders have written letters in support of this bill. They include the Computing Research Association, the Computing Technology Industry Association, the Information Technology Industry Council, and the Texas A&M University System. As shown by hearings that the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology has held this Congress, including the most recent on the FDIC, cyber breaches are becoming all too commonplace. This legislation encourages agencies to increase understanding of ways to detect, prevent, and recover from actions that compromise or threaten computer- based systems. I again thank our Science, Space, and Technology Committee colleague, Representative LaHood, for his efforts on this issue, and I also commend Majority Leader McCarthy for his vision in establishing a focused innovation initiative in the House of which this legislation is a part. Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5312. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I urge a positive vote on the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk). Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding his time. Mr. Speaker, I chair the Oversight Subcommittee on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and my subcommittee has held numerous hearings on the ever-evolving threat of cyber intrusions. I also owned and operated an information technology company for more than 20 years, so I know firsthand the importance of safeguarding sensitive information and private customer data. Regrettably, as we have seen through many unfortunate examples, the American people have good reason to question whether their private information is being properly secured. That is why I am pleased to support H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. This legislation ensures that Federal science agencies focus on networking and information technology priorities that are in the national interest, and also provides the coordinated research and development efforts necessary to improve cyber and data security nationwide. The bill also encourages agencies to increase understanding of ways to detect, prevent, and recover from actions that threaten computer systems. This legislation will help stimulate innovation in the technology sector and will enable our Nation to better understand and secure its systems for the future. I thank my Science, Space, and Technology Committee colleague (Mr. LaHood) for his work on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), my colleague and friend from Illinois. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Mr. LaHood, Chairman Smith, and Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson. This is a piece of legislation that may not get a lot of publicity, but it is essential to our research capabilities and supercomputing capabilities for our future right here in this country. The United States of America needs to continue to lead in this arena. Who would have thought that while they were writing the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, it would have to be amended because of innovation that we have seen at many of our universities throughout this great country. I am obviously in support of H.R. 5312 because it is going to streamline Federal investment in high-end computing, benefiting local entities in Illinois that use advanced technologies, such as the University of Illinois in my district, Caterpillar, and Western Illinois University that is served so well by Congressman LaHood. This legislation ensures that the University of Illinois, the home to nationally recognized scientists and the Blue Waters Supercomputer, can continue to be the leader that they are in the fields of networking and computing. The National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is funded by many Federal agencies and has an impressive history of providing integrated cyber infrastructure to scientists, engineers, and scholars across the country. Addressing complex problems in today's science and society requires expertise and engagement from multiple disciplines. NCSA is committed to continuing to serve as a central hub for transdisciplinary teams to unite in making technological advancements. These important research programs are critical for coordinating Federal research and fostering revolutionary breakthroughs in computing, networking, software, and cybersecurity. By streamlining the NITRD Program, we can ensure U.S. competitiveness in advanced technologies while improving collaboration between Federal agencies, national laboratories, private industry, and academia. Mr. Speaker, this bill is an effective use of taxpayer dollars. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letters of support mentioned by Chairman Smith, including the letter from the University of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 5312. I yield back the balance of my time. University of Illinois, Champaign, IL, June 13, 2016. Hon. Darin LaHood, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Representative LaHood: The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Urbana) is pleased to endorse H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Modernization Act of 2016. The NITRD program plays a critical role in coordinating federal investments in Information Technology (IT) research and development to better enable and equip research communities in addressing complex grand challenges in science, engineering, and society. Coordination and integration is increasingly important in the IT ecosystem. This is particularly true for high performance computing (HPC) and Big Data. At Urbana, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) serves as a world-class hub of transdisciplinary research and digital scholarship in which collaborators from across the globe unite to solve real-world problems. NCSA leads the two single largest National Science Foundation (NSF) investments in high-end computing and data analysis--the NSF Blue Waters supercomputer, the most powerful supercomputer in the academic world, and the NSF Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project, which provides collaborative and shared computing services to the HPC community. These two computing projects support thousands of researchers from across the nation whose research is funded separately by numerous federal agencies. By providing unique science capabilities, these facilities are catalyzing significant discoveries.

Re H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016 Hon. Paul D. Ryan, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,Washington, DC. Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the 60 members of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), I write to express our support for H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Modernization Act of 2016. The NITRD Program ensures the proper coordination of unclassified networking and information technology (NIT) research and development (R&D) across multiple federal agencies. More specifically, the Program aims to avoid investment redundancies, as well as increase interoperability in supercomputing, high-speed networking, cybersecurity, software engineering, and information management. However, since its inception in 1991, there have been unprecedented technological advances that are not currently addressed in the Program's overall structure. H.R. 5312 comprehensively modernizes the Program by updating essential terminology throughout the underlying law; addressing new areas of NIT research; and encouraging large-scale, long-term, interagency research in critical areas such as data analytics, social computing, human-robot interaction, privacy, and health technology. The Program plays a key role in supporting continuous federal research in various aspects related to computing, including cybersecurity. Promoting greater federal R&D in cybersecurity is essential for securing our country's digital infrastructure. Consequently, we urge you to support the NITRD Modernization Act when it comes to the floor for a vote. Sincerely, Dean C. Garfield, President and CEO. ____ Computing Research Association, Washington, DC, May 23 2016. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Washington, DC. Hon.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. General Leave Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5312, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. First off, I would like to thank Chairman Lamar Smith for his hard work in bringing this bill through the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and my colleague, Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson, for her leadership in introducing this bipartisan legislation with me. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program, also known as the NITRD Program, is the primary Federal research and development investment portfolio in unclassified networking, computing, software, cybersecurity, and related information technologies. In my district, the NITRD Program supports Federal investment in research at universities like Western Illinois University in Macomb, Illinois, and the Blue Waters supercomputer at the University of Illinois in Urbana, Illinois. NITRD also supports public-private partnerships between high-performance supercomputing and private [[Page H3712]] corporations like, Caterpillar Corporation, based in Peoria, Illinois. Information technology is all around us in our day-to-day lives--on our smartphones, in our cars, and in our homes. It improves our way of life, even in ways that are not always visible or apparent. As technology rapidly advances, the need for research and development continues to evolve. The NITRD Program works to prevent duplicative and overlapping efforts in this space, thereby enabling more efficient use of government resources and taxpayer dollars, while also supporting new and innovative research and development efforts at our Nation's universities and through public-private partnerships. This bill implements several important policies to help lead the way for future technological innovations and modernize the NITRD Program. Specifically, the bill improves the program in the following ways: First, it establishes a strategic planning and review process for the NITRD investment portfolio, with clear metrics and objectives. Second, it works to improve interagency as well as government and private sector coordination and communication. Third, it focuses the NITRD investment portfolio on areas of national interest and increasing importance like data analytics, privacy protection, and human-computer systems. These changes to current law will reduce bureaucracy and ensure that hardworking Americans' taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and effectively. Important to note, this legislation authorizes no new spending. Smart investments in information technology research and development are crucial for our Nation. Work in related areas bolsters economic competitiveness and creates new industries and businesses; it helps ensure future national security, including cybersecurity; and creates the good-paying jobs we need for today and tomorrow. As such, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation to modernize NITRD and streamline Federal research and development investment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. The bill before us modernizes the original High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. In the 25 years that have passed since that bill established the framework for Federal investment in computing research, networking and information technologies, NIT, has transformed how we communicate with each other, how we get around, how we bank, and how we shop. NIT has helped provide teachers and students in diverse communities across our Nation access to resources and learning opportunities that were previously out of reach. NIT has transformed every industry sector, increasing efficiency and productivity, while creating higher skilled, better paying jobs. NIT made possible the decoding of the human genome and has led to myriad improvements in medical diagnostics and treatments. Over these past 25 years, networking and information technologies have created opportunities across all aspects of our lives that were previously unimaginable. With those opportunities, NIT has also created new challenges for individual and collective safety and security and for our privacy. Our critical infrastructure, our banks, our commercial enterprises, and our own personal wallets and identities are vulnerable to criminals and state actors alike. Our privacy is being compromised daily, whether we are public figures or private citizens. We cannot go back to a world before NIT, nor should we. However, while investing in advancements in NIT and its many applications, we must also invest in protecting our security and privacy. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program, or NITRD, which grew out of the original 1991 High-Performance Computing Act, does just that. The interagency NITRD Program supports a full range of research and development that provides the foundation of scientific understanding and accelerates the development of advanced information technologies, while strengthening cybersecurity and privacy. The program also advances NIT to accelerate discovery in many other areas of science and engineering, from astronomy to biomedical research. The legislation we are considering today, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act, continues to strengthen the management, coordination, and oversight of the NITRD Program. It helps ensure that Federal investments in NIT R&D remain at the cutting edge and continuously evolve to include important emerging areas of NIT. In addition, it encourages large-scale interdisciplinary and cross-agency collaborations in ``grand challenge'' areas of R&D. Finally, the bill encourages strong collaboration and coordination with industry and other stakeholders. Over time, there have been some amendments to the 1991 Act. H.R. 5312, represents the committee's fourth attempt in as many Congresses to enact a comprehensive modernization of the 25-year-old law. For the first time since our first effort in 2009, the Senate has proposed draft language of its own. I am hopeful that we can get a NITRD modernization bill to the President's desk before year's end. Given the profound implications for our economic and national security, NIT is not an area of science and technology for which the U.S. can afford to cede leadership. I want to thank Representative LaHood, Chairman Smith, and committee staff for an open, collaborative, and good process which has led to a very good bill. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood) for taking the initiative on this innovation bill. And I am also pleased that the ranking member, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), is a cosponsor of H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. Mr. Speaker, in this digital age, advancing and protecting our Nation's computing and networking systems is more important than ever. This legislation ensures that Federal science agencies focus on networking and information technology priorities that are in the national interest, and it provides the coordinating R&D efforts necessary to improve cyber and data security nationwide. Better network security promotes U.S. competitiveness, enhances national security, and creates high-tech jobs. The NITRD Modernization bill is an update to the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. The authorized program represents the Federal Government's main R&D portfolio for unclassified advanced networking, computing, software, cybersecurity, and related information technologies. Currently, 21 Federal agencies are contributing members of NITRD, with many additional agencies participating in the program. This bill serves as the mechanism for interagency coordination of R&D to produce a tighter focus without wasteful duplication of research efforts among Federal agencies or the private sector. This will help save taxpayers' dollars. It also rebalances agency R&D portfolios to focus less on short-term, incremental approaches and much more on large-scale, long- term interdisciplinary research to transform and enable new computing capabilities. Federal agencies are expected to invest more than $4.4 billion in fiscal year 2017 on NITRD Program activities. These investments go toward basic research at the frontiers of high-end computing, networking, and information technology. More than $1.1 billion of this is invested by the National Science Foundation and $720 million by the Department of Energy. This taxpayer-funded basic research is intended to keep the United States [[Page H3713]] the global leader in high-end computing and networking, which is crucial to our future economic and national security. The bill does this by updating and reforming the underlying High-Performance Computing statute to reflect the current mature state of our vibrant computing industry. It also codifies the NITRD National Coordination Office, housed within the National Science Foundation, to oversee the participating agencies. The NITRD Program has eight strategic priorities for its enabling research: cybersecurity, autonomous robotic systems, high-end computing and applications, exascale computing, human-computer interaction, large-scale networking, workforce development, and software design. Technologies that develop from these research priorities are used by the commercial sector and the government to protect and enhance emergency communications, the power grid, air traffic control systems, our national energy resources, scientific discovery, human exploration, new product development, and national defense systems. Advanced networking and information technology supports and boosts American discovery and innovation, improves our international competitiveness, expands the U.S. economy, and, of course, creates millions of jobs. Mr. Speaker, American job creators also recognize the importance of networking and information technology research and development. {time} 1645 Many industry partners and stakeholders have written letters in support of this bill. They include the Computing Research Association, the Computing Technology Industry Association, the Information Technology Industry Council, and the Texas A&M University System. As shown by hearings that the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology has held this Congress, including the most recent on the FDIC, cyber breaches are becoming all too commonplace. This legislation encourages agencies to increase understanding of ways to detect, prevent, and recover from actions that compromise or threaten computer- based systems. I again thank our Science, Space, and Technology Committee colleague, Representative LaHood, for his efforts on this issue, and I also commend Majority Leader McCarthy for his vision in establishing a focused innovation initiative in the House of which this legislation is a part. Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5312. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I urge a positive vote on the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk). Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding his time. Mr. Speaker, I chair the Oversight Subcommittee on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and my subcommittee has held numerous hearings on the ever-evolving threat of cyber intrusions. I also owned and operated an information technology company for more than 20 years, so I know firsthand the importance of safeguarding sensitive information and private customer data. Regrettably, as we have seen through many unfortunate examples, the American people have good reason to question whether their private information is being properly secured. That is why I am pleased to support H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. This legislation ensures that Federal science agencies focus on networking and information technology priorities that are in the national interest, and also provides the coordinated research and development efforts necessary to improve cyber and data security nationwide. The bill also encourages agencies to increase understanding of ways to detect, prevent, and recover from actions that threaten computer systems. This legislation will help stimulate innovation in the technology sector and will enable our Nation to better understand and secure its systems for the future. I thank my Science, Space, and Technology Committee colleague (Mr. LaHood) for his work on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), my colleague and friend from Illinois. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Mr. LaHood, Chairman Smith, and Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson. This is a piece of legislation that may not get a lot of publicity, but it is essential to our research capabilities and supercomputing capabilities for our future right here in this country. The United States of America needs to continue to lead in this arena. Who would have thought that while they were writing the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, it would have to be amended because of innovation that we have seen at many of our universities throughout this great country. I am obviously in support of H.R. 5312 because it is going to streamline Federal investment in high-end computing, benefiting local entities in Illinois that use advanced technologies, such as the University of Illinois in my district, Caterpillar, and Western Illinois University that is served so well by Congressman LaHood. This legislation ensures that the University of Illinois, the home to nationally recognized scientists and the Blue Waters Supercomputer, can continue to be the leader that they are in the fields of networking and computing. The National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is funded by many Federal agencies and has an impressive history of providing integrated cyber infrastructure to scientists, engineers, and scholars across the country. Addressing complex problems in today's science and society requires expertise and engagement from multiple disciplines. NCSA is committed to continuing to serve as a central hub for transdisciplinary teams to unite in making technological advancements. These important research programs are critical for coordinating Federal research and fostering revolutionary breakthroughs in computing, networking, software, and cybersecurity. By streamlining the NITRD Program, we can ensure U.S. competitiveness in advanced technologies while improving collaboration between Federal agencies, national laboratories, private industry, and academia. Mr. Speaker, this bill is an effective use of taxpayer dollars. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letters of support mentioned by Chairman Smith, including the letter from the University of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 5312. I yield back the balance of my time. University of Illinois, Champaign, IL, June 13, 2016. Hon. Darin LaHood, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Representative LaHood: The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Urbana) is pleased to endorse H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Modernization Act of 2016. The NITRD program plays a critical role in coordinating federal investments in Information Technology (IT) research and development to better enable and equip research communities in addressing complex grand challenges in science, engineering, and society. Coordination and integration is increasingly important in the IT ecosystem. This is particularly true for high performance computing (HPC) and Big Data. At Urbana, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) serves as a world-class hub of transdisciplinary research and digital scholarship in which collaborators from across the globe unite to solve real-world problems. NCSA leads the two single largest National Science Foundation (NSF) investments in high-end computing and data analysis--the NSF Blue Waters supercomputer, the most powerful supercomputer in the academic world, and the NSF Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project, which provides collaborative and shared computing services to the HPC community. These two computing projects support thousands of researchers from across the nation whose research is funded separately by numerous federal agencies. By providing unique science capabilities, these facilities are catalyzing significant discoveries. [[Page H3714]] In this highly competitive world, we applaud your efforts to lead this legislation to maintain U.S. leadership in research and innovation. Sincerely, Barbara J.

As a leader in cybersecurity and information technology research and education, Texas A&M University is proud to partner with industry and Federal agencies to provide solutions to some of our nation's most vexing issues. The National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated Texas A&M University as a National Center of Academic Excellence, both in education and in research. This well-regarded designation places Texas A&M among a select group of only 30 universities that have earned both distinctions. Further the Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service (TEEX) provides a wide variety of online cybersecurity training for community leaders and businesses from cyberlaw and white collar crime to ethics to risk management and network vulnerability assessment. Given the rapidly expanding workforce needs in this area, Texas A&M prides itself on preparing students and professionals to keep our nation competitive. We are grateful for your leadership of the Science Committee and the work that you have put into this legislation. We look forward to continuing our work with you in the coming months and years. Sincerely, John Sharp, Chancellor. ____ Information Technology Industry Council, Washington, DC, June 10, 2016. Re H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016 Hon. Paul D. Ryan, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,Washington, DC. Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the 60 members of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), I write to express our support for H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Modernization Act of 2016. The NITRD Program ensures the proper coordination of unclassified networking and information technology (NIT) research and development (R&D) across multiple federal agencies. More specifically, the Program aims to avoid investment redundancies, as well as increase interoperability in supercomputing, high-speed networking, cybersecurity, software engineering, and information management. However, since its inception in 1991, there have been unprecedented technological advances that are not currently addressed in the Program's overall structure. H.R. 5312 comprehensively modernizes the Program by updating essential terminology throughout the underlying law; addressing new areas of NIT research; and encouraging large-scale, long-term, interagency research in critical areas such as data analytics, social computing, human-robot interaction, privacy, and health technology. The Program plays a key role in supporting continuous federal research in various aspects related to computing, including cybersecurity. Promoting greater federal R&D in cybersecurity is essential for securing our country's digital infrastructure. Consequently, we urge you to support the NITRD Modernization Act when it comes to the floor for a vote. Sincerely, Dean C. Garfield, President and CEO. ____ Computing Research Association, Washington, DC, May 23 2016. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Ranking Member, House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Washington. DC. Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Johnson: As an organization representing over 240 industry and academic institutions involved in computing research and six affiliated professional societies, the Computing Research Association is pleased to support your efforts to bolster Federal information technology research through the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. As you are aware, advances in information technology are transforming all aspects of our lives. Virtually every human endeavor today has been touched by information technology, including commerce, education. employment, health care, energy, manufacturing, governance, national security, communications, the environment, entertainment, science and engineering. The profound reach of IT is enabled in large part by the innovations that spawn from the IT research ecosystem--that incredibly productive, yet complex interplay of industry, universities and the Federal government. Indeed, nearly every sub-sector of the IT economy today bears the stamp of Federal support. The program responsible for overseeing this crucial investment is the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program. We believe this Act makes the NITRD program stronger by improving the planning and coordination of the National Coordination Office for NITRD, requiring that the NCO and the NITRD agencies create a five-year strategic plan for the program, and requiring the periodic review and assessment of the program contents and funding. All have been recommendations of the President's Council of Advisors for Science and Technology in their recent reviews of the program. We thank you for your work on this legislation and for your long-standing support of the Federal investment in IT research. We look forward to working with you and your colleagues as you endeavor to move the legislation forward this session. Sincerely, Susan B.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. General Leave Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5312, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. First off, I would like to thank Chairman Lamar Smith for his hard work in bringing this bill through the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and my colleague, Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson, for her leadership in introducing this bipartisan legislation with me. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program, also known as the NITRD Program, is the primary Federal research and development investment portfolio in unclassified networking, computing, software, cybersecurity, and related information technologies. In my district, the NITRD Program supports Federal investment in research at universities like Western Illinois University in Macomb, Illinois, and the Blue Waters supercomputer at the University of Illinois in Urbana, Illinois. NITRD also supports public-private partnerships between high-performance supercomputing and private [[Page H3712]] corporations like, Caterpillar Corporation, based in Peoria, Illinois. Information technology is all around us in our day-to-day lives--on our smartphones, in our cars, and in our homes. It improves our way of life, even in ways that are not always visible or apparent. As technology rapidly advances, the need for research and development continues to evolve. The NITRD Program works to prevent duplicative and overlapping efforts in this space, thereby enabling more efficient use of government resources and taxpayer dollars, while also supporting new and innovative research and development efforts at our Nation's universities and through public-private partnerships. This bill implements several important policies to help lead the way for future technological innovations and modernize the NITRD Program. Specifically, the bill improves the program in the following ways: First, it establishes a strategic planning and review process for the NITRD investment portfolio, with clear metrics and objectives. Second, it works to improve interagency as well as government and private sector coordination and communication. Third, it focuses the NITRD investment portfolio on areas of national interest and increasing importance like data analytics, privacy protection, and human-computer systems. These changes to current law will reduce bureaucracy and ensure that hardworking Americans' taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and effectively. Important to note, this legislation authorizes no new spending. Smart investments in information technology research and development are crucial for our Nation. Work in related areas bolsters economic competitiveness and creates new industries and businesses; it helps ensure future national security, including cybersecurity; and creates the good-paying jobs we need for today and tomorrow. As such, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation to modernize NITRD and streamline Federal research and development investment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. The bill before us modernizes the original High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. In the 25 years that have passed since that bill established the framework for Federal investment in computing research, networking and information technologies, NIT, has transformed how we communicate with each other, how we get around, how we bank, and how we shop. NIT has helped provide teachers and students in diverse communities across our Nation access to resources and learning opportunities that were previously out of reach. NIT has transformed every industry sector, increasing efficiency and productivity, while creating higher skilled, better paying jobs. NIT made possible the decoding of the human genome and has led to myriad improvements in medical diagnostics and treatments. Over these past 25 years, networking and information technologies have created opportunities across all aspects of our lives that were previously unimaginable. With those opportunities, NIT has also created new challenges for individual and collective safety and security and for our privacy. Our critical infrastructure, our banks, our commercial enterprises, and our own personal wallets and identities are vulnerable to criminals and state actors alike. Our privacy is being compromised daily, whether we are public figures or private citizens. We cannot go back to a world before NIT, nor should we. However, while investing in advancements in NIT and its many applications, we must also invest in protecting our security and privacy. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program, or NITRD, which grew out of the original 1991 High-Performance Computing Act, does just that. The interagency NITRD Program supports a full range of research and development that provides the foundation of scientific understanding and accelerates the development of advanced information technologies, while strengthening cybersecurity and privacy. The program also advances NIT to accelerate discovery in many other areas of science and engineering, from astronomy to biomedical research. The legislation we are considering today, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act, continues to strengthen the management, coordination, and oversight of the NITRD Program. It helps ensure that Federal investments in NIT R&D remain at the cutting edge and continuously evolve to include important emerging areas of NIT. In addition, it encourages large-scale interdisciplinary and cross-agency collaborations in ``grand challenge'' areas of R&D. Finally, the bill encourages strong collaboration and coordination with industry and other stakeholders. Over time, there have been some amendments to the 1991 Act. H.R. 5312, represents the committee's fourth attempt in as many Congresses to enact a comprehensive modernization of the 25-year-old law. For the first time since our first effort in 2009, the Senate has proposed draft language of its own. I am hopeful that we can get a NITRD modernization bill to the President's desk before year's end. Given the profound implications for our economic and national security, NIT is not an area of science and technology for which the U.S. can afford to cede leadership. I want to thank Representative LaHood, Chairman Smith, and committee staff for an open, collaborative, and good process which has led to a very good bill. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood) for taking the initiative on this innovation bill. And I am also pleased that the ranking member, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), is a cosponsor of H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. Mr. Speaker, in this digital age, advancing and protecting our Nation's computing and networking systems is more important than ever. This legislation ensures that Federal science agencies focus on networking and information technology priorities that are in the national interest, and it provides the coordinating R&D efforts necessary to improve cyber and data security nationwide. Better network security promotes U.S. competitiveness, enhances national security, and creates high-tech jobs. The NITRD Modernization bill is an update to the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. The authorized program represents the Federal Government's main R&D portfolio for unclassified advanced networking, computing, software, cybersecurity, and related information technologies. Currently, 21 Federal agencies are contributing members of NITRD, with many additional agencies participating in the program. This bill serves as the mechanism for interagency coordination of R&D to produce a tighter focus without wasteful duplication of research efforts among Federal agencies or the private sector. This will help save taxpayers' dollars. It also rebalances agency R&D portfolios to focus less on short-term, incremental approaches and much more on large-scale, long- term interdisciplinary research to transform and enable new computing capabilities. Federal agencies are expected to invest more than $4.4 billion in fiscal year 2017 on NITRD Program activities. These investments go toward basic research at the frontiers of high-end computing, networking, and information technology. More than $1.1 billion of this is invested by the National Science Foundation and $720 million by the Department of Energy. This taxpayer-funded basic research is intended to keep the United States [[Page H3713]] the global leader in high-end computing and networking, which is crucial to our future economic and national security. The bill does this by updating and reforming the underlying High-Performance Computing statute to reflect the current mature state of our vibrant computing industry. It also codifies the NITRD National Coordination Office, housed within the National Science Foundation, to oversee the participating agencies. The NITRD Program has eight strategic priorities for its enabling research: cybersecurity, autonomous robotic systems, high-end computing and applications, exascale computing, human-computer interaction, large-scale networking, workforce development, and software design. Technologies that develop from these research priorities are used by the commercial sector and the government to protect and enhance emergency communications, the power grid, air traffic control systems, our national energy resources, scientific discovery, human exploration, new product development, and national defense systems. Advanced networking and information technology supports and boosts American discovery and innovation, improves our international competitiveness, expands the U.S. economy, and, of course, creates millions of jobs. Mr. Speaker, American job creators also recognize the importance of networking and information technology research and development. {time} 1645 Many industry partners and stakeholders have written letters in support of this bill. They include the Computing Research Association, the Computing Technology Industry Association, the Information Technology Industry Council, and the Texas A&M University System. As shown by hearings that the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology has held this Congress, including the most recent on the FDIC, cyber breaches are becoming all too commonplace. This legislation encourages agencies to increase understanding of ways to detect, prevent, and recover from actions that compromise or threaten computer- based systems. I again thank our Science, Space, and Technology Committee colleague, Representative LaHood, for his efforts on this issue, and I also commend Majority Leader McCarthy for his vision in establishing a focused innovation initiative in the House of which this legislation is a part. Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5312. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I urge a positive vote on the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk). Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding his time. Mr. Speaker, I chair the Oversight Subcommittee on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and my subcommittee has held numerous hearings on the ever-evolving threat of cyber intrusions. I also owned and operated an information technology company for more than 20 years, so I know firsthand the importance of safeguarding sensitive information and private customer data. Regrettably, as we have seen through many unfortunate examples, the American people have good reason to question whether their private information is being properly secured. That is why I am pleased to support H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. This legislation ensures that Federal science agencies focus on networking and information technology priorities that are in the national interest, and also provides the coordinated research and development efforts necessary to improve cyber and data security nationwide. The bill also encourages agencies to increase understanding of ways to detect, prevent, and recover from actions that threaten computer systems. This legislation will help stimulate innovation in the technology sector and will enable our Nation to better understand and secure its systems for the future. I thank my Science, Space, and Technology Committee colleague (Mr. LaHood) for his work on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), my colleague and friend from Illinois. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Mr. LaHood, Chairman Smith, and Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson. This is a piece of legislation that may not get a lot of publicity, but it is essential to our research capabilities and supercomputing capabilities for our future right here in this country. The United States of America needs to continue to lead in this arena. Who would have thought that while they were writing the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, it would have to be amended because of innovation that we have seen at many of our universities throughout this great country. I am obviously in support of H.R. 5312 because it is going to streamline Federal investment in high-end computing, benefiting local entities in Illinois that use advanced technologies, such as the University of Illinois in my district, Caterpillar, and Western Illinois University that is served so well by Congressman LaHood. This legislation ensures that the University of Illinois, the home to nationally recognized scientists and the Blue Waters Supercomputer, can continue to be the leader that they are in the fields of networking and computing. The National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is funded by many Federal agencies and has an impressive history of providing integrated cyber infrastructure to scientists, engineers, and scholars across the country. Addressing complex problems in today's science and society requires expertise and engagement from multiple disciplines. NCSA is committed to continuing to serve as a central hub for transdisciplinary teams to unite in making technological advancements. These important research programs are critical for coordinating Federal research and fostering revolutionary breakthroughs in computing, networking, software, and cybersecurity. By streamlining the NITRD Program, we can ensure U.S. competitiveness in advanced technologies while improving collaboration between Federal agencies, national laboratories, private industry, and academia. Mr. Speaker, this bill is an effective use of taxpayer dollars. Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letters of support mentioned by Chairman Smith, including the letter from the University of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 5312. I yield back the balance of my time. University of Illinois, Champaign, IL, June 13, 2016. Hon. Darin LaHood, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Representative LaHood: The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Urbana) is pleased to endorse H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Modernization Act of 2016. The NITRD program plays a critical role in coordinating federal investments in Information Technology (IT) research and development to better enable and equip research communities in addressing complex grand challenges in science, engineering, and society. Coordination and integration is increasingly important in the IT ecosystem. This is particularly true for high performance computing (HPC) and Big Data. At Urbana, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) serves as a world-class hub of transdisciplinary research and digital scholarship in which collaborators from across the globe unite to solve real-world problems. NCSA leads the two single largest National Science Foundation (NSF) investments in high-end computing and data analysis--the NSF Blue Waters supercomputer, the most powerful supercomputer in the academic world, and the NSF Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project, which provides collaborative and shared computing services to the HPC community. These two computing projects support thousands of researchers from across the nation whose research is funded separately by numerous federal agencies. By providing unique science capabilities, these facilities are catalyzing significant discoveries.

Re H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016 Hon. Paul D. Ryan, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,Washington, DC. Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the 60 members of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), I write to express our support for H.R. 5312, the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Modernization Act of 2016. The NITRD Program ensures the proper coordination of unclassified networking and information technology (NIT) research and development (R&D) across multiple federal agencies. More specifically, the Program aims to avoid investment redundancies, as well as increase interoperability in supercomputing, high-speed networking, cybersecurity, software engineering, and information management. However, since its inception in 1991, there have been unprecedented technological advances that are not currently addressed in the Program's overall structure. H.R. 5312 comprehensively modernizes the Program by updating essential terminology throughout the underlying law; addressing new areas of NIT research; and encouraging large-scale, long-term, interagency research in critical areas such as data analytics, social computing, human-robot interaction, privacy, and health technology. The Program plays a key role in supporting continuous federal research in various aspects related to computing, including cybersecurity. Promoting greater federal R&D in cybersecurity is essential for securing our country's digital infrastructure. Consequently, we urge you to support the NITRD Modernization Act when it comes to the floor for a vote. Sincerely, Dean C. Garfield, President and CEO. ____ Computing Research Association, Washington, DC, May 23 2016. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Ranking Member, House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Washington. DC. Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Johnson: As an organization representing over 240 industry and academic institutions involved in computing research and six affiliated professional societies, the Computing Research Association is pleased to support your efforts to bolster Federal information technology research through the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Modernization Act of 2016. As you are aware, advances in information technology are transforming all aspects of our lives. Virtually every human endeavor today has been touched by information technology, including commerce, education. employment, health care, energy, manufacturing, governance, national security, communications, the environment, entertainment, science and engineering. The profound reach of IT is enabled in large part by the innovations that spawn from the IT research ecosystem--that incredibly productive, yet complex interplay of industry, universities and the Federal government. Indeed, nearly every sub-sector of the IT economy today bears the stamp of Federal support. The program responsible for overseeing this crucial investment is the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program. We believe this Act makes the NITRD program stronger by improving the planning and coordination of the National Coordination Office for NITRD, requiring that the NCO and the NITRD agencies create a five-year strategic plan for the program, and requiring the periodic review and assessment of the program contents and funding. All have been recommendations of the President's Council of Advisors for Science and Technology in their recent reviews of the program. We thank you for your work on this legislation and for your long-standing support of the Federal investment in IT research. We look forward to working with you and your colleagues as you endeavor to move the legislation forward this session. Sincerely, Susan B.

johnson) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from illinois. general leave mr. lahood. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on h.r. 5312, the bill now under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from illinois? there was no objection. mr. lahood. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 5312, the networking and information technology research and development modernization act of 2016. first off, i would like to thank chairman lamar smith for his hard work in bringing this bill through the house science, space, and technology committee, and my colleague, ranking member eddie bernice johnson, for her leadership in introducing this bipartisan legislation with me. the networking and information technology research and development program, also known as the nitrd program, is the primary federal research and development investment portfolio in unclassified networking, computing, software, cybersecurity, and related information technologies. in my district, the nitrd program supports federal investment in research at universities like western illinois university in macomb, illinois, and the blue waters supercomputer at the university of illinois in urbana, illinois. nitrd also supports public-private partnerships between high-performance supercomputing and private [[page h3712]] corporations like, caterpillar corporation, based in peoria, illinois. information technology is all around us in our day-to-day lives--on our smartphones, in our cars, and in our homes. it improves our way of life, even in ways that are not always visible or apparent. as technology rapidly advances, the need for research and development continues to evolve. the nitrd program works to prevent duplicative and overlapping efforts in this space, thereby enabling more efficient use of government resources and taxpayer dollars, while also supporting new and innovative research and development efforts at our nation's universities and through public-private partnerships. this bill implements several important policies to help lead the way for future technological innovations and modernize the nitrd program. specifically, the bill improves the program in the following ways: first, it establishes a strategic planning and review process for the nitrd investment portfolio, with clear metrics and objectives. second, it works to improve interagency as well as government and private sector coordination and communication. third, it focuses the nitrd investment portfolio on areas of national interest and increasing importance like data analytics, privacy protection, and human-computer systems. these changes to current law will reduce bureaucracy and ensure that hardworking americans' taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and effectively. important to note, this legislation authorizes no new spending. smart investments in information technology research and development are crucial for our nation. work in related areas bolsters economic competitiveness and creates new industries and businesses; it helps ensure future national security, including cybersecurity; and creates the good-paying jobs we need for today and tomorrow. as such, i urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation to modernize nitrd and streamline federal research and development investment. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in strong support of h.r. 5312, the networking and information technology research and development modernization act of 2016. the bill before us modernizes the original high-performance computing act of 1991. in the 25 years that have passed since that bill established the framework for federal investment in computing research, networking and information technologies, nit, has transformed how we communicate with each other, how we get around, how we bank, and how we shop. nit has helped provide teachers and students in diverse communities across our nation access to resources and learning opportunities that were previously out of reach. nit has transformed every industry sector, increasing efficiency and productivity, while creating higher skilled, better paying jobs. nit made possible the decoding of the human genome and has led to myriad improvements in medical diagnostics and treatments. over these past 25 years, networking and information technologies have created opportunities across all aspects of our lives that were previously unimaginable. with those opportunities, nit has also created new challenges for individual and collective safety and security and for our privacy. our critical infrastructure, our banks, our commercial enterprises, and our own personal wallets and identities are vulnerable to criminals and state actors alike. our privacy is being compromised daily, whether we are public figures or private citizens. we cannot go back to a world before nit, nor should we. however, while investing in advancements in nit and its many applications, we must also invest in protecting our security and privacy. the networking and information technology research and development program, or nitrd, which grew out of the original 1991 high-performance computing act, does just that. the interagency nitrd program supports a full range of research and development that provides the foundation of scientific understanding and accelerates the development of advanced information technologies, while strengthening cybersecurity and privacy. the program also advances nit to accelerate discovery in many other areas of science and engineering, from astronomy to biomedical research. the legislation we are considering today, the networking and information technology research and development modernization act, continues to strengthen the management, coordination, and oversight of the nitrd program. it helps ensure that federal investments in nit r&d remain at the cutting edge and continuously evolve to include important emerging areas of nit. in addition, it encourages large-scale interdisciplinary and cross-agency collaborations in ``grand challenge'' areas of r&d. finally, the bill encourages strong collaboration and coordination with industry and other stakeholders. over time, there have been some amendments to the 1991 act. h.r. 5312, represents the committee's fourth attempt in as many congresses to enact a comprehensive modernization of the 25-year-old law. for the first time since our first effort in 2009, the senate has proposed draft language of its own. i am hopeful that we can get a nitrd modernization bill to the president's desk before year's end. given the profound implications for our economic and national security, nit is not an area of science and technology for which the u.s. can afford to cede leadership. i want to thank representative lahood, chairman smith, and committee staff for an open, collaborative, and good process which has led to a very good bill. i am pleased to be a cosponsor of the bill, and i urge my colleagues to support it. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. lahood. mr. speaker, i yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. smith), the chairman of the science, space, and technology committee. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, first of all, i want to thank the gentleman from illinois (mr. lahood) for taking the initiative on this innovation bill. and i am also pleased that the ranking member, the gentlewoman from texas (ms. eddie bernice johnson), is a cosponsor of h.r. 5312, the networking and information technology research and development modernization act of 2016. mr. speaker, in this digital age, advancing and protecting our nation's computing and networking systems is more important than ever. this legislation ensures that federal science agencies focus on networking and information technology priorities that are in the national interest, and it provides the coordinating r&d efforts necessary to improve cyber and data security nationwide. better network security promotes u.s. competitiveness, enhances national security, and creates high-tech jobs. the nitrd modernization bill is an update to the high-performance computing act of 1991. the authorized program represents the federal government's main r&d portfolio for unclassified advanced networking, computing, software, cybersecurity, and related information technologies. currently, 21 federal agencies are contributing members of nitrd, with many additional agencies participating in the program. this bill serves as the mechanism for interagency coordination of r&d to produce a tighter focus without wasteful duplication of research efforts among federal agencies or the private sector. this will help save taxpayers' dollars. it also rebalances agency r&d portfolios to focus less on short-term, incremental approaches and much more on large-scale, long- term interdisciplinary research to transform and enable new computing capabilities. federal agencies are expected to invest more than $4.4 billion in fiscal year 2017 on nitrd program activities. these investments go toward basic research at the frontiers of high-end computing, networking, and information technology. more than $1.1 billion of this is invested by the national science foundation and $720 million by the department of energy. this taxpayer-funded basic research is intended to keep the united states [[page h3713]] the global leader in high-end computing and networking, which is crucial to our future economic and national security. the bill does this by updating and reforming the underlying high-performance computing statute to reflect the current mature state of our vibrant computing industry. it also codifies the nitrd national coordination office, housed within the national science foundation, to oversee the participating agencies. the nitrd program has eight strategic priorities for its enabling research: cybersecurity, autonomous robotic systems, high-end computing and applications, exascale computing, human-computer interaction, large-scale networking, workforce development, and software design. technologies that develop from these research priorities are used by the commercial sector and the government to protect and enhance emergency communications, the power grid, air traffic control systems, our national energy resources, scientific discovery, human exploration, new product development, and national defense systems. advanced networking and information technology supports and boosts american discovery and innovation, improves our international competitiveness, expands the u.s. economy, and, of course, creates millions of jobs. mr. speaker, american job creators also recognize the importance of networking and information technology research and development. {time} 1645 many industry partners and stakeholders have written letters in support of this bill. they include the computing research association, the computing technology industry association, the information technology industry council, and the texas a&m university system. as shown by hearings that the house committee on science, space, and technology has held this congress, including the most recent on the fdic, cyber breaches are becoming all too commonplace. this legislation encourages agencies to increase understanding of ways to detect, prevent, and recover from actions that compromise or threaten computer- based systems. i again thank our science, space, and technology committee colleague, representative lahood, for his efforts on this issue, and i also commend majority leader mccarthy for his vision in establishing a focused innovation initiative in the house of which this legislation is a part. mr. speaker, again, i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 5312. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i have no further requests for time, and i urge a positive vote on the bill. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. lahood. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from georgia (mr. loudermilk). mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding his time. mr. speaker, i chair the oversight subcommittee on the science, space, and technology committee, and my subcommittee has held numerous hearings on the ever-evolving threat of cyber intrusions. i also owned and operated an information technology company for more than 20 years, so i know firsthand the importance of safeguarding sensitive information and private customer data. regrettably, as we have seen through many unfortunate examples, the american people have good reason to question whether their private information is being properly secured. that is why i am pleased to support h.r. 5312, the networking and information technology research and development modernization act of 2016. this legislation ensures that federal science agencies focus on networking and information technology priorities that are in the national interest, and also provides the coordinated research and development efforts necessary to improve cyber and data security nationwide. the bill also encourages agencies to increase understanding of ways to detect, prevent, and recover from actions that threaten computer systems. this legislation will help stimulate innovation in the technology sector and will enable our nation to better understand and secure its systems for the future. i thank my science, space, and technology committee colleague (mr. lahood) for his work on this issue, and i urge my colleagues to support the bill. mr. lahood. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. rodney davis), my colleague and friend from illinois. mr. rodney davis of illinois. mr. speaker, i thank my friend and colleague, mr. lahood, chairman smith, and ranking member eddie bernice johnson. this is a piece of legislation that may not get a lot of publicity, but it is essential to our research capabilities and supercomputing capabilities for our future right here in this country. the united states of america needs to continue to lead in this arena. who would have thought that while they were writing the high performance computing act of 1991, it would have to be amended because of innovation that we have seen at many of our universities throughout this great country. i am obviously in support of h.r. 5312 because it is going to streamline federal investment in high-end computing, benefiting local entities in illinois that use advanced technologies, such as the university of illinois in my district, caterpillar, and western illinois university that is served so well by congressman lahood. this legislation ensures that the university of illinois, the home to nationally recognized scientists and the blue waters supercomputer, can continue to be the leader that they are in the fields of networking and computing. the national center for supercomputing applications at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign is funded by many federal agencies and has an impressive history of providing integrated cyber infrastructure to scientists, engineers, and scholars across the country. addressing complex problems in today's science and society requires expertise and engagement from multiple disciplines. ncsa is committed to continuing to serve as a central hub for transdisciplinary teams to unite in making technological advancements. these important research programs are critical for coordinating federal research and fostering revolutionary breakthroughs in computing, networking, software, and cybersecurity. by streamlining the nitrd program, we can ensure u.s. competitiveness in advanced technologies while improving collaboration between federal agencies, national laboratories, private industry, and academia. mr. speaker, this bill is an effective use of taxpayer dollars. mr. lahood. mr. speaker, i include in the record the letters of support mentioned by chairman smith, including the letter from the university of illinois. mr. speaker, i urge support for h.r. 5312. i yield back the balance of my time. university of illinois, champaign, il, june 13, 2016. hon. darin lahood, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear representative lahood: the university of illinois at urbana-champaign (urbana) is pleased to endorse h.r. 5312, the networking and information technology research and development (nitrd) modernization act of 2016. the nitrd program plays a critical role in coordinating federal investments in information technology (it) research and development to better enable and equip research communities in addressing complex grand challenges in science, engineering, and society. coordination and integration is increasingly important in the it ecosystem. this is particularly true for high performance computing (hpc) and big data. at urbana, the national center for supercomputing applications (ncsa) serves as a

addressing new areas of nit research; and encouraging large-scale, long-term, interagency research in critical areas such as data analytics, social computing, human-robot interaction, privacy, and health technology. the program plays a key role in supporting continuous federal research in various aspects related to computing, including cybersecurity. promoting greater federal r&d in cybersecurity is essential for securing our country's digital infrastructure. consequently, we urge you to support the nitrd modernization act when it comes to the floor for a vote. sincerely, dean c. garfield, president and ceo. ____ computing research association, washington, dc, may 23 2016. hon. lamar smith, chairman, house science, space, and technology committee, washington, dc. hon. eddie bernice johnson, ranking member, house science, space, and technology committee, washington. dc. chairman smith, ranking member johnson: as an organization representing over 240 industry and academic institutions involved in computing research and six affiliated professional societies, the computing research association is pleased to support your efforts to bolster federal information technology research through the networking and information technology research and development modernization act of 2016. as you are aware, advances in information technology are transforming all aspects of our lives. virtually every human endeavor today has been touched by information technology, including commerce, education. employment, health care, energy, manufacturing, governance, national security, communications, the environment, entertainment, science and engineering. the profound reach of it is enabled in large part by the innovations that spawn from the it research ecosystem--that incredibly productive, yet complex interplay of industry, universities and the federal government. indeed, nearly every sub-sector of the it economy today bears the stamp of federal support. the program responsible for overseeing this crucial investment is the networking and information technology research and development (nitrd) program. we believe this act makes the nitrd program stronger by improving the planning and coordination of the national coordination office for nitrd, requiring that the nco and the nitrd agencies create a five-year strategic plan for the program, and requiring the periodic review and assessment of the program contents and funding. all have been recommendations of the president's council of advisors for science and technology in their recent reviews of the program. we thank you for your work on this legislation and for your long-standing support of the federal investment in it research. we look forward to working with you and your colleagues as you endeavor to move the legislation forward this session. sincerely, susan b. davidson, chair, board of directors. ____ comptia, washington, dc, june 13, 2016. chris shank, policy and coalitions director, house science, space, and technology committee, washington, dc. chris: thank you for providing comptia the opportunity to lend our support to the networking and information technology research and development (nitrd) modernization act of 2016 (h.r. 5312). as stated on the nitrd website, ``the multiagency nitrd program seeks to provide the research and development (r&d) foundations for assuring continued u.s. technological leadership and meeting the needs of the federal government for advanced information technologies.'' comptia strongly supports the act as it assures that nitrd continues to receive the funding necessary to help drive innovation through the scientific community. comptia also supports the development of a national coordination office to ensure improved communication within the nitrd ecosystem. finally, comptia supports the focus on grand challenges that correlates with the nitrd portfolio. best regards, david logsdon, senior director, public advocacy. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from illinois (mr. lahood) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 5312, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. lahood. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",54703
CREC-2016-06-13-pt1-PgH3721,CREC-2016-06-13,114,STRATEGY TO OPPOSE PREDATORY ORGAN TRAFFICKING ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3721-H3724] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STRATEGY TO OPPOSE PREDATORY ORGAN TRAFFICKING ACT Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3694) to combat trafficking in human organs, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3694 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Strategy To Oppose Predatory Organ Trafficking Act'' or the ``STOP Organ Trafficking Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 10 percent of all transplanted kidneys worldwide are illegally obtained, often bought from vulnerable impoverished persons or forcibly harvested from prisoners. (2) In 2004, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution urging its member-states to take measures to protect the poorest as well as vulnerable groups from exploitation by organ traffickers. (3) On February 13, 2008, the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UNGIFT) hosted the ``Vienna Forum to Fight Human Trafficking'', and subsequently reported that a lack of adequate illicit organ trafficking laws has provided opportunity for the illegal trade to grow. (4) On March 21, 2011, the Council of the European Union adopted rules supplementing the definition of criminal offenses and the level of sanctions in order to strengthen the prevention of organ trafficking and the protection of those victims. (5) In 2005, the United States ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women [[Page H3722]] and Children, a supplement to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which includes the removal of organs as a form of exploitation under the definition of ``trafficking in persons''. (6) According to a 2013 United Nations report from the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the economic and social divisions within and among countries is notably reflected in the illicit organ trafficking market, in which the victims are commonly poor, unemployed, and more susceptible to deceit and extortion. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the kidnapping or coercion of individuals for the purpose of extracting their organs for profit is in contradiction of the ideals and standards for ethical behavior upon which the United States has based its laws; (2) the illegal harvesting of organs from children is a violation of the human rights of the child and is a breach of internationally accepted medical ethical standards described in WHO Assembly Resolution 57.18 (May 22, 2004); (3) the illegal harvesting and trafficking of organs violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in Article 3 which states that ``Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.'', and in Article 4 which states that ``No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.''; and (4) establishing efficient voluntary organ donation systems with strong enforcement mechanisms is the most effective way to combat trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs. SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. It shall be the policy of the United States to-- (1) combat the international trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs; (2) promote the establishment of voluntary organ donation systems with effective enforcement mechanisms in bilateral diplomatic meetings, as well as in international health forums; and (3) promote the dignity and security of human life in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. SEC. 5. REVOCATION OR DENIAL OF PASSPORTS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ORGAN TRAFFICKERS. The Act entitled ``An Act to regulate the issue and validity of passports, and for other purposes'', approved July 3, 1926 (22 U.S.C. 211a et seq.), which is commonly known as the ``Passport Act of 1926'', is amended by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO DENY OR REVOKE PASSPORT. ``(a) Issuance.--The Secretary of State may refuse to issue a passport to any individual who has been convicted of an offense under section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act (42 U.S.C. 274e) if such individual used a passport or otherwise crossed an international border in the commission of such an offence. ``(b) Revocation.--The Secretary of State may revoke a passport previously issued to any individual described in paragraph (1).''. SEC. 6. AMENDMENTS TO THE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT OF 2000.

SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act: (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate. (2) Organ.--The term ``organ'' has the meaning given the term ``human organ'' in section 301(c)(1) of the National Organ Transplant Act (42 U.S.C. 274e(c)(1)).

SEC. 9. LIMITATION ON FUNDS. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act or any amendment made by this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch for introducing this important bill. The concept here is to combat the horrific crime of human trafficking for organ removal. And, as always, I appreciate the support of the ranking member, Mr. Eliot Engel, in moving this antitrafficking bill forward. As hard as it is for us to accept this, as shocking as this is, the circumstances are such that rising global demand and a lack of adequate laws in many countries has fueled the growth of a worldwide black market for transplant organs. The World Health Organization estimates that 10 percent of all transplanted organs worldwide are illegally obtained. That would mean that they were being coerced from vulnerable populations or forcibly harvested from prisoners. Often these prisoners are shot first in order to obtain organs, such as hearts, corneas, or lungs. They [[Page H3723]] are taken from hostages. They are taken from oppressed minorities. An example would be kidneys or part of a liver. These abuses are more than just grave human rights violations. They also have worldwide implications for national security and public health. What do we mean when we say implications for national security? Well, criminal organizations and terrorist groups are increasingly engaging in this black market industry that is valued now at a billion dollars. To give you some of the most extreme examples: ISIS recently issued a fatwa sanctioning forced organ harvesting from captives and, as they call them, from apostates; and traffickers smuggling refugees into Europe have reportedly coerced organ donations, coerced a kidney as payment for travel. A number of studies have underscored how this shady commerce also creates biosecurity threats to the rest of the world. Recipients of infected tissue or organs may become human carriers of disease. Or another problem is drug-resistant pathogens that contribute to the spread of pandemics and antibiotic resistance. Now, the U.S. has led the fight against human trafficking, and I would add, with help from the Foreign Affairs Committee, with help from the legislation that we, our members on the committee, have authored. This bill continues and expands that effort, and it does so by closing the gap in U.S. law that currently fails to recognize the trafficking in persons for the removal of their organs as a form of human trafficking. Specifically, this bill also makes it the policy of the United States to combat such trafficking, to promote the adoption of effective voluntary organ donation systems in bilateral engagements and multinational health forums that we have with other countries. And it requires an annual report to Congress, an annual report on human trafficking for organ removal, which details activities by our State Department and by other countries to combat this crime. Finally, the bill allows for the revocation of passports from any individual that is involved in this kind of activity, that is convicted of an organ trafficking offense under the National Organ Transplant Act, as well as permitting the denial of visas to applicants with such convictions. So I urge all Members to support this important measure. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Before I begin, this is the first time I have spoken on the House floor since the horrific attack in Orlando, and I just want to take a brief moment to talk about it. This was a shocking hate crime against the LGBT community, a jarring and disgusting attack on our LGBT brothers and sisters, and on the progress LGBT rights have made in this country. And, of course, this was also a terrorist attack, and we need to look at it in the broader context of how we're working to meet the challenge of violent extremism here and around the world. Mr. Speaker, since yesterday morning, there has been an outpouring of thoughts and prayers for the victims in Orlando and their loved ones; and, to be sure, moral and spiritual support are a part of how we grieve and heal. We are all angry about this heinous attack. We are all heartbroken. We are all committed to finding answers. We are all standing together, and we will move forward from this tragedy together. But, as lawmakers, we are empowered to do more than think and pray. In fact, we are certainly empowered to do more. I certainly have my views on what is necessary on the domestic side to stop this slaughter by gun violence, but I will leave that contentious debate aside for the moment. What I will say is that, on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Republicans and Democrats have found a great deal of common ground on what sort of measures will help to keep us safe and to confront the threat of violent extremism. What has guided us in the past: the spirit of nonpartisanship and the belief that politics should stop at the water's edge, should continue to inform our work. Turning to this bill, let me thank the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce; and I want to thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch for all of their hard work on this measure. The World Health Organization estimates that 10 percent of all transplanted organs worldwide are illegally obtained. That is an alarming number; but, like so many illegal enterprises, this is a crime that is poorly understood, that seeks out zones of impunity where the light of the law doesn't shine and where information is hard to come by. So with a handful of estimates and reports, we are left asking: Who are the victims of this crime? How do they become trapped by this illegal trade? What pressures and vulnerabilities made them susceptible? What are governments doing to halt the practice to track down those responsible and to provide services to survivors? Should this challenge be included in our efforts to confront modern slavery, or is this a different sort of problem altogether? This bill will help us get answers to these questions. It calls for a report on this crime that will allow us to connect the dots. Once we know what we are dealing with, then we can figure out the best way to act and chart a path forward. So I am glad to support it. I thank the chairman and the bill's sponsors again. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Trott), who is the author of this bill. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, the committee staff, and Mena Hanna from my office for their work on H.R. 3694. I also want to thank my colleague, Representative Deutch, for coauthoring the STOP Organ Trafficking Act with me. Illegal trafficking of human organs has long been a terrible and heinous crime, but unfortunately our policies and laws have not kept pace with this outrageous practice. China has been inexplicably targeting the Falun Gong for years, and more recently, ISIS has reportedly been resorting to this brutal practice to finance their nefarious activities and strike fear in the hearts of innocent people. Late last year, ISIS released a religious edict stating that taking organs from a living captive to save a Muslim's life was permissible, making religious minorities all over the Middle East, like the Chaldeans and the Assyrians, even more vulnerable. Other helpless groups of people, like refugees, have reportedly been selling their organs on the black market through dealers who then sell the organs to foreign countries in what is quickly becoming an unchecked and lucrative business. Mr. Speaker, it is time for the United States to take a leading role in combatting this heinous crime and standing with the world's most vulnerable. We must ensure that our country is doing everything within our power to destroy any revenue stream that ISIS relies on to further its terrorist activities. My bill is a start to this lengthy process, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this timely legislation. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). {time} 1745 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce again for bringing this important bill to the floor, and to Eliot Engel for his leadership and Mr. Deutch, and especially to Mr. Trott, the sponsor of H.R. 3694, the Strategy To Oppose Predatory Organ Trafficking Act. This legislation recognizes and seeks to more effectively combat what is a growing manifestation of trafficking in persons for the sole purpose of organ removal, often for great profit for the traffickers. Mr. Trott's legislation requires the Department of State to develop a robust strategy to combat this heinous practice. We have long heard rumors and horror stories of migrants held captive in sub-Saharan Africa and the Sinai Peninsula, their organs taken [[Page H3724]] and their bodies dumped because their families could not afford the ransom. Twenty years ago, I chaired a human rights hearing in my subcommittee with a Chinese security official who testified that he and his other security agents were executing prisoners--with doctors, of course, there and ambulances--in order to steal their organs for transplant. Since then, this horrific practice has skyrocketed. Recent evidence from researchers Ethan Gutmann and David Matas shows that organ transplants in China have increased almost exponentially, not decreased. There is a bizarre availability of organs in Chinese military hospitals and China's transplant apparatus that can often issue a tissue match and find an organ transplant within 2 weeks for any foreign tourist with cash. This initiative by Mr. Trott will require the State Department to do a more thorough analysis of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal in China and elsewhere around the world, informing a strategy to stop this crime against humanity. Any American, Mr. Speaker, traveling to China for an organ transplant in 2016 should now be on notice that they may be participating in human trafficking of a vulnerable person or of a prisoner. Americans must not turn a blind eye to the ambiguous origins of a proffered organ. H.R. 3694 will help ensure that Americans are certain that they are receiving transplants only in countries that prohibit and actively suppress organ harvesting from trafficking victims. I thank the gentleman for his legislation. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, the United States has made tremendous progress shining a light on poorly understood problems around the world and working to find solutions: human trafficking, the advancement of women and girls, the importance of protecting our oceans, and combating climate change. A generation ago, no one considered these foreign policy issues, but today we are prioritizing every single one of them. That is what we are trying to do now with respect to organ trafficking. This legislation will give us a fuller understanding of this problem so that we can act in the most effective way possible. This is, again, a great bipartisan measure. I thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch and Chairman Royce. I am happy to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The scourge of illegal organ trafficking has been pretty well documented, and you heard, here, Congressman David Trott explain the fatwa that has now been put out by ISIS that not only excuses the effort to go after Yazidis and Christians and others that they call apostates, but all captives are open to losing a kidney or forced organ transplant. The intention here is to make a market in this in the Middle East. But it does not just occur there, within the boundaries of ISIS' caliphate. This is a crime that reportedly occurs in some 20 countries, in all regions of the world. So I thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch for introducing this legislation. I also thank Mr. Engel, and I want to commend Sarah Blocher of the Committee on Foreign Affairs professional staff for years of excellent work on this issue and her assistance to the authors. The STOP Organ Trafficking Act addresses a critical challenge to human rights, to our national security, to our public health, and it deserves our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3694, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3721-H3724] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STRATEGY TO OPPOSE PREDATORY ORGAN TRAFFICKING ACT Mr. ROYCE.

SEC. 9. LIMITATION ON FUNDS. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act or any amendment made by this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch for introducing this important bill. The concept here is to combat the horrific crime of human trafficking for organ removal. And, as always, I appreciate the support of the ranking member, Mr. Eliot Engel, in moving this antitrafficking bill forward. As hard as it is for us to accept this, as shocking as this is, the circumstances are such that rising global demand and a lack of adequate laws in many countries has fueled the growth of a worldwide black market for transplant organs. The World Health Organization estimates that 10 percent of all transplanted organs worldwide are illegally obtained. That would mean that they were being coerced from vulnerable populations or forcibly harvested from prisoners. Often these prisoners are shot first in order to obtain organs, such as hearts, corneas, or lungs. They [[Page H3723]] are taken from hostages. They are taken from oppressed minorities. An example would be kidneys or part of a liver. These abuses are more than just grave human rights violations. They also have worldwide implications for national security and public health. What do we mean when we say implications for national security? Well, criminal organizations and terrorist groups are increasingly engaging in this black market industry that is valued now at a billion dollars. To give you some of the most extreme examples: ISIS recently issued a fatwa sanctioning forced organ harvesting from captives and, as they call them, from apostates; and traffickers smuggling refugees into Europe have reportedly coerced organ donations, coerced a kidney as payment for travel. A number of studies have underscored how this shady commerce also creates biosecurity threats to the rest of the world. Recipients of infected tissue or organs may become human carriers of disease. Or another problem is drug-resistant pathogens that contribute to the spread of pandemics and antibiotic resistance. Now, the U.S. has led the fight against human trafficking, and I would add, with help from the Foreign Affairs Committee, with help from the legislation that we, our members on the committee, have authored. This bill continues and expands that effort, and it does so by closing the gap in U.S. law that currently fails to recognize the trafficking in persons for the removal of their organs as a form of human trafficking. Specifically, this bill also makes it the policy of the United States to combat such trafficking, to promote the adoption of effective voluntary organ donation systems in bilateral engagements and multinational health forums that we have with other countries. And it requires an annual report to Congress, an annual report on human trafficking for organ removal, which details activities by our State Department and by other countries to combat this crime. Finally, the bill allows for the revocation of passports from any individual that is involved in this kind of activity, that is convicted of an organ trafficking offense under the National Organ Transplant Act, as well as permitting the denial of visas to applicants with such convictions. So I urge all Members to support this important measure. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Before I begin, this is the first time I have spoken on the House floor since the horrific attack in Orlando, and I just want to take a brief moment to talk about it. This was a shocking hate crime against the LGBT community, a jarring and disgusting attack on our LGBT brothers and sisters, and on the progress LGBT rights have made in this country. And, of course, this was also a terrorist attack, and we need to look at it in the broader context of how we're working to meet the challenge of violent extremism here and around the world. Mr. Speaker, since yesterday morning, there has been an outpouring of thoughts and prayers for the victims in Orlando and their loved ones; and, to be sure, moral and spiritual support are a part of how we grieve and heal. We are all angry about this heinous attack. We are all heartbroken. We are all committed to finding answers. We are all standing together, and we will move forward from this tragedy together. But, as lawmakers, we are empowered to do more than think and pray. In fact, we are certainly empowered to do more. I certainly have my views on what is necessary on the domestic side to stop this slaughter by gun violence, but I will leave that contentious debate aside for the moment. What I will say is that, on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Republicans and Democrats have found a great deal of common ground on what sort of measures will help to keep us safe and to confront the threat of violent extremism. What has guided us in the past: the spirit of nonpartisanship and the belief that politics should stop at the water's edge, should continue to inform our work. Turning to this bill, let me thank the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce; and I want to thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch for all of their hard work on this measure. The World Health Organization estimates that 10 percent of all transplanted organs worldwide are illegally obtained. That is an alarming number; but, like so many illegal enterprises, this is a crime that is poorly understood, that seeks out zones of impunity where the light of the law doesn't shine and where information is hard to come by. So with a handful of estimates and reports, we are left asking: Who are the victims of this crime? How do they become trapped by this illegal trade? What pressures and vulnerabilities made them susceptible? What are governments doing to halt the practice to track down those responsible and to provide services to survivors? Should this challenge be included in our efforts to confront modern slavery, or is this a different sort of problem altogether? This bill will help us get answers to these questions. It calls for a report on this crime that will allow us to connect the dots. Once we know what we are dealing with, then we can figure out the best way to act and chart a path forward. So I am glad to support it. I thank the chairman and the bill's sponsors again. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Trott), who is the author of this bill. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, the committee staff, and Mena Hanna from my office for their work on H.R. 3694. I also want to thank my colleague, Representative Deutch, for coauthoring the STOP Organ Trafficking Act with me. Illegal trafficking of human organs has long been a terrible and heinous crime, but unfortunately our policies and laws have not kept pace with this outrageous practice. China has been inexplicably targeting the Falun Gong for years, and more recently, ISIS has reportedly been resorting to this brutal practice to finance their nefarious activities and strike fear in the hearts of innocent people. Late last year, ISIS released a religious edict stating that taking organs from a living captive to save a Muslim's life was permissible, making religious minorities all over the Middle East, like the Chaldeans and the Assyrians, even more vulnerable. Other helpless groups of people, like refugees, have reportedly been selling their organs on the black market through dealers who then sell the organs to foreign countries in what is quickly becoming an unchecked and lucrative business. Mr. Speaker, it is time for the United States to take a leading role in combatting this heinous crime and standing with the world's most vulnerable. We must ensure that our country is doing everything within our power to destroy any revenue stream that ISIS relies on to further its terrorist activities. My bill is a start to this lengthy process, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this timely legislation. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). {time} 1745 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce again for bringing this important bill to the floor, and to Eliot Engel for his leadership and Mr. Deutch, and especially to Mr. Trott, the sponsor of H.R. 3694, the Strategy To Oppose Predatory Organ Trafficking Act. This legislation recognizes and seeks to more effectively combat what is a growing manifestation of trafficking in persons for the sole purpose of organ removal, often for great profit for the traffickers. Mr. Trott's legislation requires the Department of State to develop a robust strategy to combat this heinous practice. We have long heard rumors and horror stories of migrants held captive in sub-Saharan Africa and the Sinai Peninsula, their organs taken [[Page H3724]] and their bodies dumped because their families could not afford the ransom. Twenty years ago, I chaired a human rights hearing in my subcommittee with a Chinese security official who testified that he and his other security agents were executing prisoners--with doctors, of course, there and ambulances--in order to steal their organs for transplant. Since then, this horrific practice has skyrocketed. Recent evidence from researchers Ethan Gutmann and David Matas shows that organ transplants in China have increased almost exponentially, not decreased. There is a bizarre availability of organs in Chinese military hospitals and China's transplant apparatus that can often issue a tissue match and find an organ transplant within 2 weeks for any foreign tourist with cash. This initiative by Mr. Trott will require the State Department to do a more thorough analysis of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal in China and elsewhere around the world, informing a strategy to stop this crime against humanity. Any American, Mr. Speaker, traveling to China for an organ transplant in 2016 should now be on notice that they may be participating in human trafficking of a vulnerable person or of a prisoner. Americans must not turn a blind eye to the ambiguous origins of a proffered organ. H.R. 3694 will help ensure that Americans are certain that they are receiving transplants only in countries that prohibit and actively suppress organ harvesting from trafficking victims. I thank the gentleman for his legislation. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, the United States has made tremendous progress shining a light on poorly understood problems around the world and working to find solutions: human trafficking, the advancement of women and girls, the importance of protecting our oceans, and combating climate change. A generation ago, no one considered these foreign policy issues, but today we are prioritizing every single one of them. That is what we are trying to do now with respect to organ trafficking. This legislation will give us a fuller understanding of this problem so that we can act in the most effective way possible. This is, again, a great bipartisan measure. I thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch and Chairman Royce. I am happy to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The scourge of illegal organ trafficking has been pretty well documented, and you heard, here, Congressman David Trott explain the fatwa that has now been put out by ISIS that not only excuses the effort to go after Yazidis and Christians and others that they call apostates, but all captives are open to losing a kidney or forced organ transplant. The intention here is to make a market in this in the Middle East. But it does not just occur there, within the boundaries of ISIS' caliphate. This is a crime that reportedly occurs in some 20 countries, in all regions of the world. So I thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch for introducing this legislation. I also thank Mr. Engel, and I want to commend Sarah Blocher of the Committee on Foreign Affairs professional staff for years of excellent work on this issue and her assistance to the authors. The STOP Organ Trafficking Act addresses a critical challenge to human rights, to our national security, to our public health, and it deserves our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3694, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3721-H3724] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STRATEGY TO OPPOSE PREDATORY ORGAN TRAFFICKING ACT Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3694) to combat trafficking in human organs, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3694 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Strategy To Oppose Predatory Organ Trafficking Act'' or the ``STOP Organ Trafficking Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 10 percent of all transplanted kidneys worldwide are illegally obtained, often bought from vulnerable impoverished persons or forcibly harvested from prisoners. (2) In 2004, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution urging its member-states to take measures to protect the poorest as well as vulnerable groups from exploitation by organ traffickers. (3) On February 13, 2008, the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UNGIFT) hosted the ``Vienna Forum to Fight Human Trafficking'', and subsequently reported that a lack of adequate illicit organ trafficking laws has provided opportunity for the illegal trade to grow. (4) On March 21, 2011, the Council of the European Union adopted rules supplementing the definition of criminal offenses and the level of sanctions in order to strengthen the prevention of organ trafficking and the protection of those victims. (5) In 2005, the United States ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women [[Page H3722]] and Children, a supplement to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which includes the removal of organs as a form of exploitation under the definition of ``trafficking in persons''. (6) According to a 2013 United Nations report from the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the economic and social divisions within and among countries is notably reflected in the illicit organ trafficking market, in which the victims are commonly poor, unemployed, and more susceptible to deceit and extortion. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the kidnapping or coercion of individuals for the purpose of extracting their organs for profit is in contradiction of the ideals and standards for ethical behavior upon which the United States has based its laws; (2) the illegal harvesting of organs from children is a violation of the human rights of the child and is a breach of internationally accepted medical ethical standards described in WHO Assembly Resolution 57.18 (May 22, 2004); (3) the illegal harvesting and trafficking of organs violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in Article 3 which states that ``Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.'', and in Article 4 which states that ``No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.''; and (4) establishing efficient voluntary organ donation systems with strong enforcement mechanisms is the most effective way to combat trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs. SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. It shall be the policy of the United States to-- (1) combat the international trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs; (2) promote the establishment of voluntary organ donation systems with effective enforcement mechanisms in bilateral diplomatic meetings, as well as in international health forums; and (3) promote the dignity and security of human life in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. SEC. 5. REVOCATION OR DENIAL OF PASSPORTS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ORGAN TRAFFICKERS. The Act entitled ``An Act to regulate the issue and validity of passports, and for other purposes'', approved July 3, 1926 (22 U.S.C. 211a et seq.), which is commonly known as the ``Passport Act of 1926'', is amended by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO DENY OR REVOKE PASSPORT. ``(a) Issuance.--The Secretary of State may refuse to issue a passport to any individual who has been convicted of an offense under section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act (42 U.S.C. 274e) if such individual used a passport or otherwise crossed an international border in the commission of such an offence. ``(b) Revocation.--The Secretary of State may revoke a passport previously issued to any individual described in paragraph (1).''. SEC. 6. AMENDMENTS TO THE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT OF 2000. (a) Definitions.--Section 103 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (9)-- (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``or'' at the end; (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end and inserting: ``; or''; and (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(C) trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs (as defined in paragraph (13)).''; (2) by redesignating paragraphs (13) through (15) as paragraphs (14) through (16), respectively; and (3) by inserting after paragraph (12) the following new paragraph: ``(13) Trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs.-- ``(A) In general.--The term `trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs' means the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of a person, either living or deceased, for the purpose of removing one or more of the person's organs, by means of-- ``(i) coercion; ``(ii) abduction; ``(iii) deception; ``(iv) fraud; ``(v) abuse of power or a position of vulnerability; or ``(vi) transfer of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over a person described in the matter preceding clause (i). ``(B) Organ defined.--In subparagraph (A), the term `organ' has the meaning given the term `human organ' in section 301(c)(1) of the National Organ Transplant Act (42 U.S.C. 274e(c)(1)).''. (b) Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking.--Section 105(d)(3) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7103(d)(3)) is amended by inserting after the first sentence the following new sentence: ``Such procedures shall include collection and organization of data from human rights officers at United States embassies on host country's laws against trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs and any instances of violations of such laws.''. SEC. 7. REPORTING. (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter through 2024, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a comprehensive report that includes the following information: (1) A description of the sources, practices, methods, facilitators, and recipients of trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs during the period covered by each such report.

(3) A description of activities undertaken by countries to address and prevent trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs. (b) Matters to Be Included.--The reports required under subsection (a) shall include the collection and organization of data from human rights officers at United States diplomatic and consular posts on host countries' laws against trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs, including enforcement of such laws, or any instances of violations of such laws. (c) Additional Matters to Be Included.--The reports required under subsection (a) may include-- (1) information provided in meetings with host country officials; (2) information provided through cooperation with United Nations or World Health Organization agencies; (3) communications and reports provided by nongovernmental organizations working on the issue of trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs; and (4) any other reports or information sources the Secretary of State determines to be necessary and appropriate. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act: (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate. (2) Organ.--The term ``organ'' has the meaning given the term ``human organ'' in section 301(c)(1) of the National Organ Transplant Act (42 U.S.C. 274e(c)(1)). (3) Trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs.--The term ``trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs'' means the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of a person, either living or deceased, for the purpose of removing one or more of the person's organs, by means of-- (A) coercion; (B) abduction; (C) deception; (D) fraud; (E) abuse of power or a position of vulnerability; or (F) transfer of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over a person described in the matter preceding clause (i). SEC. 9. LIMITATION ON FUNDS. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act or any amendment made by this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch for introducing this important bill. The concept here is to combat the horrific crime of human trafficking for organ removal. And, as always, I appreciate the support of the ranking member, Mr. Eliot Engel, in moving this antitrafficking bill forward. As hard as it is for us to accept this, as shocking as this is, the circumstances are such that rising global demand and a lack of adequate laws in many countries has fueled the growth of a worldwide black market for transplant organs.

Often these prisoners are shot first in order to obtain organs, such as hearts, corneas, or lungs. They [[Page H3723]] are taken from hostages. They are taken from oppressed minorities. An example would be kidneys or part of a liver. These abuses are more than just grave human rights violations. They also have worldwide implications for national security and public health. What do we mean when we say implications for national security? Well, criminal organizations and terrorist groups are increasingly engaging in this black market industry that is valued now at a billion dollars.

Finally, the bill allows for the revocation of passports from any individual that is involved in this kind of activity, that is convicted of an organ trafficking offense under the National Organ Transplant Act, as well as permitting the denial of visas to applicants with such convictions. So I urge all Members to support this important measure. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Before I begin, this is the first time I have spoken on the House floor since the horrific attack in Orlando, and I just want to take a brief moment to talk about it. This was a shocking hate crime against the LGBT community, a jarring and disgusting attack on our LGBT brothers and sisters, and on the progress LGBT rights have made in this country. And, of course, this was also a terrorist attack, and we need to look at it in the broader context of how we're working to meet the challenge of violent extremism here and around the world. Mr. Speaker, since yesterday morning, there has been an outpouring of thoughts and prayers for the victims in Orlando and their loved ones; and, to be sure, moral and spiritual support are a part of how we grieve and heal. We are all angry about this heinous attack. We are all heartbroken. We are all committed to finding answers. We are all standing together, and we will move forward from this tragedy together. But, as lawmakers, we are empowered to do more than think and pray. In fact, we are certainly empowered to do more. I certainly have my views on what is necessary on the domestic side to stop this slaughter by gun violence, but I will leave that contentious debate aside for the moment. What I will say is that, on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Republicans and Democrats have found a great deal of common ground on what sort of measures will help to keep us safe and to confront the threat of violent extremism. What has guided us in the past: the spirit of nonpartisanship and the belief that politics should stop at the water's edge, should continue to inform our work. Turning to this bill, let me thank the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce; and I want to thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch for all of their hard work on this measure. The World Health Organization estimates that 10 percent of all transplanted organs worldwide are illegally obtained. That is an alarming number; but, like so many illegal enterprises, this is a crime that is poorly understood, that seeks out zones of impunity where the light of the law doesn't shine and where information is hard to come by. So with a handful of estimates and reports, we are left asking: Who are the victims of this crime? How do they become trapped by this illegal trade? What pressures and vulnerabilities made them susceptible? What are governments doing to halt the practice to track down those responsible and to provide services to survivors? Should this challenge be included in our efforts to confront modern slavery, or is this a different sort of problem altogether? This bill will help us get answers to these questions. It calls for a report on this crime that will allow us to connect the dots. Once we know what we are dealing with, then we can figure out the best way to act and chart a path forward. So I am glad to support it. I thank the chairman and the bill's sponsors again. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Trott), who is the author of this bill. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, the committee staff, and Mena Hanna from my office for their work on H.R. 3694. I also want to thank my colleague, Representative Deutch, for coauthoring the STOP Organ Trafficking Act with me. Illegal trafficking of human organs has long been a terrible and heinous crime, but unfortunately our policies and laws have not kept pace with this outrageous practice. China has been inexplicably targeting the Falun Gong for years, and more recently, ISIS has reportedly been resorting to this brutal practice to finance their nefarious activities and strike fear in the hearts of innocent people. Late last year, ISIS released a religious edict stating that taking organs from a living captive to save a Muslim's life was permissible, making religious minorities all over the Middle East, like the Chaldeans and the Assyrians, even more vulnerable. Other helpless groups of people, like refugees, have reportedly been selling their organs on the black market through dealers who then sell the organs to foreign countries in what is quickly becoming an unchecked and lucrative business. Mr. Speaker, it is time for the United States to take a leading role in combatting this heinous crime and standing with the world's most vulnerable. We must ensure that our country is doing everything within our power to destroy any revenue stream that ISIS relies on to further its terrorist activities. My bill is a start to this lengthy process, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this timely legislation. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). {time} 1745 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce again for bringing this important bill to the floor, and to Eliot Engel for his leadership and Mr. Deutch, and especially to Mr. Trott, the sponsor of H.R. 3694, the Strategy To Oppose Predatory Organ Trafficking Act. This legislation recognizes and seeks to more effectively combat what is a growing manifestation of trafficking in persons for the sole purpose of organ removal, often for great profit for the traffickers. Mr. Trott's legislation requires the Department of State to develop a robust strategy to combat this heinous practice. We have long heard rumors and horror stories of migrants held captive in sub-Saharan Africa and the Sinai Peninsula, their organs taken [[Page H3724]] and their bodies dumped because their families could not afford the ransom. Twenty years ago, I chaired a human rights hearing in my subcommittee with a Chinese security official who testified that he and his other security agents were executing prisoners--with doctors, of course, there and ambulances--in order to steal their organs for transplant. Since then, this horrific practice has skyrocketed. Recent evidence from researchers Ethan Gutmann and David Matas shows that organ transplants in China have increased almost exponentially, not decreased. There is a bizarre availability of organs in Chinese military hospitals and China's transplant apparatus that can often issue a tissue match and find an organ transplant within 2 weeks for any foreign tourist with cash. This initiative by Mr. Trott will require the State Department to do a more thorough analysis of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal in China and elsewhere around the world, informing a strategy to stop this crime against humanity. Any American, Mr. Speaker, traveling to China for an organ transplant in 2016 should now be on notice that they may be participating in human trafficking of a vulnerable person or of a prisoner. Americans must not turn a blind eye to the ambiguous origins of a proffered organ. H.R. 3694 will help ensure that Americans are certain that they are receiving transplants only in countries that prohibit and actively suppress organ harvesting from trafficking victims. I thank the gentleman for his legislation. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, the United States has made tremendous progress shining a light on poorly understood problems around the world and working to find solutions: human trafficking, the advancement of women and girls, the importance of protecting our oceans, and combating climate change. A generation ago, no one considered these foreign policy issues, but today we are prioritizing every single one of them. That is what we are trying to do now with respect to organ trafficking. This legislation will give us a fuller understanding of this problem so that we can act in the most effective way possible. This is, again, a great bipartisan measure. I thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch and Chairman Royce. I am happy to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The scourge of illegal organ trafficking has been pretty well documented, and you heard, here, Congressman David Trott explain the fatwa that has now been put out by ISIS that not only excuses the effort to go after Yazidis and Christians and others that they call apostates, but all captives are open to losing a kidney or forced organ transplant. The intention here is to make a market in this in the Middle East. But it does not just occur there, within the boundaries of ISIS' caliphate. This is a crime that reportedly occurs in some 20 countries, in all regions of the world. So I thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch for introducing this legislation. I also thank Mr. Engel, and I want to commend Sarah Blocher of the Committee on Foreign Affairs professional staff for years of excellent work on this issue and her assistance to the authors. The STOP Organ Trafficking Act addresses a critical challenge to human rights, to our national security, to our public health, and it deserves our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3694, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_183.csv,22978,22978,23044,"[congressional record volume 162, number 93 (monday, june 13, 2016)] [house] [pages h3721-h3724] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] strategy to oppose predatory organ trafficking act mr. royce. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 3694) to combat trafficking in human organs, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 3694 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``strategy to oppose predatory organ trafficking act'' or the ``stop organ trafficking act''. sec. 2. findings. congress finds the following: (1) the world health organization (who) estimates that approximately 10 percent of all transplanted kidneys worldwide are illegally obtained, often bought from vulnerable impoverished persons or forcibly harvested from prisoners. (2) in 2004, the world health assembly passed a resolution urging its member-states to take measures to protect the poorest as well as vulnerable groups from exploitation by organ traffickers. (3) on february 13, 2008, the united nations global initiative to fight human trafficking (ungift) hosted the ``vienna forum to fight human trafficking'', and subsequently reported that a lack of adequate illicit organ trafficking laws has provided opportunity for the illegal trade to grow. (4) on march 21, 2011, the council of the european union adopted rules supplementing the definition of criminal offenses and the level of sanctions in order to strengthen the prevention of organ trafficking and the protection of those victims. (5) in 2005, the united states ratified the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women [[page h3722]] and children, a supplement to the united nations convention against transnational organized crime, which includes the removal of organs as a form of exploitation under the definition of ``trafficking in persons''. (6) according to a 2013 united nations report from the special rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the economic and social divisions within and among countries is notably reflected in the illicit organ trafficking market, in which the victims are commonly poor, unemployed, and more susceptible to deceit and extortion. sec. 3. sense of congress. it is the sense of congress that-- (1) the kidnapping or coercion of individuals for the purpose of extracting their organs for profit is in contradiction of the ideals and standards for ethical behavior upon which the united states has based its laws; (2) the illegal harvesting of organs from children is a violation of the human rights of the child and is a breach of internationally accepted medical ethical standards described in who assembly resolution 57.18 (may 22, 2004); (3) the illegal harvesting and trafficking of organs violates the universal declaration of human rights, in article 3 which states that ``everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.'', and in article 4 which states that ``no one shall be held in slavery or servitude.''; and (4) establishing efficient voluntary organ donation systems with strong enforcement mechanisms is the most effective way to combat trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs. sec. 4. statement of policy. it shall be the policy of the united states to-- (1) combat the international trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs; (2) promote the establishment of voluntary organ donation systems with effective enforcement mechanisms in bilateral diplomatic meetings, as well as in international health forums; and (3) promote the dignity and security of human life in accordance with the universal declaration of human rights. sec. 5. revocation or denial of passports to individuals who are organ traffickers. the act entitled ``an act to regulate the issue and validity of passports, and for other purposes'', approved july 3, 1926 (22 u.s.c. 211a et seq.), which is commonly known as the ``passport act of 1926'', is amended by adding at the end the following: ``sec. 4. authority to deny or revoke passport. ``(a) issuance.--the secretary of state may refuse to issue a passport to any individual who has been convicted of an offense under section 301 of the national organ transplant act (42 u.s.c. 274e) if such individual used a passport or otherwise crossed an international border in the commission of such an offence. ``(b) revocation.--the secretary of state may revoke a passport previously issued to any individual described in paragraph (1).''. sec. 6. amendments to the trafficking victims protection act of 2000. (a) definitions.--section 103 of the trafficking victims protection act of 2000 (22 u.s.c. 7102) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (9)-- (a) in subparagraph (a), by striking ``or'' at the end; (b) in subparagraph (b), by striking the period at the end and inserting: ``; or''; and (c) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(c) trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs (as defined in paragraph (13)).''; (2) by redesignating paragraphs (13) through (15) as paragraphs (14) through (16), respectively; and (3) by inserting after paragraph (12) the following new paragraph: ``(13) trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs.-- ``(a) in general.--the term `trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs' means the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of a person, either living or deceased, for the purpose of removing one or more of the person's organs, by means of-- ``(i) coercion; ``(ii) abduction; ``(iii) deception; ``(iv) fraud; ``(v) abuse of power or a position of vulnerability; or ``(vi) transfer of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over a person described in the matter preceding clause (i). ``(b) organ defined.--in subparagraph (a), the term `organ' has the meaning given the term `human organ' in section 301(c)(1) of the national organ transplant act (42 u.s.c. 274e(c)(1)).''. (b) interagency task force to monitor and combat trafficking.--section 105(d)(3) of the trafficking victims protection act of 2000 (22 u.s.c. 7103(d)(3)) is amended by inserting after the first sentence the following new sentence: ``such procedures shall include collection and organization of data from human rights officers at united states embassies on host country's laws against trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs and any instances of violations of such laws.''. sec. 7. reporting. (a) in general.--not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this act, and annually thereafter through 2024, the secretary of state shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a comprehensive report that includes the following information: (1) a description of the sources, practices, methods, facilitators, and recipients of trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs during the period covered by each such report.

(2) organ.--the term ``organ'' has the meaning given the term ``human organ'' in section 301(c)(1) of the national organ transplant act (42 u.s.c. 274e(c)(1)). (3) trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs.--the term ``trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs'' means the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt

position of vulnerability; or (f) transfer of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over a person described in the matter preceding clause (i). sec. 9. limitation on funds. no additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this act or any amendment made by this act. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from california (mr. royce) and the gentleman from new york (mr. engel) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. general leave mr. royce. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i want to thank mr. trott and mr. deutch for introducing this important bill. the concept here is to combat the horrific crime of human trafficking for organ removal. and, as always, i appreciate the support of the ranking member, mr. eliot engel, in moving this antitrafficking bill forward. as hard as it is for us to accept this, as shocking as this is, the circumstances are such that rising global demand and a lack of adequate laws in many countries has fueled the growth of a worldwide black market for transplant organs. the world health organization estimates that 10 percent of all transplanted organs worldwide are illegally obtained. that would mean that they were being coerced from vulnerable populations or forcibly harvested from prisoners. often these prisoners are shot first in order to obtain organs, such as hearts, corneas, or lungs. they [[page h3723]] are taken from hostages. they are taken from oppressed minorities. an example would be kidneys or part of a liver. these abuses are more than just grave human rights violations. they also have worldwide implications for national security and public health. what do we mean when we say implications for national security? well, criminal organizations and terrorist groups are increasingly engaging in this black market industry that is valued now at a billion dollars. to give you some of the most extreme examples: isis recently issued a fatwa sanctioning forced organ harvesting from captives and, as they call them, from apostates; and traffickers smuggling refugees into europe have reportedly coerced organ donations, coerced a kidney as payment for travel. a number of studies have underscored how this shady commerce also creates biosecurity threats to the rest of the world. recipients of infected tissue or organs may become human carriers of disease. or another problem is drug-resistant pathogens that contribute to the spread of pandemics and antibiotic resistance. now, the u.s. has led the fight against human trafficking, and i would add, with help from the foreign affairs committee, with help from the legislation that we, our members on the committee, have authored. this bill continues and expands that effort, and it does so by closing the gap in u.s. law that currently fails to recognize the trafficking in persons for the removal of their organs as a form of human trafficking. specifically, this bill also makes it the policy of the united states to combat such trafficking, to promote the adoption of effective voluntary organ donation systems in bilateral engagements and multinational health forums that we have with other countries. and it requires an annual report to congress, an annual report on human trafficking for organ removal, which details activities by our state department and by other countries to combat this crime. finally, the bill allows for the revocation of passports from any individual that is involved in this kind of activity, that is convicted of an organ trafficking offense under the national organ transplant act, as well as permitting the denial of visas to applicants with such convictions. so i urge all members to support this important measure. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this measure, and i yield myself such time as i may consume. before i begin, this is the first time i have spoken on the house floor since the horrific attack in orlando, and i just want to take a brief moment to talk about it. this was a shocking hate crime against the lgbt community, a jarring and disgusting attack on our lgbt brothers and sisters, and on the progress lgbt rights have made in this country. and, of course, this was also a terrorist attack, and we need to look at it in the broader context of how we're working to meet the challenge of violent extremism here and around the world. mr. speaker, since yesterday morning, there has been an outpouring of thoughts and prayers for the victims in orlando and their loved ones; and, to be sure, moral and spiritual support are a part of how we grieve and heal. we are all angry about this heinous attack. we are all heartbroken. we are all committed to finding answers. we are all standing together, and we will move forward from this tragedy together. but, as lawmakers, we are empowered to do more than think and pray. in fact, we are certainly empowered to do more. i certainly have my views on what is necessary on the domestic side to stop this slaughter by gun violence, but i will leave that contentious debate aside for the moment. what i will say is that, on the foreign affairs committee, republicans and democrats have found a great deal of common ground on what sort of measures will help to keep us safe and to confront the threat of violent extremism. what has guided us in the past: the spirit of nonpartisanship and the belief that politics should stop at the water's edge, should continue to inform our work. turning to this bill, let me thank the chairman of the foreign affairs committee, ed royce; and i want to thank mr. trott and mr. deutch for all of their hard work on this measure. the world health organization estimates that 10 percent of all transplanted organs worldwide are illegally obtained. that is an alarming number; but, like so many illegal enterprises, this is a crime that is poorly understood, that seeks out zones of impunity where the light of the law doesn't shine and where information is hard to come by. so with a handful of estimates and reports, we are left asking: who are the victims of this crime? how do they become trapped by this illegal trade? what pressures and vulnerabilities made them susceptible? what are governments doing to halt the practice to track down those responsible and to provide services to survivors? should this challenge be included in our efforts to confront modern slavery, or is this a different sort of problem altogether? this bill will help us get answers to these questions. it calls for a report on this crime that will allow us to connect the dots. once we know what we are dealing with, then we can figure out the best way to act and chart a path forward. so i am glad to support it. i thank the chairman and the bill's sponsors again. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. trott), who is the author of this bill. mr. trott. mr. speaker, i want to begin by thanking chairman royce, ranking member engel, the committee staff, and mena hanna from my office for their work on h.r. 3694. i also want to thank my colleague, representative deutch, for coauthoring the stop organ trafficking act with me. illegal trafficking of human organs has long been a terrible and heinous crime, but unfortunately our policies and laws have not kept pace with this outrageous practice. china has been inexplicably targeting the falun gong for years, and more recently, isis has reportedly been resorting to this brutal practice to finance their nefarious activities and strike fear in the hearts of innocent people. late last year, isis released a religious edict stating that taking organs from a living captive to save a muslim's life was permissible, making religious minorities all over the middle east, like the chaldeans and the assyrians, even more vulnerable. other helpless groups of people, like refugees, have reportedly been selling their organs on the black market through dealers who then sell the organs to foreign countries in what is quickly becoming an unchecked and lucrative business. mr. speaker, it is time for the united states to take a leading role in combatting this heinous crime and standing with the world's most vulnerable. we must ensure that our country is doing everything within our power to destroy any revenue stream that isis relies on to further its terrorist activities. my bill is a start to this lengthy process, and i urge my colleagues to vote in support of this timely legislation. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. smith). {time} 1745 mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i want to thank chairman royce again for bringing this important bill to the floor, and to eliot engel for his leadership and mr. deutch, and especially to mr. trott, the sponsor of h.r. 3694, the strategy

CREC-2016-06-13-pt1-PgH3727,CREC-2016-06-13,114,EXPRESSING CONCERN REGARDING STATE-SANCTIONED ORGAN HARVESTING IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3727-H3730] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXPRESSING CONCERN REGARDING STATE-SANCTIONED ORGAN HARVESTING IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 343) expressing concern regarding persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the People's Republic of China, including from large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners and members of other religious and ethnic minority groups, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: [[Page H3728]] H. Res. 343 Whereas when performed in accordance with ethical standards, the medical discipline of organ transplantation is one of the great achievements of modern medicine; Whereas voluntary and informed consent is the precondition for ethical organ donation and international medical organizations state that prisoners, deprived of their freedom, are not in the position to give free consent and that the practice of sourcing organs from prisoners is a violation of ethical guidelines in medicine; Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China and Communist Party of China continue to deny reports that many organs are taken without the consent of prisoners yet at the same time prevents independent verification of its transplant system; Whereas the organ transplantation system in China does not comply with the World Health Organization's requirement of transparency and traceability in organ procurement pathways; Whereas the United States Department of State Country Report on Human Rights for China for 2014 stated, ``Advocacy groups continued to report instances of organ harvesting from prisoners''; Whereas Huang Jiefu, director of the China Organ Donation Committee, announced in December 2014 that China would end the practice of organ harvesting from executed prisoners by January 1, 2015, did not directly address organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience; Whereas Falun Gong, a spiritual practice involving meditative ``qigong'' exercises and centered on the values of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance, became immensely popular in the 1990s; Whereas in July 1999, the Chinese Communist Party launched an intensive, nationwide persecution designed to eradicate the spiritual practice of Falun Gong, reflecting the party's long-standing intolerance of large independent civil society groups; Whereas since 1999, hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained extra-legally in reeducation-through-labor camps, detention centers, and prisons, where torture and abuse are routine; Whereas in many detention facilities and labor camps, Falun Gong prisoners of conscience comprise the majority of the population, and have been said to receive the longest sentences and the worst treatment; Whereas Freedom House reported in 2015 that Falun Gong practitioners comprise the largest portion of prisoners of conscience in China, and face an elevated risk of dying or being killed in custody; Whereas in 2006, Canadian researchers David Matas, human rights attorney, and David Kilgour, former Canadian Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific, conducted an independent investigation into allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners in China, and concluded that Falun Gong practitioners being killed for their organs was highly probable; Whereas Matas and Kilgour have implicated state and party entities in illicit organ harvesting, including domestic security services and military hospitals; Whereas researcher and journalist Ethan Gutmann published findings that Chinese security agencies began harvesting organs from members of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority group in the 1990s, including from Uyghur political prisoners; Whereas the United Nations Committee Against Torture and the Special Rapporteur on Torture have expressed concern over the allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners, and have called on the Government of the People's Republic of China to increase accountability and transparency in the organ transplant system and punish those responsible for abuses; and Whereas the killing of religious or political prisoners for the purpose of selling their organs for transplant is an egregious and intolerable violation of the fundamental right to life: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) condemns the practice of state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China; (2) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of China and Communist Party of China to immediately end the practice of organ harvesting from all prisoners of conscience; (3) demands an immediate end to the 17-year persecution of the Falun Gong spiritual practice by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China, and the immediate release of all Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience; (4) encourages the United States medical community to help raise awareness of unethical organ transplant practices in China; (5) calls on the People's Republic of China to allow a credible, transparent, and independent investigation into organ transplant abuses; and (6) calls on the United States Department of State to conduct a more detailed analysis on state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the annual Human Rights Report, and report annually to Congress on the implementation of section 232 of the Department of State Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (8 U.S.C. 1182f), barring provision of visas to Chinese and other nationals engaged in coerced organ or bodily tissue transplantation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. {time} 1815 General Leave Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their leadership, for their support for human rights in China and, indeed, around the globe. I also want to thank my good friend, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), for joining me in introducing this bipartisan resolution that has garnered over 180 cosponsors. Many may not know this, Mr. Speaker, but Mr. Connolly has been working on these issues ever since he was a staffer for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I am proud to have introduced H. Res. 343 alongside my friend from Virginia, a resolution that condemns China's ongoing, gruesome practice of harvesting organs from nonconsenting prisoners of conscience and religious and ethnic minorities. Falun Gong practitioners have long faced an intensive persecution by the Chinese Communist Party and, according to Freedom House, in 2015, comprise the largest portion of prisoners of conscience in China. I was extremely disappointed to read that the State Department's latest human rights report for China quoted a Chinese official's unsubstantiated claim that any harvesting of organs from prisoners would now be voluntary. China has been well-known to produce the majority of organs it uses for transplants from executed prisoners, people who are deprived of their freedom, unable to give their voluntary and informed consent to donate their organs. These are the basic preconditions for ethical organ donation, which China rarely, if ever, meets. The regime of the People's Republic of China does not comply with the requirements of the World Health Organization for transparency and traceability in organ procurement pathways, and the number of voluntary organ donations in China continues to be much lower than the reported number of transplants, let alone the number of unreported ones. All of this points to unethical practices at the very least, and something much, much more inhumane and gruesome at the very worst, and leads us to conclude that China's claim to have ceased with illegal harvesting is a dubious one. The Chinese regime's brutal repression and human rights violations are well known, but it is the horrific treatment of the Falun Gong practitioners, Mr. Speaker, that is particularly egregious yet does not receive the attention that it deserves. Followers of the Falun Gong are among China's most vulnerable to state-sanctioned abuse, which leaves them as likely victims to this ghoulish practice; and if the latest reports of China seeking to conduct full-body transplants are true, then it could put these peaceful individuals in even graver danger. Last week, The New York Times reported that Chinese doctors are seeking to conduct full-body transplants. But again, with little transparency and the lack of ethical standards, one has to wonder, Mr. Speaker, how will these doctors, how will these scientists, conduct their research and experiments? They will likely look to their prisons and target prisoners of conscience--and Falun Gong practitioners, specifically. The New York Times reported that China remains an international pariah that has long been dogged by ethical issues, yet its doctors remain undeterred by the horrid practices and plan on moving forward when they are ready. [[Page H3729]] What will this mean for Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience in China, Mr. Speaker? I shudder to think of their fate as a result of these inhumane experiments and macabre practices. But by passing this resolution, sir, we can send a message to the Chinese regime that we condemn this continued practice of persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, and its sickening and unethical practice must stop, especially harvesting organs from nonconsenting individuals. We cannot allow these crimes to continue. I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC, June 2, 2016. Hon. Ed Royce, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing with respect to H. Res. 343, which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary. As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in H. Res. 343 that fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to discharge our committee from further consideration of this resolution so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H. Res. 343 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this resolution or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H. Res. 343 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration of this resolution. Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC, June 8, 2016. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for consulting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs on House Resolution 343, Expressing concern regarding persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non- consenting prisoners of conscience in the People's Republic of China, and for agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of that measure. I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I will seek to place our letters on H. Res. 343 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with your Committee as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Edward R. Royce, Chairman. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, I thank Chairman Royce and Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, who introduced this very important piece of legislation. We just finished debate on a bill that would help us get a better handle on just how severe a problem organ trafficking is and to help us figure out what is needed to confront this challenge. This resolution underscores troubling reports about the practice of organ trafficking, specifically in the People's Republic of China. I have heard directly from some of my constituents about this, and what is particularly unsettling is that this practice allegedly targets prisoners of conscience, including practitioners of Falun Gong and other religious and ethnic minorities. Nonconsensual organ harvesting under any circumstance represents a gross violation of human rights, but these allegations are particularly egregious: authorities at Chinese prisons targeting prisoners because of their religious beliefs and then making a profit by trafficking these victims' organs. I cannot think of hardly anything that is more disgusting than that. The accounts of these activities are gruesome and shocking, and, again, we need to get to the bottom of this issue to see exactly what is going on. This measure calls on the Chinese Government to cease the practice of forced organ harvesting and to end the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience. It also calls on the Chinese Government to allow an investigation into this issue, and it urges the State Department to include an assessment of state- sanctioned, nonconsensual organ harvesting in its annual human rights reports. So I again thank Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for her focus on this issue. I am pleased to support this measure. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for yielding. I want to thank the chairman emeritus of the full Foreign Affairs Committee for the defense of vulnerable persons in China, especially the Falun Gong, men and women who cannot speak for themselves, who have suffered unspeakable torture--some have survived--and to the families who have lost loved ones in Chinese prison camps, the Laogai, and detention centers that are sprinkled throughout all of China. This legislation is an important step in bringing accountability and transparency to what may be one of the great crimes of the 21st century: the 17-year effort to eliminate Falun Gong practice from China. I strongly believe that the campaign to eradicate Falun Gong will be seen as one of the great horrors. The Chinese Government continues to insist that the accounts of religious persecution, forced abortion, arbitrary detention, and organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners are mere rumors. They refuse to even discuss these issues in regular diplomatic dialogue and regularly jail and disbar lawyers who try to defend Falun Gong practitioners who expose the abuses that are committed by government employees. Nevertheless, evidence is quickly mounting of the horrific crimes committed against Falun Gong practitioners, including this terrible practice of organ harvesting. Over the years, Congress has received credible information about this unethical and corrupt organ transplant system that operates in China. The Chinese Government is at least grossly negligent but, more likely, grossly complicit in these crimes because huge amounts of money are made. We have received credible evidence that the actual number of organ transplants by China's hospitals remain underreported and that, despite the Chinese Government's promises to the contrary, the number of prisoners who are killed and have their organs taken continues to rise. Shockingly, researchers David Kilgour, David Matas, and Ethan Gutmann conducted detailed investigations and estimated that between 45,000 and 65,000 Falun Gong practitioners were killed for their organs, which then were sold for profit--45,000 to 65,000 victims who had their organs stolen and their lives snuffed out by the Chinese Government officials. There might be new estimates that are higher. These researchers will unveil their new findings next week at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Let me remind Members that the United States Congress isn't the only one that is bringing this terrible human rights abuse up. The U.N. Committee Against Torture and the Special Rapporteur on torture have expressed concern over these allegations, and they have called for accountability and transparency. The Ileana Ros-Lehtinen resolution condemns this practice; calls on the government to end it; demands an immediate end to the 17-year persecution of the Falun Gong; encourages the United States medical community to help raise awareness of unethical organ transplant practices in China; calls on the People's Republic of China to allow a credible, transparent, and independent investigation into organ transplant abuses; and then calls on the U.S. Department of State to conduct a more detailed analysis on state-sanctioned organ harvesting from nonconsenting prisoners of conscience in its annual [[Page H3730]] human rights report. And it also calls on the government, our government, to bar provision of visas, pursuant to current law, to Chinese and other nationals engaged in coerced organ or bodily tissue transplantation. Again, I want to thank Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mr. Connolly for their leadership on this. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close once Mr. Engel yields back his time. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, a commitment to human rights for people around the world is a fundamental American value and a pillar of our foreign policy. So when we hear reports of horrific abuses, such as state-sanctioned organ harvesting, we have a responsibility to determine the scope of the problem and respond. I want to thank Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for her tenacity in bringing this forward. I want to thank Mr. Smith, who is always there for human rights. I want to thank Chairman Royce, again, for allowing this resolution to come forward and, again, for making this a bipartisan concern. I have heard from colleagues and constituents again and again about grievous violations of human rights that Falun Gong and other prisoners of conscience have endured at the hands of Chinese authorities. We need to send a clear message that this sort of abuse is unacceptable. So again, I want to thank Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen for bringing our attention to this issue and bringing forward this measure. This is a resolution that everyone should vote for, and I urge a ``yes'' vote. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, sadly, the United States has receded from our role as a promoter and defender of human rights internationally. Once a central part of U.S. foreign policy, we have witnessed the protection of human rights fall far down on our priority list as administrations have become too eager to make deals with despots and tyrants in places like Iran, Cuba, and North Korea. Those who once looked to the United States to be the leader, to stand up and protect those suffering and those who are being denied their most basic and fundamental rights, no longer view us as the voice for the voiceless, willing to stand up for those suffering around the world. Shame on us, Mr. Speaker, because this failure to promote our ideals and our principles, well, that leads ruthless thugs to believe that they can get away with whatever they want, and, ultimately, it increases the suffering of the people that they exploit. The United States must once again make our core values and beliefs a central tenet of our foreign policy agenda in order to restore our credibility and to restore the faith that so many have in our ability to help bring about change for those who cannot protect themselves. {time} 1830 Passing this resolution today, Mr. Speaker, sends a clear signal to China that the United States opposes its gross violations of human rights, particularly against the Falun Gong practitioners. They are so peaceful, and they are so full of composure. They pose no threat to China, yet this ruthless dictatorship forces them to commit unspeakable acts. This resolution sends a signal to countless others suffering around the world that the United States will, once again, make the protection of human rights a priority. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us to support this resolution, support our ideals and values, support human rights, and help the practitioners of Falun Gong. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 343, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3727-H3730] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXPRESSING CONCERN REGARDING STATE-SANCTIONED ORGAN HARVESTING IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 343) expressing concern regarding persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the People's Republic of China, including from large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners and members of other religious and ethnic minority groups, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: [[Page H3728]] H. Res. 343 Whereas when performed in accordance with ethical standards, the medical discipline of organ transplantation is one of the great achievements of modern medicine; Whereas voluntary and informed consent is the precondition for ethical organ donation and international medical organizations state that prisoners, deprived of their freedom, are not in the position to give free consent and that the practice of sourcing organs from prisoners is a violation of ethical guidelines in medicine; Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China and Communist Party of China continue to deny reports that many organs are taken without the consent of prisoners yet at the same time prevents independent verification of its transplant system; Whereas the organ transplantation system in China does not comply with the World Health Organization's requirement of transparency and traceability in organ procurement pathways; Whereas the United States Department of State Country Report on Human Rights for China for 2014 stated, ``Advocacy groups continued to report instances of organ harvesting from prisoners''; Whereas Huang Jiefu, director of the China Organ Donation Committee, announced in December 2014 that China would end the practice of organ harvesting from executed prisoners by January 1, 2015, did not directly address organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience; Whereas Falun Gong, a spiritual practice involving meditative ``qigong'' exercises and centered on the values of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance, became immensely popular in the 1990s; Whereas in July 1999, the Chinese Communist Party launched an intensive, nationwide persecution designed to eradicate the spiritual practice of Falun Gong, reflecting the party's long-standing intolerance of large independent civil society groups; Whereas since 1999, hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained extra-legally in reeducation-through-labor camps, detention centers, and prisons, where torture and abuse are routine; Whereas in many detention facilities and labor camps, Falun Gong prisoners of conscience comprise the majority of the population, and have been said to receive the longest sentences and the worst treatment; Whereas Freedom House reported in 2015 that Falun Gong practitioners comprise the largest portion of prisoners of conscience in China, and face an elevated risk of dying or being killed in custody; Whereas in 2006, Canadian researchers David Matas, human rights attorney, and David Kilgour, former Canadian Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific, conducted an independent investigation into allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners in China, and concluded that Falun Gong practitioners being killed for their organs was highly probable; Whereas Matas and Kilgour have implicated state and party entities in illicit organ harvesting, including domestic security services and military hospitals; Whereas researcher and journalist Ethan Gutmann published findings that Chinese security agencies began harvesting organs from members of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority group in the 1990s, including from Uyghur political prisoners; Whereas the United Nations Committee Against Torture and the Special Rapporteur on Torture have expressed concern over the allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners, and have called on the Government of the People's Republic of China to increase accountability and transparency in the organ transplant system and punish those responsible for abuses; and Whereas the killing of religious or political prisoners for the purpose of selling their organs for transplant is an egregious and intolerable violation of the fundamental right to life: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) condemns the practice of state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China; (2) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of China and Communist Party of China to immediately end the practice of organ harvesting from all prisoners of conscience; (3) demands an immediate end to the 17-year persecution of the Falun Gong spiritual practice by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China, and the immediate release of all Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience; (4) encourages the United States medical community to help raise awareness of unethical organ transplant practices in China; (5) calls on the People's Republic of China to allow a credible, transparent, and independent investigation into organ transplant abuses; and (6) calls on the United States Department of State to conduct a more detailed analysis on state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the annual Human Rights Report, and report annually to Congress on the implementation of section 232 of the Department of State Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (8 U.S.C. 1182f), barring provision of visas to Chinese and other nationals engaged in coerced organ or bodily tissue transplantation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. {time} 1815 General Leave Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their leadership, for their support for human rights in China and, indeed, around the globe. I also want to thank my good friend, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), for joining me in introducing this bipartisan resolution that has garnered over 180 cosponsors. Many may not know this, Mr. Speaker, but Mr. Connolly has been working on these issues ever since he was a staffer for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I am proud to have introduced H. Res. 343 alongside my friend from Virginia, a resolution that condemns China's ongoing, gruesome practice of harvesting organs from nonconsenting prisoners of conscience and religious and ethnic minorities. Falun Gong practitioners have long faced an intensive persecution by the Chinese Communist Party and, according to Freedom House, in 2015, comprise the largest portion of prisoners of conscience in China. I was extremely disappointed to read that the State Department's latest human rights report for China quoted a Chinese official's unsubstantiated claim that any harvesting of organs from prisoners would now be voluntary. China has been well-known to produce the majority of organs it uses for transplants from executed prisoners, people who are deprived of their freedom, unable to give their voluntary and informed consent to donate their organs. These are the basic preconditions for ethical organ donation, which China rarely, if ever, meets. The regime of the People's Republic of China does not comply with the requirements of the World Health Organization for transparency and traceability in organ procurement pathways, and the number of voluntary organ donations in China continues to be much lower than the reported number of transplants, let alone the number of unreported ones. All of this points to unethical practices at the very least, and something much, much more inhumane and gruesome at the very worst, and leads us to conclude that China's claim to have ceased with illegal harvesting is a dubious one. The Chinese regime's brutal repression and human rights violations are well known, but it is the horrific treatment of the Falun Gong practitioners, Mr. Speaker, that is particularly egregious yet does not receive the attention that it deserves. Followers of the Falun Gong are among China's most vulnerable to state-sanctioned abuse, which leaves them as likely victims to this ghoulish practice; and if the latest reports of China seeking to conduct full-body transplants are true, then it could put these peaceful individuals in even graver danger.

But again, with little transparency and the lack of ethical standards, one has to wonder, Mr. Speaker, how will these doctors, how will these scientists, conduct their research and experiments? They will likely look to their prisons and target prisoners of conscience--and Falun Gong practitioners, specifically. The New York Times reported that China remains an international pariah that has long been dogged by ethical issues, yet its doctors remain undeterred by the horrid practices and plan on moving forward when they are ready.

Whereas in many detention facilities and labor camps, Falun Gong prisoners of conscience comprise the majority of the population, and have been said to receive the longest sentences and the worst treatment; Whereas Freedom House reported in 2015 that Falun Gong practitioners comprise the largest portion of prisoners of conscience in China, and face an elevated risk of dying or being killed in custody; Whereas in 2006, Canadian researchers David Matas, human rights attorney, and David Kilgour, former Canadian Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific, conducted an independent investigation into allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners in China, and concluded that Falun Gong practitioners being killed for their organs was highly probable; Whereas Matas and Kilgour have implicated state and party entities in illicit organ harvesting, including domestic security services and military hospitals; Whereas researcher and journalist Ethan Gutmann published findings that Chinese security agencies began harvesting organs from members of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority group in the 1990s, including from Uyghur political prisoners; Whereas the United Nations Committee Against Torture and the Special Rapporteur on Torture have expressed concern over the allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners, and have called on the Government of the People's Republic of China to increase accountability and transparency in the organ transplant system and punish those responsible for abuses; and Whereas the killing of religious or political prisoners for the purpose of selling their organs for transplant is an egregious and intolerable violation of the fundamental right to life: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) condemns the practice of state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China; (2) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of China and Communist Party of China to immediately end the practice of organ harvesting from all prisoners of conscience; (3) demands an immediate end to the 17-year persecution of the Falun Gong spiritual practice by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China, and the immediate release of all Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience; (4) encourages the United States medical community to help raise awareness of unethical organ transplant practices in China; (5) calls on the People's Republic of China to allow a credible, transparent, and independent investigation into organ transplant abuses; and (6) calls on the United States Department of State to conduct a more detailed analysis on state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the annual Human Rights Report, and report annually to Congress on the implementation of section 232 of the Department of State Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (8 U.S.C. 1182f), barring provision of visas to Chinese and other nationals engaged in coerced organ or bodily tissue transplantation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. {time} 1815 General Leave Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their leadership, for their support for human rights in China and, indeed, around the globe. I also want to thank my good friend, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), for joining me in introducing this bipartisan resolution that has garnered over 180 cosponsors. Many may not know this, Mr. Speaker, but Mr. Connolly has been working on these issues ever since he was a staffer for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I am proud to have introduced H. Res. 343 alongside my friend from Virginia, a resolution that condemns China's ongoing, gruesome practice of harvesting organs from nonconsenting prisoners of conscience and religious and ethnic minorities. Falun Gong practitioners have long faced an intensive persecution by the Chinese Communist Party and, according to Freedom House, in 2015, comprise the largest portion of prisoners of conscience in China. I was extremely disappointed to read that the State Department's latest human rights report for China quoted a Chinese official's unsubstantiated claim that any harvesting of organs from prisoners would now be voluntary. China has been well-known to produce the majority of organs it uses for transplants from executed prisoners, people who are deprived of their freedom, unable to give their voluntary and informed consent to donate their organs. These are the basic preconditions for ethical organ donation, which China rarely, if ever, meets. The regime of the People's Republic of China does not comply with the requirements of the World Health Organization for transparency and traceability in organ procurement pathways, and the number of voluntary organ donations in China continues to be much lower than the reported number of transplants, let alone the number of unreported ones. All of this points to unethical practices at the very least, and something much, much more inhumane and gruesome at the very worst, and leads us to conclude that China's claim to have ceased with illegal harvesting is a dubious one. The Chinese regime's brutal repression and human rights violations are well known, but it is the horrific treatment of the Falun Gong practitioners, Mr. Speaker, that is particularly egregious yet does not receive the attention that it deserves. Followers of the Falun Gong are among China's most vulnerable to state-sanctioned abuse, which leaves them as likely victims to this ghoulish practice; and if the latest reports of China seeking to conduct full-body transplants are true, then it could put these peaceful individuals in even graver danger. Last week, The New York Times reported that Chinese doctors are seeking to conduct full-body transplants. But again, with little transparency and the lack of ethical standards, one has to wonder, Mr. Speaker, how will these doctors, how will these scientists, conduct their research and experiments? They will likely look to their prisons and target prisoners of conscience--and Falun Gong practitioners, specifically. The New York Times reported that China remains an international pariah that has long been dogged by ethical issues, yet its doctors remain undeterred by the horrid practices and plan on moving forward when they are ready. [[Page H3729]] What will this mean for Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience in China, Mr. Speaker? I shudder to think of their fate as a result of these inhumane experiments and macabre practices. But by passing this resolution, sir, we can send a message to the Chinese regime that we condemn this continued practice of persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, and its sickening and unethical practice must stop, especially harvesting organs from nonconsenting individuals. We cannot allow these crimes to continue. I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC, June 2, 2016. Hon. Ed Royce, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing with respect to H. Res. 343, which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary. As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in H. Res. 343 that fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to discharge our committee from further consideration of this resolution so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H. Res. 343 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this resolution or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H. Res. 343 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration of this resolution. Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC, June 8, 2016. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for consulting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs on House Resolution 343, Expressing concern regarding persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non- consenting prisoners of conscience in the People's Republic of China, and for agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of that measure. I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I will seek to place our letters on H. Res. 343 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with your Committee as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Edward R. Royce, Chairman. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, I thank Chairman Royce and Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, who introduced this very important piece of legislation. We just finished debate on a bill that would help us get a better handle on just how severe a problem organ trafficking is and to help us figure out what is needed to confront this challenge. This resolution underscores troubling reports about the practice of organ trafficking, specifically in the People's Republic of China. I have heard directly from some of my constituents about this, and what is particularly unsettling is that this practice allegedly targets prisoners of conscience, including practitioners of Falun Gong and other religious and ethnic minorities. Nonconsensual organ harvesting under any circumstance represents a gross violation of human rights, but these allegations are particularly egregious: authorities at Chinese prisons targeting prisoners because of their religious beliefs and then making a profit by trafficking these victims' organs. I cannot think of hardly anything that is more disgusting than that. The accounts of these activities are gruesome and shocking, and, again, we need to get to the bottom of this issue to see exactly what is going on. This measure calls on the Chinese Government to cease the practice of forced organ harvesting and to end the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience. It also calls on the Chinese Government to allow an investigation into this issue, and it urges the State Department to include an assessment of state- sanctioned, nonconsensual organ harvesting in its annual human rights reports. So I again thank Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for her focus on this issue. I am pleased to support this measure. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for yielding. I want to thank the chairman emeritus of the full Foreign Affairs Committee for the defense of vulnerable persons in China, especially the Falun Gong, men and women who cannot speak for themselves, who have suffered unspeakable torture--some have survived--and to the families who have lost loved ones in Chinese prison camps, the Laogai, and detention centers that are sprinkled throughout all of China. This legislation is an important step in bringing accountability and transparency to what may be one of the great crimes of the 21st century: the 17-year effort to eliminate Falun Gong practice from China. I strongly believe that the campaign to eradicate Falun Gong will be seen as one of the great horrors. The Chinese Government continues to insist that the accounts of religious persecution, forced abortion, arbitrary detention, and organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners are mere rumors. They refuse to even discuss these issues in regular diplomatic dialogue and regularly jail and disbar lawyers who try to defend Falun Gong practitioners who expose the abuses that are committed by government employees. Nevertheless, evidence is quickly mounting of the horrific crimes committed against Falun Gong practitioners, including this terrible practice of organ harvesting. Over the years, Congress has received credible information about this unethical and corrupt organ transplant system that operates in China. The Chinese Government is at least grossly negligent but, more likely, grossly complicit in these crimes because huge amounts of money are made. We have received credible evidence that the actual number of organ transplants by China's hospitals remain underreported and that, despite the Chinese Government's promises to the contrary, the number of prisoners who are killed and have their organs taken continues to rise. Shockingly, researchers David Kilgour, David Matas, and Ethan Gutmann conducted detailed investigations and estimated that between 45,000 and 65,000 Falun Gong practitioners were killed for their organs, which then were sold for profit--45,000 to 65,000 victims who had their organs stolen and their lives snuffed out by the Chinese Government officials. There might be new estimates that are higher. These researchers will unveil their new findings next week at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Let me remind Members that the United States Congress isn't the only one that is bringing this terrible human rights abuse up. The U.N. Committee Against Torture and the Special Rapporteur on torture have expressed concern over these allegations, and they have called for accountability and transparency. The Ileana Ros-Lehtinen resolution condemns this practice; calls on the government to end it; demands an immediate end to the 17-year persecution of the Falun Gong; encourages the United States medical community to help raise awareness of unethical organ transplant practices in China; calls on the People's Republic of China to allow a credible, transparent, and independent investigation into organ transplant abuses; and then calls on the U.S. Department of State to conduct a more detailed analysis on state-sanctioned organ harvesting from nonconsenting prisoners of conscience in its annual [[Page H3730]] human rights report. And it also calls on the government, our government, to bar provision of visas, pursuant to current law, to Chinese and other nationals engaged in coerced organ or bodily tissue transplantation. Again, I want to thank Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mr. Connolly for their leadership on this. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close once Mr. Engel yields back his time. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, a commitment to human rights for people around the world is a fundamental American value and a pillar of our foreign policy. So when we hear reports of horrific abuses, such as state-sanctioned organ harvesting, we have a responsibility to determine the scope of the problem and respond. I want to thank Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for her tenacity in bringing this forward. I want to thank Mr. Smith, who is always there for human rights. I want to thank Chairman Royce, again, for allowing this resolution to come forward and, again, for making this a bipartisan concern. I have heard from colleagues and constituents again and again about grievous violations of human rights that Falun Gong and other prisoners of conscience have endured at the hands of Chinese authorities. We need to send a clear message that this sort of abuse is unacceptable. So again, I want to thank Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen for bringing our attention to this issue and bringing forward this measure. This is a resolution that everyone should vote for, and I urge a ``yes'' vote. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, sadly, the United States has receded from our role as a promoter and defender of human rights internationally. Once a central part of U.S. foreign policy, we have witnessed the protection of human rights fall far down on our priority list as administrations have become too eager to make deals with despots and tyrants in places like Iran, Cuba, and North Korea. Those who once looked to the United States to be the leader, to stand up and protect those suffering and those who are being denied their most basic and fundamental rights, no longer view us as the voice for the voiceless, willing to stand up for those suffering around the world. Shame on us, Mr. Speaker, because this failure to promote our ideals and our principles, well, that leads ruthless thugs to believe that they can get away with whatever they want, and, ultimately, it increases the suffering of the people that they exploit. The United States must once again make our core values and beliefs a central tenet of our foreign policy agenda in order to restore our credibility and to restore the faith that so many have in our ability to help bring about change for those who cannot protect themselves. {time} 1830 Passing this resolution today, Mr. Speaker, sends a clear signal to China that the United States opposes its gross violations of human rights, particularly against the Falun Gong practitioners. They are so peaceful, and they are so full of composure. They pose no threat to China, yet this ruthless dictatorship forces them to commit unspeakable acts. This resolution sends a signal to countless others suffering around the world that the United States will, once again, make the protection of human rights a priority. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us to support this resolution, support our ideals and values, support human rights, and help the practitioners of Falun Gong. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 343, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_183.csv,22407,22407,22473,"[congressional record volume 162, number 93 (monday, june 13, 2016)] [house] [pages h3727-h3730] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] expressing concern regarding state-sanctioned organ harvesting in the people's republic of china ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (h. res. 343) expressing concern regarding persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the people's republic of china, including from large numbers of falun gong practitioners and members of other religious and ethnic minority groups, as amended. the clerk read the title of the resolution. the text of the resolution is as follows: [[page h3728]] h. res. 343 whereas when performed in accordance with ethical standards, the medical discipline of organ transplantation is one of the great achievements of modern medicine; whereas voluntary and informed consent is the precondition for ethical organ donation and international medical organizations state that prisoners, deprived of their freedom, are not in the position to give free consent and that the practice of sourcing organs from prisoners is a violation of ethical guidelines in medicine; whereas the government of the people's republic of china and communist party of china continue to deny reports that many organs are taken without the consent of prisoners yet at the same time prevents independent verification of its transplant system; whereas the organ transplantation system in china does not comply with the world health organization's requirement of transparency and traceability in organ procurement pathways; whereas the united states department of state country report on human rights for china for 2014 stated, ``advocacy groups continued to report instances of organ harvesting from prisoners''; whereas huang jiefu, director of the china organ donation committee, announced in december 2014 that china would end the practice of organ harvesting from executed prisoners by january 1, 2015, did not directly address organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience; whereas falun gong, a spiritual practice involving meditative ``qigong'' exercises and centered on the values of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance, became immensely popular in the 1990s; whereas in july 1999, the chinese communist party launched an intensive, nationwide persecution designed to eradicate the spiritual practice of falun gong, reflecting the party's long-standing intolerance of large independent civil society groups; whereas since 1999, hundreds of thousands of falun gong practitioners have been detained extra-legally in reeducation-through-labor camps, detention centers, and prisons, where torture and abuse are routine;

thank mr. smith, who is always there for human rights. i want to thank chairman royce, again, for allowing this resolution to come forward and, again, for making this a bipartisan concern. i have heard from colleagues and constituents again and again about grievous violations of human rights that falun gong and other prisoners of conscience have endured at the hands of chinese authorities. we need to send a clear message that this sort of abuse is unacceptable. so again, i want to thank congresswoman ros-lehtinen for bringing our attention to this issue and bringing forward this measure. this is a resolution that everyone should vote for, and i urge a ``yes'' vote. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, in recent years, sadly, the united states has receded from our role as a promoter and defender of human rights internationally. once a central part of u.s. foreign policy, we have witnessed the protection of human rights fall far down on our priority list as administrations have become too eager to make deals with despots and tyrants in places like iran, cuba, and north korea. those who once looked to the united states to be the leader, to stand up and protect those suffering and those who are being denied their most basic and fundamental rights, no longer view us as the voice for the voiceless, willing to stand up for those suffering around the world. shame on us, mr. speaker, because this failure to promote our ideals and our principles, well, that leads ruthless thugs to believe that they can get away with whatever they want, and, ultimately, it increases the suffering of the people that they exploit. the united states must once again make our core values and beliefs a central tenet of our foreign policy agenda in order to restore our credibility and to restore the faith that so many have in our ability to help bring about change for those who cannot protect themselves. {time} 1830 passing this resolution today, mr. speaker, sends a clear signal to china that the united states opposes its gross violations of human rights, particularly against the falun gong practitioners. they are so peaceful, and they are so full of composure. they pose no threat to china, yet this ruthless dictatorship forces them to commit unspeakable acts. this resolution sends a signal to countless others suffering around the world that the united states will, once again, make the protection of human rights a priority. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to join us to support this resolution, support our ideals and values, support human rights, and help the practitioners of falun gong. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen) that the house suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, h. res. 343, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",22407
CREC-2016-06-13-pt1-PgH3719,CREC-2016-06-13,114,OVERSEE VISA INTEGRITY WITH STAKEHOLDER ADVISORIES ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3719-H3721] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OVERSEE VISA INTEGRITY WITH STAKEHOLDER ADVISORIES ACT Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3636) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow labor organizations and management organizations to receive the results of visa petitions about which such organizations have submitted advisory opinions, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3636 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Oversee Visa Integrity with Stakeholder Advisories Act'' or the ``O-VISA Act''. SEC. 2. ALLOWING CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS TO RECEIVE THE RESULTS OF VISA PETITIONS. Section 214(c)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(3)) is amended-- (1) by striking ``Attorney General'' each place it appears and inserting ``Secretary of Homeland Security''; and (2) in the first sentence of the matter following subparagraph (B)-- (A) by striking ``and (iv)'' and inserting ``(iv)''; and (B) by striking the period at the end and inserting the following: ``, and (v) upon making the decision, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the decision to each organization with which the Secretary consulted under subparagraph (A) or (B).''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters). general leave Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 3636, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California? There was no objection. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank Mr. Nadler and all of the other cosponsors in their helping to advance H.R. 3636, the Oversee Visa Integrity with Stakeholder Advisories Act, otherwise referred to as the O-VISA Act, for a floor vote. Congress established the O visa program to allow non-immigrants with extraordinary abilities to be employed in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. In recognition of the unique nature of the motion picture and television industry, Congress established special evidentiary criteria for O-1 and O-2 visas for artists who are working in the industry. One requirement mandates that the USCIS consult with the appropriate labor and management organizations for each visa petition. The reason for this is very simple in that those organizations are best suited to evaluate whether a visa applicant has demonstrated extraordinary achievement--the standard for O-1 and O-2 visa petitioners in this industry. These consulting organizations dedicate substantial resources to advise the USCIS on the merits of visa petitions. They are essential to identifying fraud as well as to protecting U.S. workers who are capable of filling those jobs. Unfortunately, these organizations are never notified as to the USCIS' final petition decisions. The consulting organizations should be notified of these decisions so that they may better assist the USCIS in determining fraud and in properly implementing the O visa standards. There have been serious indications of fraud in O-1 and O-2 visa petitions, including the outright forgery of advisory opinions, shell production companies, and sponsoring employers who are without any connection to the motion picture and television industry. These concerns led Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers to send a letter to the USCIS in 2014, which stated: It seems that, at the very least, USCIS should be notifying these organizations when it approves petitions over their objections. However, we are told that such organizations are rarely, if ever, notified regarding the outcome of petitions to which they object. Ensuring transparency in the adjudication process for any visa program is essential to a secure and effective immigration policy, and, therefore, we are concerned about the reported potential fraud in O-1 and O-2 visa petitions. It is important to note that there are no indications of abuse by the major studios, such as members of the MPAA. In fact, it is my understanding that the labor and management consulting organizations concur with the vast majority of O visa petitions that are submitted by the major studios. The O-VISA Act, which Mr. Nadler and I have put forth, is a narrow provision that injects transparency into this visa petition process. It amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide a copy of the USCIS visa petition decision to the consulting organization that was required to provide the advisory opinion for that specific petition. Essentially, the organization will be copied on the agency decision. Congress wisely recognized that the opinions of these private stakeholders deserve proper consideration due to their unique expertise in the industry. Congress should further utilize that expertise by authorizing the USCIS to copy these organizations because this will assist in identifying fraud and in protecting American jobs. I was pleased to receive the recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that H.R. 3636 will have no significant cost to the taxpayer. In fact, any associated costs will be recouped from fees that are collected by the Department of Homeland Security in the visa application process. Simply put, H.R. 3636 is a model of commonsense, bipartisan legislation that utilizes private sector expertise to improve our governance. I will take this opportunity to note that there are other issues regarding O visas that must be addressed. In particular, there are serious concerns that the USCIS' decisionmaking process moves far too slowly. This lack of efficiency means that film and television face considerable delays and unnecessary costs. I am committed to working with the committee and the industry to address these issues in the future. [[Page H3720]] I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3636, the O-VISA Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to support the O-VISA Act, which is a narrow, but important, bill. I thank my Judiciary Committee colleagues--the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler)--for their bipartisan effort in introducing this legislation, which will bring needed transparency to the O visa petition process. For individuals who seek an O visa specifically to work on a motion picture or a television production, the law requires that an individual have a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement, which must be recognized in the field through extensive documentation. In recognizing the need to balance the demand for a global exchange of creative professionals with the need to prevent the displacement of American workers, current law requires that O visa petitioners provide a written advisory opinion from an appropriate labor organization regarding the beneficiary's qualifications. For example, when petitioning for a foreign director, a petitioner must seek an opinion from the Directors Guild of America. As experts in their fields, these labor organizations are in a great position to appraise a beneficiary's qualifications. This process is intended to ensure that only the most extraordinary and accomplished individuals are granted an O visa. The O-VISA Act requires that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services provide a copy of the agency decision to the labor union that is consulted as part of the petition when one seeks work in a motion picture or on television. By doing this, the bill will help ensure that the union consultation is a meaningful part of the agency adjudication, as required under current law; and it will bring transparency for employers, workers, and the organizations that represent them, which is always a good thing. I do believe, as the gentlewoman has indicated, we could do more in this area. For example, we should be providing for the portability of O-1 visa holders and others so they can move between jobs. Portability not only helps employers in the industry, but it also ensures that foreign workers aren't trapped in positions or are used to undercut the wages of U.S. workers. I hope that we can continue the bipartisan effort that produced this legislation to make further improvements to the O visa program. As indicated during the consideration of the bill in the Judiciary Committee, the language contained in this bill has been coupled with provisions that also make important changes to the O visa program that were included in the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform from the last Congress, which died here on the House side. That bill provided for portability; it removed redundancies; and it better aligned these programs with others that involved honorarium or appearance fees. I know that we are not doing an entire rewrite of the immigration laws at this juncture, but I am hopeful that we will continue to work on these further improvements as this chairman has indicated he would be interested in. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't say what we all know too well, which is that we have enormous problems in our immigration system. I hope that we can work together on real, substantial fixes on behalf of not just the movie industry--as important as that industry is--but for families, refugees, and employers in a range of industries, including agriculture and the high-skilled sector. Over the years, I have worked with friends on the other side of the aisle on immigration reforms, big and small, and I continue to stand ready to do so in the future. I thank the Speaker, the bill's authors, and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters). I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson). Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank the gentlewoman from California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3636, the Oversee Visa Integrity with Stakeholder Advisories Act, also known as the O-VISA Act. I support this bipartisan legislation because it will strengthen the role of labor unions in the O visa petition process, a process by which international artists and entertainers with extraordinary ability are brought to the United States. {time} 1730 As many of you may know, my home State of Georgia is one of the Nation's leading locations for film and television production. Since the State updated its tax laws, this industry has generated approximately $800 million annually in economic development, and it is credited with supporting about 11,000 jobs in Georgia. In June alone, there were more than 23 movies and TV shows being filmed in the State. And as more studios and production teams move to Georgia, the demand for international talent will continue to rise. While international audiences have a strong appreciation and demand for American movies, music, and other forms of entertainment, we also want talent from other countries to come to the United States for our enjoyment. In such instances, however, we must ensure that the immigration process effectively balances the needs of the entertainment industry while protecting the rights and interests of American workers. Congress has long realized that this is a delicate balance, which is why we created a specific role for American labor unions to participate in the O visa petition process for foreign artists and entertainers. Unions help ensure safe working conditions and fair wages for all, regardless of nationality. Under the O visa consultation process, unions provide informed opinions on these significant issues. The bill before us today makes an important change to current law. It requires the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to provide labor organizations the results of decisions for cases in which they submitted advisory opinions. This new requirement will bring transparency to the O visa process. In addition, this measure will enable labor unions to better monitor the outcomes of O visa cases and reduce uncertainty about the number of entertainment jobs filled by international artists. H.R. 3636 will further strengthen international artistic exchange while promoting American workers. In closing, I want to thank my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Representatives Mimi Walters and Jerrold Nadler, for their leadership in crafting this bipartisan legislation. H.R. 3636 is a good bill, and I am pleased to support it. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I will close by thanking everyone for their support of this bill. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3636, the O-VISA Act. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3636, the O-VISA Act. As the lead Democratic cosponsor, I also want to thank the Gentlewoman from California, Mrs. Walters, for introducing this legislation, which will bring some needed transparency to the O visa application process. O visas are reserved for individuals with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics to perform temporary work in their field here in the United States. For those seeking an O visa specifically to work on a motion picture or television production, the law requires that an individual have ``a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement,'' which must be ``recognized in the field through extensive documentation.'' Through a unique provision in the law, an applicant for an O visa seeking to work on a film or television production must first obtain an opinion from the relevant labor organization in their field. For example, a director must seek an opinion from the Directors Guild of America, and a set designer must consult with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. As experts in their field, these organizations are in the best position to determine an applicant's special qualifications. This process is intended to ensure that only the [[Page H3721]] most extraordinary and accomplished individuals--those who are so unique that they could not be replaced by an American worker--are granted an O visa. Unfortunately, in recent years, several unions have expressed deep concerns that a significant number of applicants for whom they have recommended denial have been admitted into the United States nonetheless. In some instances, the unions have documented fraud on the part of the applicant, while in some cases, the government simply reached a different conclusion. But, because the consulting union is never informed by the government whether a particular application was approved or denied, it is impossible to know the full extent of this problem. The O-VISA Act would bring needed transparency to this process by requiring USCIS to provide a copy of any final determination to the consulting union. This is a narrow, but critically important provision. Although the unions have expended a great deal of resources to discover the outcome of their advisory opinions, they are in the dark about the vast majority of cases. Although they could serve as a partner to USCIS in rooting out fraud and abuse, they lack the information they need to follow up on suspicious cases. I should point out that the unions have assured me that their concerns about fraud do not stem from any applications by the major studios. The problems occur with certain unscrupulous independent companies that abuse the process in a variety of ways. Of course, there need not be any fraud for USCIS to reach a different conclusion about the merits of a particular applicant. But, if this is occurring in a significant number of cases, it may signify a systemic problem in how the agency is considering applications, or a lack of understanding by the union of how cases should be evaluated. In either case, it is only fair that the unions have sufficient knowledge of how petitions are decided so that they can have a meaningful discussion with USCIS about any concerns they may have. The O-VISA Act would provide the transparency necessary to undertake this process and I urge my colleagues to support it. I want to note that since this bill simply requires that USCIS provide a copy of any final decision to the consulting organization, it should not burden the agency or add any delays in processing O visa applications. However, I recognize that many sponsoring employers have expressed concerns over the inefficiency of the current process, and that reforms are needed to streamline the application process. The language contained in H.R. 3636 has historically been coupled with provisions that also make important changes to the O- and B- visa programs for those seeking entry for motion picture and television productions. These provisions were included in such bills as the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform legislation from last Congress. Specifically, these changes provided the same commonsense portability that exists in other visa categories, removed redundancies in the consultation process, and better aligned these entry programs with others that might involve an honorarium or appearance fee. I appreciate Chairman Goodlatte's assurances during the markup on the O-VISA Act that he intends to address these commonsense changes to the O- and B-programs that have historically accompanied the provisions in this bill in the future. And I am pleased that we are advancing this bill today. The O-VISA Act will help ensure the integrity of the O visa program while protecting the jobs of American artists and craftsmen in the film and television industries. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 3636, the ``Oversee Visa Integrity with Stakeholder Advisories Act'', also known as the O-VISA Act. H.R. 3636 is an important bill that supports the need and aim for comprehensive immigration reform and strengthens the role of the labor unions in the O-lB consultation process. H.R. 3636 would strengthen the role of the labor unions in the O-1B consultation process by amending the ``Immigration and Nationality Act'' to require U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to provide a copy of the O-1B petition decision to the labor union that was consulted as part of the petition process for a foreign artists and performers seeking to work in the United States. This bill would also require an annual report to Congress from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enumerating the adjudicative outcomes of O-1B petitions with a focus on the relationship between the USCIS decision and the recommendation provided in the labor union consultation. Although H.R. 3636 deals specifically with the O-1B visa, the O nonimmigrant classification is commonly sub-classified in the following categories: O-1A: individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry); O-1B: individuals with an extraordinary ability in the arts or extraordinary achievement in motion picture or television industry; and O-2: individuals who will accompany an O-1, artist or athlete, to asset in a specific event or performance. For an O-1A, the O-2's assistance must be an ``integral part'' of the O-1A's activity. For an O-1B, the O-2's assistance must be ``essential'' to the completion of the O-1B's production. The O-2 worker has critical skills and experience with the O-1 that cannot be readily performed by a U.S. worker and which are essential to the successful performance of the O-1. In creating the O-1B visa category, Congress sought a balance between the need for global interchange of creative professionals, and the need to prevent entertainment producers from abusing the immigration laws and the ability of individuals to obtain a visa for extraordinary ability. In doing so, Congress created the O nonimmigrant visa, pursuant to an amendment to the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), for individuals who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, or who have a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry and have been recognized nationally or internationally for those achievements. The changes under IMMACT led to unintended conflicts between labor and management in the industry. Labor and management reached a settlement, reflected in current law and regulations that give weight, but not control, to labor union advisory opinions of the abilities and professional prestige of foreign artists and performers sought by industry management. By requiring that USCIS provide a copy of the 0-1B petition decision to the labor union that was consulted, H.R. 3636 will provide labor unions with important data allowing them to see how their consultations are used by the adjudication agency. H.R. 3636 will reinforce the labor union's position in the adjudication process and lay the groundwork for further legislative action if the newly provided information suggests that more reform is warranted. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3636, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow labor organizations and management organizations to receive the results of visa petitions about which such organizations have submitted advisory opinions.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3719-H3721] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OVERSEE VISA INTEGRITY WITH STAKEHOLDER ADVISORIES ACT Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California.

While international audiences have a strong appreciation and demand for American movies, music, and other forms of entertainment, we also want talent from other countries to come to the United States for our enjoyment. In such instances, however, we must ensure that the immigration process effectively balances the needs of the entertainment industry while protecting the rights and interests of American workers. Congress has long realized that this is a delicate balance, which is why we created a specific role for American labor unions to participate in the O visa petition process for foreign artists and entertainers. Unions help ensure safe working conditions and fair wages for all, regardless of nationality. Under the O visa consultation process, unions provide informed opinions on these significant issues. The bill before us today makes an important change to current law. It requires the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to provide labor organizations the results of decisions for cases in which they submitted advisory opinions. This new requirement will bring transparency to the O visa process. In addition, this measure will enable labor unions to better monitor the outcomes of O visa cases and reduce uncertainty about the number of entertainment jobs filled by international artists. H.R. 3636 will further strengthen international artistic exchange while promoting American workers. In closing, I want to thank my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Representatives Mimi Walters and Jerrold Nadler, for their leadership in crafting this bipartisan legislation. H.R. 3636 is a good bill, and I am pleased to support it. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I will close by thanking everyone for their support of this bill. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3636, the O-VISA Act. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3636, the O-VISA Act. As the lead Democratic cosponsor, I also want to thank the Gentlewoman from California, Mrs. Walters, for introducing this legislation, which will bring some needed transparency to the O visa application process. O visas are reserved for individuals with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics to perform temporary work in their field here in the United States. For those seeking an O visa specifically to work on a motion picture or television production, the law requires that an individual have ``a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement,'' which must be ``recognized in the field through extensive documentation.'' Through a unique provision in the law, an applicant for an O visa seeking to work on a film or television production must first obtain an opinion from the relevant labor organization in their field. For example, a director must seek an opinion from the Directors Guild of America, and a set designer must consult with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. As experts in their field, these organizations are in the best position to determine an applicant's special qualifications. This process is intended to ensure that only the [[Page H3721]] most extraordinary and accomplished individuals--those who are so unique that they could not be replaced by an American worker--are granted an O visa. Unfortunately, in recent years, several unions have expressed deep concerns that a significant number of applicants for whom they have recommended denial have been admitted into the United States nonetheless. In some instances, the unions have documented fraud on the part of the applicant, while in some cases, the government simply reached a different conclusion. But, because the consulting union is never informed by the government whether a particular application was approved or denied, it is impossible to know the full extent of this problem. The O-VISA Act would bring needed transparency to this process by requiring USCIS to provide a copy of any final determination to the consulting union. This is a narrow, but critically important provision. Although the unions have expended a great deal of resources to discover the outcome of their advisory opinions, they are in the dark about the vast majority of cases. Although they could serve as a partner to USCIS in rooting out fraud and abuse, they lack the information they need to follow up on suspicious cases. I should point out that the unions have assured me that their concerns about fraud do not stem from any applications by the major studios. The problems occur with certain unscrupulous independent companies that abuse the process in a variety of ways. Of course, there need not be any fraud for USCIS to reach a different conclusion about the merits of a particular applicant. But, if this is occurring in a significant number of cases, it may signify a systemic problem in how the agency is considering applications, or a lack of understanding by the union of how cases should be evaluated. In either case, it is only fair that the unions have sufficient knowledge of how petitions are decided so that they can have a meaningful discussion with USCIS about any concerns they may have. The O-VISA Act would provide the transparency necessary to undertake this process and I urge my colleagues to support it. I want to note that since this bill simply requires that USCIS provide a copy of any final decision to the consulting organization, it should not burden the agency or add any delays in processing O visa applications. However, I recognize that many sponsoring employers have expressed concerns over the inefficiency of the current process, and that reforms are needed to streamline the application process. The language contained in H.R. 3636 has historically been coupled with provisions that also make important changes to the O- and B- visa programs for those seeking entry for motion picture and television productions. These provisions were included in such bills as the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform legislation from last Congress. Specifically, these changes provided the same commonsense portability that exists in other visa categories, removed redundancies in the consultation process, and better aligned these entry programs with others that might involve an honorarium or appearance fee. I appreciate Chairman Goodlatte's assurances during the markup on the O-VISA Act that he intends to address these commonsense changes to the O- and B-programs that have historically accompanied the provisions in this bill in the future. And I am pleased that we are advancing this bill today. The O-VISA Act will help ensure the integrity of the O visa program while protecting the jobs of American artists and craftsmen in the film and television industries. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 3636, the ``Oversee Visa Integrity with Stakeholder Advisories Act'', also known as the O-VISA Act. H.R. 3636 is an important bill that supports the need and aim for comprehensive immigration reform and strengthens the role of the labor unions in the O-lB consultation process. H.R. 3636 would strengthen the role of the labor unions in the O-1B consultation process by amending the ``Immigration and Nationality Act'' to require U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to provide a copy of the O-1B petition decision to the labor union that was consulted as part of the petition process for a foreign artists and performers seeking to work in the United States. This bill would also require an annual report to Congress from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enumerating the adjudicative outcomes of O-1B petitions with a focus on the relationship between the USCIS decision and the recommendation provided in the labor union consultation. Although H.R. 3636 deals specifically with the O-1B visa, the O nonimmigrant classification is commonly sub-classified in the following categories: O-1A: individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry); O-1B: individuals with an extraordinary ability in the arts or extraordinary achievement in motion picture or television industry; and O-2: individuals who will accompany an O-1, artist or athlete, to asset in a specific event or performance. For an O-1A, the O-2's assistance must be an ``integral part'' of the O-1A's activity. For an O-1B, the O-2's assistance must be ``essential'' to the completion of the O-1B's production. The O-2 worker has critical skills and experience with the O-1 that cannot be readily performed by a U.S. worker and which are essential to the successful performance of the O-1. In creating the O-1B visa category, Congress sought a balance between the need for global interchange of creative professionals, and the need to prevent entertainment producers from abusing the immigration laws and the ability of individuals to obtain a visa for extraordinary ability. In doing so, Congress created the O nonimmigrant visa, pursuant to an amendment to the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), for individuals who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, or who have a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry and have been recognized nationally or internationally for those achievements. The changes under IMMACT led to unintended conflicts between labor and management in the industry. Labor and management reached a settlement, reflected in current law and regulations that give weight, but not control, to labor union advisory opinions of the abilities and professional prestige of foreign artists and performers sought by industry management. By requiring that USCIS provide a copy of the 0-1B petition decision to the labor union that was consulted, H.R. 3636 will provide labor unions with important data allowing them to see how their consultations are used by the adjudication agency. H.R. 3636 will reinforce the labor union's position in the adjudication process and lay the groundwork for further legislative action if the newly provided information suggests that more reform is warranted. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3636, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow labor organizations and management organizations to receive the results of visa petitions about which such organizations have submitted advisory opinions.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3719-H3721] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OVERSEE VISA INTEGRITY WITH STAKEHOLDER ADVISORIES ACT Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3636) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow labor organizations and management organizations to receive the results of visa petitions about which such organizations have submitted advisory opinions, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3636 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Oversee Visa Integrity with Stakeholder Advisories Act'' or the ``O-VISA Act''. SEC. 2. ALLOWING CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS TO RECEIVE THE RESULTS OF VISA PETITIONS. Section 214(c)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(3)) is amended-- (1) by striking ``Attorney General'' each place it appears and inserting ``Secretary of Homeland Security''; and (2) in the first sentence of the matter following subparagraph (B)-- (A) by striking ``and (iv)'' and inserting ``(iv)''; and (B) by striking the period at the end and inserting the following: ``, and (v) upon making the decision, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the decision to each organization with which the Secretary consulted under subparagraph (A) or (B).''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters). general leave Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 3636, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California? There was no objection. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank Mr. Nadler and all of the other cosponsors in their helping to advance H.R. 3636, the Oversee Visa Integrity with Stakeholder Advisories Act, otherwise referred to as the O-VISA Act, for a floor vote. Congress established the O visa program to allow non-immigrants with extraordinary abilities to be employed in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. In recognition of the unique nature of the motion picture and television industry, Congress established special evidentiary criteria for O-1 and O-2 visas for artists who are working in the industry. One requirement mandates that the USCIS consult with the appropriate labor and management organizations for each visa petition. The reason for this is very simple in that those organizations are best suited to evaluate whether a visa applicant has demonstrated extraordinary achievement--the standard for O-1 and O-2 visa petitioners in this industry. These consulting organizations dedicate substantial resources to advise the USCIS on the merits of visa petitions. They are essential to identifying fraud as well as to protecting U.S. workers who are capable of filling those jobs. Unfortunately, these organizations are never notified as to the USCIS' final petition decisions. The consulting organizations should be notified of these decisions so that they may better assist the USCIS in determining fraud and in properly implementing the O visa standards. There have been serious indications of fraud in O-1 and O-2 visa petitions, including the outright forgery of advisory opinions, shell production companies, and sponsoring employers who are without any connection to the motion picture and television industry. These concerns led Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers to send a letter to the USCIS in 2014, which stated: It seems that, at the very least, USCIS should be notifying these organizations when it approves petitions over their objections. However, we are told that such organizations are rarely, if ever, notified regarding the outcome of petitions to which they object. Ensuring transparency in the adjudication process for any visa program is essential to a secure and effective immigration policy, and, therefore, we are concerned about the reported potential fraud in O-1 and O-2 visa petitions. It is important to note that there are no indications of abuse by the major studios, such as members of the MPAA. In fact, it is my understanding that the labor and management consulting organizations concur with the vast majority of O visa petitions that are submitted by the major studios. The O-VISA Act, which Mr. Nadler and I have put forth, is a narrow provision that injects transparency into this visa petition process. It amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide a copy of the USCIS visa petition decision to the consulting organization that was required to provide the advisory opinion for that specific petition. Essentially, the organization will be copied on the agency decision. Congress wisely recognized that the opinions of these private stakeholders deserve proper consideration due to their unique expertise in the industry. Congress should further utilize that expertise by authorizing the USCIS to copy these organizations because this will assist in identifying fraud and in protecting American jobs. I was pleased to receive the recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that H.R. 3636 will have no significant cost to the taxpayer. In fact, any associated costs will be recouped from fees that are collected by the Department of Homeland Security in the visa application process. Simply put, H.R. 3636 is a model of commonsense, bipartisan legislation that utilizes private sector expertise to improve our governance. I will take this opportunity to note that there are other issues regarding O visas that must be addressed. In particular, there are serious concerns that the USCIS' decisionmaking process moves far too slowly. This lack of efficiency means that film and television face considerable delays and unnecessary costs. I am committed to working with the committee and the industry to address these issues in the future. [[Page H3720]] I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3636, the O-VISA Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to support the O-VISA Act, which is a narrow, but important, bill. I thank my Judiciary Committee colleagues--the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler)--for their bipartisan effort in introducing this legislation, which will bring needed transparency to the O visa petition process. For individuals who seek an O visa specifically to work on a motion picture or a television production, the law requires that an individual have a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement, which must be recognized in the field through extensive documentation. In recognizing the need to balance the demand for a global exchange of creative professionals with the need to prevent the displacement of American workers, current law requires that O visa petitioners provide a written advisory opinion from an appropriate labor organization regarding the beneficiary's qualifications. For example, when petitioning for a foreign director, a petitioner must seek an opinion from the Directors Guild of America. As experts in their fields, these labor organizations are in a great position to appraise a beneficiary's qualifications. This process is intended to ensure that only the most extraordinary and accomplished individuals are granted an O visa. The O-VISA Act requires that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services provide a copy of the agency decision to the labor union that is consulted as part of the petition when one seeks work in a motion picture or on television. By doing this, the bill will help ensure that the union consultation is a meaningful part of the agency adjudication, as required under current law; and it will bring transparency for employers, workers, and the organizations that represent them, which is always a good thing. I do believe, as the gentlewoman has indicated, we could do more in this area. For example, we should be providing for the portability of O-1 visa holders and others so they can move between jobs. Portability not only helps employers in the industry, but it also ensures that foreign workers aren't trapped in positions or are used to undercut the wages of U.S. workers. I hope that we can continue the bipartisan effort that produced this legislation to make further improvements to the O visa program. As indicated during the consideration of the bill in the Judiciary Committee, the language contained in this bill has been coupled with provisions that also make important changes to the O visa program that were included in the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform from the last Congress, which died here on the House side. That bill provided for portability; it removed redundancies; and it better aligned these programs with others that involved honorarium or appearance fees. I know that we are not doing an entire rewrite of the immigration laws at this juncture, but I am hopeful that we will continue to work on these further improvements as this chairman has indicated he would be interested in. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't say what we all know too well, which is that we have enormous problems in our immigration system. I hope that we can work together on real, substantial fixes on behalf of not just the movie industry--as important as that industry is--but for families, refugees, and employers in a range of industries, including agriculture and the high-skilled sector. Over the years, I have worked with friends on the other side of the aisle on immigration reforms, big and small, and I continue to stand ready to do so in the future. I thank the Speaker, the bill's authors, and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters). I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson). Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank the gentlewoman from California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3636, the Oversee Visa Integrity with Stakeholder Advisories Act, also known as the O-VISA Act. I support this bipartisan legislation because it will strengthen the role of labor unions in the O visa petition process, a process by which international artists and entertainers with extraordinary ability are brought to the United States. {time} 1730 As many of you may know, my home State of Georgia is one of the Nation's leading locations for film and television production. Since the State updated its tax laws, this industry has generated approximately $800 million annually in economic development, and it is credited with supporting about 11,000 jobs in Georgia. In June alone, there were more than 23 movies and TV shows being filmed in the State. And as more studios and production teams move to Georgia, the demand for international talent will continue to rise. While international audiences have a strong appreciation and demand for American movies, music, and other forms of entertainment, we also want talent from other countries to come to the United States for our enjoyment. In such instances, however, we must ensure that the immigration process effectively balances the needs of the entertainment industry while protecting the rights and interests of American workers.

there was no objection. mrs. mimi walters of california. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i thank mr. nadler and all of the other cosponsors in their helping to advance h.r. 3636, the oversee visa integrity with stakeholder advisories act, otherwise referred to as the o-visa act, for a floor vote. congress established the o visa program to allow non-immigrants with extraordinary abilities to be employed in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. in recognition of the unique nature of the motion picture and television industry, congress established special evidentiary criteria for o-1 and o-2 visas for artists who are working in the industry. one requirement mandates that the uscis consult with the appropriate labor and management organizations for each visa petition. the reason for this is very simple in that those organizations are best suited to evaluate whether a visa applicant has demonstrated extraordinary achievement--the standard for o-1 and o-2 visa petitioners in this industry. these consulting organizations dedicate substantial resources to advise the uscis on the merits of visa petitions. they are essential to identifying fraud as well as to protecting u.s. workers who are capable of filling those jobs. unfortunately, these organizations are never notified as to the uscis' final petition decisions. the consulting organizations should be notified of these decisions so that they may better assist the uscis in determining fraud and in properly implementing the o visa standards. there have been serious indications of fraud in o-1 and o-2 visa petitions, including the outright forgery of advisory opinions, shell production companies, and sponsoring employers who are without any connection to the motion picture and television industry. these concerns led chairman goodlatte and ranking member conyers to send a letter to the uscis in 2014, which stated: it seems that, at the very least, uscis should be notifying these organizations when it approves petitions over their objections. however, we are told that such organizations are rarely, if ever, notified regarding the outcome of petitions to which they object. ensuring transparency in the adjudication process for any visa program is essential to a secure and effective immigration policy, and, therefore, we are concerned about the reported potential fraud in o-1 and o-2 visa petitions. it is important to note that there are no indications of abuse by the major studios, such as members of the mpaa. in fact, it is my understanding that the labor and management consulting organizations concur with the vast majority of o visa petitions that are submitted by the major studios. the o-visa act, which mr. nadler and i have put forth, is a narrow provision that injects transparency into this visa petition process. it amends the immigration and nationality act to require the secretary of homeland security to provide a copy of the uscis visa petition decision to the consulting organization that was required to provide the advisory opinion for that specific petition. essentially, the organization will be copied on the agency decision. congress wisely recognized that the opinions of these private stakeholders deserve proper consideration due to their unique expertise in the industry. congress should further utilize that expertise by authorizing the uscis to copy these organizations because this will assist in identifying fraud and in protecting american jobs. i was pleased to receive the recent report from the nonpartisan congressional budget office that h.r. 3636 will have no significant cost to the taxpayer. in fact, any associated costs will be recouped from fees that are collected by the department of homeland security in the visa application process. simply put, h.r. 3636 is a model of commonsense, bipartisan legislation that utilizes private sector expertise to improve our governance. i will take this opportunity to note that there are other issues regarding o visas that must be addressed. in particular, there are serious concerns that the uscis' decisionmaking process moves far too slowly. this lack of efficiency means that film and television face considerable delays and unnecessary costs. i am committed to working with the committee and the industry to address these issues in the future. [[page h3720]] i encourage my colleagues to support h.r. 3636, the o-visa act. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. lofgren. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i am pleased to support the o-visa act, which is a narrow, but important, bill. i thank my judiciary committee colleagues--the gentlewoman from california (mrs. mimi walters) and the gentleman from new york (mr. nadler)--for their bipartisan effort in introducing this legislation, which will bring needed transparency to the o visa petition process. for individuals who seek an o visa specifically to work on a motion picture or a television production, the law requires that an individual have a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement, which must be recognized in the field through extensive documentation. in recognizing the need to balance the demand for a global exchange of creative professionals with the need to prevent the displacement of american workers, current law requires that o visa petitioners provide a written advisory opinion from an appropriate labor organization regarding the beneficiary's qualifications. for example, when petitioning for a foreign director, a petitioner must seek an opinion from the directors guild of america. as experts in their fields, these labor organizations are in a great position to appraise a beneficiary's qualifications. this process is intended to ensure that only the most extraordinary and accomplished individuals are granted an o visa. the o-visa act requires that the u.s. citizenship and immigration services provide a copy of the agency decision to the labor union that is consulted as part of the petition when one seeks work in a motion picture or on television. by doing this, the bill will help ensure that the union consultation is a meaningful part of the agency adjudication, as required under current law; and it will bring transparency for employers, workers, and the organizations that represent them, which is always a good thing. i do believe, as the gentlewoman has indicated, we could do more in this area. for example, we should be providing for the portability of o-1 visa holders and others so they can move between jobs. portability not only helps employers in the industry, but it also ensures that foreign workers aren't trapped in positions or are used to undercut the wages of u.s. workers. i hope that we can continue the bipartisan effort that produced this legislation to make further improvements to the o visa program. as indicated during the consideration of the bill in the judiciary committee, the language contained in this bill has been coupled with provisions that also make important changes to the o visa program that were included in the senate's comprehensive immigration reform from the last congress, which died here on the house side. that bill provided for portability; it removed redundancies; and it better aligned these programs with others that involved honorarium or appearance fees. i know that we are not doing an entire rewrite of the immigration laws at this juncture, but i am hopeful that we will continue to work on these further improvements as this chairman has indicated he would be interested in. finally, i would be remiss if i didn't say what we all know too well, which is that we have enormous problems in our immigration system. i hope that we can work together on real, substantial fixes on behalf of not just the movie industry--as important as that industry is--but for families, refugees, and employers in a range of industries, including agriculture and the high-skilled sector. over the years, i have worked with friends on the other side of the aisle on immigration reforms, big and small, and i continue to stand ready to do so in the future. i thank the speaker, the bill's authors, and the gentlewoman from california (mrs. mimi walters). i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. mimi walters of california. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. lofgren. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from georgia (mr. johnson). mr. johnson of georgia. i thank the gentlewoman from california. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 3636, the oversee visa integrity with stakeholder advisories act, also known as the o-visa act. i support this bipartisan legislation because it will strengthen the role of labor unions in the o visa petition process, a process by which international artists and entertainers with extraordinary ability are brought to the united states. {time} 1730 as many of you may know, my home state of georgia is one of the nation's leading locations for film and television production. since the state updated its tax laws, this industry has generated approximately $800 million annually in economic development, and it is credited with supporting about 11,000 jobs in georgia. in june alone, there were more than 23 movies and tv shows being filmed in the state. and as more studios and production teams move to georgia, the demand for international talent will continue to rise. while international audiences have a strong appreciation and demand for american movies, music, and other forms of entertainment, we also want talent from other countries to come to the united states for our enjoyment. in such instances, however, we must ensure that the immigration process effectively balances the needs of the entertainment industry while protecting the rights and interests of american workers. congress has long realized that this is a delicate balance, which is why we created a specific role for american labor unions to participate in the o visa petition process for foreign artists and entertainers. unions help ensure safe working conditions and fair wages for all, regardless of nationality. under the o visa consultation process, unions provide informed opinions on these significant issues. the bill before us today makes an important change to current law. it requires the u.s. citizenship and immigration services to provide labor organizations the results of decisions for cases in which they submitted advisory opinions. this new requirement will bring transparency to the o visa process. in addition, this measure will enable labor unions to better monitor the outcomes of o visa cases and reduce uncertainty about the number of entertainment jobs filled by international artists. h.r. 3636 will further strengthen international artistic exchange while promoting american workers. in closing, i want to thank my colleagues on the judiciary committee, representatives mimi walters and jerrold nadler, for their leadership in crafting this bipartisan legislation. h.r. 3636 is a good bill, and i am pleased to support it. mrs. mimi walters of california. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. lofgren. mr. speaker, i have no further speakers. i urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill. i yield back the balance of my time. mrs. mimi walters of california. mr. speaker, i will close by thanking everyone for their support of this bill. i encourage my colleagues to support h.r. 3636, the o-visa act. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. nadler. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 3636, the o-visa act. as the lead democratic cosponsor, i also want to thank the gentlewoman from california, mrs. walters, for introducing this legislation, which will bring some needed transparency to the o visa application process. o visas are reserved for individuals with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics to perform temporary work in their field here in the united states. for those seeking an o visa specifically to work on a motion picture or television production, the law requires that an individual have ``a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement,'' which must be ``recognized in the field through extensive documentation.'' through a unique provision in the law, an applicant for an o visa seeking to work on a film or television production must first obtain an opinion from the relevant labor organization in their field. for example, a director must seek an opinion from the directors guild of america, and a set designer must consult with the international alliance of theatrical stage employees. as experts in their field, these organizations are in the best position to determine an applicant's special qualifications. this process is intended to ensure that only the [[page h3721]] most extraordinary and accomplished individuals--those who are so unique that they could not be replaced by an american worker--are granted an o visa. unfortunately, in recent years, several unions have expressed deep concerns that a significant number of applicants for whom they have recommended denial have been admitted into the united states nonetheless. in some instances, the unions have documented fraud on the part of the applicant, while in some cases, the government simply reached a different conclusion. but, because the consulting union is never informed by the government whether a particular application was approved or denied, it is impossible to know the full extent of this problem. the o-visa act would bring needed transparency to this process by requiring uscis to provide a copy of any final determination to the consulting union. this is a narrow, but critically important provision. although the unions have expended a great deal of resources to discover the outcome of their advisory opinions, they are in the dark about the vast majority of cases. although they could serve as a partner to uscis in rooting out fraud and abuse, they lack the information they need to follow up on suspicious cases. i should point out that the unions have assured me that their concerns about fraud do not stem from any applications by the major studios. the problems occur with certain unscrupulous independent companies that abuse the process in a variety of ways. of course, there need not be any fraud for uscis to reach a different conclusion about the merits of a particular applicant. but, if this is occurring in a significant number of cases, it may signify a systemic problem in how the agency is considering applications, or a lack of understanding by the union of how cases should be evaluated. in either case, it is only fair that the unions have sufficient knowledge of how petitions are decided so that they can have a meaningful discussion with uscis about any concerns they may have. the o-visa act would provide the transparency necessary to undertake this process and i urge my colleagues to support it. i want to note that since this bill simply requires that uscis provide a copy of any final decision to the consulting organization, it should not burden the agency or add any delays in processing o visa applications. however, i recognize that many sponsoring employers have expressed concerns over the inefficiency of the current process, and that reforms are needed to streamline the application process. the language contained in h.r. 3636 has historically been coupled with provisions that also make important changes to the o- and b- visa programs for those seeking entry for motion picture and television productions. these provisions were included in such bills as the senate's comprehensive immigration reform legislation from last congress. specifically, these changes provided the same commonsense portability that exists in other visa categories, removed redundancies in the consultation process, and better aligned these entry programs with others that might involve an honorarium or appearance fee. i appreciate chairman goodlatte's assurances during the markup on the o-visa act that he intends to address these commonsense changes to the o- and b-programs that have historically accompanied the provisions in this bill in the future. and i am pleased that we are advancing this bill today. the o-visa act will help ensure the integrity of the o visa program while protecting the jobs of american artists and craftsmen in the film and television industries. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i am pleased to support h.r. 3636, the ``oversee visa integrity with stakeholder advisories act'', also known as the o-visa act. h.r. 3636 is an important bill that supports the need and aim for comprehensive immigration reform and strengthens the role of the labor unions in the o-lb consultation process. h.r. 3636 would strengthen the role of the labor unions in the o-1b consultation process by amending the ``immigration and nationality act'' to require u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis) to provide a copy of the o-1b petition decision to the labor union that was consulted as part of the petition process for a foreign artists and performers seeking to work in the united states. this bill would also require an annual report to congress from the department of homeland security (dhs) enumerating the adjudicative outcomes of o-1b petitions with a focus on the relationship between the uscis decision and the recommendation provided in the labor union consultation. although h.r. 3636 deals specifically with the o-1b visa, the o nonimmigrant classification is commonly sub-classified in the following categories: o-1a: individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry); o-1b: individuals with an extraordinary ability in the arts or extraordinary achievement in motion picture or television industry; and o-2: individuals who will accompany an o-1, artist or athlete, to asset in a specific event or performance. for an o-1a, the o-2's assistance must be an ``integral part'' of the o-1a's activity. for an o-1b, the o-2's assistance must be ``essential'' to the completion of the o-1b's production. the o-2 worker has critical skills and experience with the o-1 that cannot be readily performed by a u.s. worker and which are essential to the successful performance of the o-1. in creating the o-1b visa category, congress sought a balance between the need for global interchange of creative professionals, and the need to prevent entertainment producers from abusing the immigration laws and the ability of individuals to obtain a visa for extraordinary ability. in doing so, congress created the o nonimmigrant visa, pursuant to an amendment to the immigration act of 1990 (immact), for individuals who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, or who have a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry and have been recognized nationally or internationally for those achievements. the changes under immact led to unintended conflicts between labor and management in the industry. labor and management reached a settlement, reflected in current law and regulations that give weight, but not control, to labor union advisory opinions of the abilities and professional prestige of foreign artists and performers sought by industry management. by requiring that uscis provide a copy of the 0-1b petition decision to the labor union that was consulted, h.r. 3636 will provide labor unions with important data allowing them to see how their consultations are used by the adjudication agency. h.r. 3636 will reinforce the labor union's position in the adjudication process and lay the groundwork for further legislative action if the newly provided information suggests that more reform is warranted. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from california (mrs. mimi walters) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3636, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. the title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``a bill to amend the immigration and nationality act to allow labor organizations and management organizations to receive the results of visa petitions about which such organizations have submitted advisory opinions.''. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",22774

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. This is the United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act. It is authored by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the committee's ranking member. As always, I appreciate him working closely with Chairman Emeritus Ileana Ros-Lehtinen to ensure this legislation's swift passage. These two Members have been particularly committed to developments in our Southern Hemisphere. For over a decade, Caribbean nations have received subsidized Venezuelan oil in exchange for their support of the authoritarian government of Hugo Chavez and now Nicolas Maduro. However, subsidized Venezuelan oil has done nothing to help the Caribbean address their need for a diversified energy strategy and instead has kept much of the region beholden to the Venezuelan strongmen. With Venezuela's inflation rate expected to rise to 500 percent this year, fueled partially by the low price of oil, the nations of the Caribbean have seen a marked decrease in oil shipments. Meanwhile, years of authoritarian socialism are coming to a head in Venezuela, as the political and economic crisis there threatens almost certain implosion. This presents an important responsibility here, a responsibility for the United States to finally develop a comprehensive strategy on how best to engage nations of the Caribbean diplomatically, how to help the region improve energy security, how to reduce violence and drug trafficking, and advance cooperation with regional governments on democracy and human rights in international organizations, particularly in the Organization of American States, as we know it, the OAS. So this legislation, authored by Eliot Engel, will require the State Department and USAID to develop that comprehensive and clear strategy on how best to engage the Caribbean region, and it also requires the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative so that we can be sure we are truly advancing our interests in the region using the best and most efficient approach. During this time of competing priorities and limited resources, this bill seeks to ensure that our government is not neglecting this key region so close to our shores; and, frankly, it is in our hemisphere, so we should not neglect it while developing a strategy that ensures the effectiveness of our diplomatic engagement with each Caribbean nation. I once again thank the author, Ranking Member Engel, for his leadership and attention to the Western Hemisphere and thank Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for her commitment as well, specifically to the Caribbean Basin. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time and yield the remainder of my time to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and ask unanimous consent that she be allowed to manage that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank Chairman Royce and my good friend Mr. Engel for their continued leadership, both of these great leaders, their longstanding engagement to greater engagement with the Caribbean and for introducing this bill that we have before us today, H.R. 4939, the United States- Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act. I am also pleased to be an original cosponsor and the Republican lead of Mr. Engel's legislation. I thank Mr. Engel. It is fitting that we bring this bill to the floor today, Mr. Speaker, during National Caribbean American Heritage Month. As a Member from south Florida, I see firsthand the wonderful contributions that Caribbean Americans have made to our local communities. The Caribbean culture has had a great and lasting impact on our country and has helped bolster our society and has enriched our traditions. But while we celebrate the contributions of the Caribbean American community to our country, we must also dedicate ourselves to doing more to enhance our relations with our neighbors. U.S. foreign policy in recent administrations--be they Republican or Democratic--have not strengthened our partnerships with the Caribbean in the right way. As the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), our chairman, pointed out, our influence and friendship with these nations has waned, allowing the negative influence of the dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela to take root in the Caribbean. Deepening our strategic relationship with the Caribbean represents an extraordinary opportunity to expand our economic ties, to cooperate on security issues, and to advance our values, our interests at institutions such as the OAS, the Organization of American States, and the U.N., the United Nations. That is why, Mr. Speaker, this bill is so important. It pushes the State Department to prioritize our relations [[Page H3726]] with the Caribbean nations. It requires our State Department to develop a strategy to partner with our friends in the region on all issues, from counternarcotics efforts, to energy security, to everything. There is great potential for energy in the Caribbean, for example, but we must help nations break from their dependency on Venezuelan energy, especially as the Maduro regime is leading that nation to total chaos. We should help our neighbors take advantage of abundant and cheap natural gas and new, advanced, clean wind and solar technologies. In this way, we can help strengthen the economies of the region from the impact of the Venezuelan collapse--because the collapse is coming, Mr. Speaker--and take realistic steps toward reducing carbon emissions. This engagement has the benefit of being positive and sound foreign policy, but it is also great for our domestic policy. This bill will broaden our outreach to the Caribbean diaspora community here in the United States, which has been so instrumental in helping to shape and influence our great American story, and they deserve recognition and greater collaboration. I urge my colleagues to give their strong support for this bill. I thank Ranking Member Engel for his leadership, as well as Chairman Royce, on this important initiative. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which I was proud to introduce, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank our chairman, Ed Royce, for bringing forward my legislation to ramp up our country's engagement with our Caribbean neighbors. I also want to thank our former chair, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who joined me in offering this bill and who knows better than anyone the strategic importance of the Caribbean region. We spend a great deal of time focusing on challenges and opportunities in faraway places, but it is important that we never lose sight of our interests closer to home. Indeed, we should be working to strengthen our ties with countries in the Caribbean. That is the aim of this bill, which would prioritize U.S.-Caribbean relations for years to come. This bill would require the Secretary of State, along with the USAID Administrator, to devise a multiyear strategy for Caribbean engagement. {time} 1800 We want to see how our diplomatic and development efforts are focused on the Caribbean, with particular attention to energy security, the rule of law, efforts to combat drug trafficking, and ways to enhance economic cooperation. We also want to increase our engagement when it comes to regional issues by improving our diplomatic efforts with respect to key votes at the United Nations and the Organization of American States. In my view, the best way to put together a new strategy toward the Caribbean is to tap into the large and vibrant Caribbean American community here in the United States. I did that for the 4 years that I was chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee. So this bill underscores the importance of consulting with the Caribbean diaspora community, promoting their involvement in economic development, and civilian security in the Caribbean. Finally, H.R. 4939 commissions two reports from the Government Accountability Office, or GAO--one which evaluates the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative and another which assesses U.S. diplomatic engagement in the eastern Caribbean. I have long believed that we do a real disservice to our country by having no physical diplomatic presence in five of the countries in the eastern Caribbean: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. I have long said it makes no sense for us to continue to conduct diplomacy on these islands from our embassy in Barbados. They say you can't conduct diplomacy from a bunker. It is also true that you cannot conduct diplomacy from hundreds of miles away. I hope to work with the State Department to ensure that we establish a diplomatic presence in the eastern Caribbean as soon as possible. China has it. Venezuela has it. Others have it. We should have it. It is especially appropriate that we are considering this bill in June, which is National Caribbean American Heritage Month. As the President said in his proclamation: ``The bonds between the United States and the Caribbean remain strong. Both rooted in similar legacies--of trial and triumph, oppression and liberation--our narratives have advanced on a similar path of progress, driven forward by our shared dedication to fostering opportunity and forging a brighter future.'' I couldn't agree more. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), a leader on the Caribbean and author of a resolution honoring Caribbean American Heritage Month. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, let me take a moment to offer my condolences and prayers to the families and victims of the horrific gun violence against the LGBT community in Orlando. These despicable acts have shattered the lives of so many people. Our response must be not only in words, but also in deeds and in action. My congressional district has and will continue its outpouring of sympathy and support for the people of Orlando, and we stand ready to assist in whatever way is needed. Let me now take a moment to thank Chairman Royce and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. I also thank Congressman Engel for yielding and for his tremendous leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee. I had the honor to serve on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee for several years when Mr. Engel was chair. We talked early on about the importance of the Caribbean as a region and how we must make it a priority in our foreign policy. So today I want to thank both sides: our ranking member, Chairman Royce, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and especially Mr. Engel, for not just their words, but also their tremendous leadership, as demonstrated by this important bill. It has taken a while to get to this point, but thank goodness we are doing this in a bipartisan way. So I just want to thank them very much for that. As a lead cosponsor, of course, I stand in strong support of H.R. 4939. The bill would enhance U.S.-Caribbean relationships by requiring the Secretary of State, in coordination with the administrator of USAID, to submit a multiyear strategy for U.S. engagement with our Caribbean neighbors to Congress. I just want to, again, thank both sides. I remember when we had to work to really get the Caribbean to be included in all PEPFAR legislation, programs, and funding. So that was a major step in the right direction. This is a huge step now in moving forward. This bill is very timely. It is a very important bill. As a long-time supporter of the Caribbean and a frequent visitor to the region--actually, my son attended school in Grenada. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. LEE. As I said, my son attended school in Grenada, and I am a frequent visitor to the region. So I am very proud to see us debate this today and, hopefully, pass the bill again on June 13. Congress unanimously passed H. Con. Res. 71, which Mr. Engel and Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen referenced. I authored that, actually, in February 2006, when President Bush was in office. He signed it. Since then, President Obama has issued a proclamation annually recognizing June as Caribbean American Heritage Month. Caribbean Americans have contributed immensely to the fabric of the United States. So as we celebrate this month, we are reminded also of the relationship between the United States and our Caribbean neighbors. This bill does that and more. [[Page H3727]] H.R. 4939 strengthens and enhances ties between the U.S. and the Caribbean by promoting energy sustainability, diplomatic relations, and economic cooperation. Caribbean countries, unfortunately, have been neglected in our foreign policy. This bill brings a focus on making the Caribbean region and the West Indies a priority. So, Mr. Speaker, now is the time for the United States to recommit our strong priorities with our Caribbean neighbors. We must revitalize and enhance our outreach to our Caribbean neighbors now and in the future. This bill does just that. I urge an ``aye'' vote. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a very valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, before I begin my remarks, I, too, extend my prayers and sympathy to the people of Orlando. My constituents, like all Americans, are brokenhearted at this monstrous act of violence visited upon a community gathered together to enjoy friendship and community and to celebrate. This act of cowardice has caused so much pain to the LGBT community in Orlando and to our community all across this country. I know I speak for everyone when I say we stand ready to do everything that we can to help this community heal and to keep our communities safe. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4939, the United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act of 2016. My home State of Rhode Island is home to many Caribbean Americans, particularly from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and other countries in the region. It is critical to strengthen our relationship with these countries not just because of the national security interests we share, but also to support the interests of our constituents and their ties to this region. Geographic proximity has ensured strong linkages between the United States and the Caribbean region. H.R. 4939 will further enhance this relationship. Our interests in the regions are diverse, including economic, political, and security concerns. Despite its importance to the United States, the Caribbean often gets overlooked as we deal with concerns and threats from other regions of the world. Our Caribbean neighbors are important partners at the United Nations and the Organization of American States. Increasing engagements with the governments and the Caribbean diaspora in the United States, as well as the private sector and civil society in both the United States and the Caribbean, will be beneficial to everyone. H.R. 4939 will enhance diplomatic relations, increase economic cooperation, support security integration efforts to help reduce violence and drug trafficking, advance cooperation on democracy and human rights in the region and at multilateral fora, and enhance cooperation in combating public health threats. I want to end by thanking Ranking Member Engel, Chairman Royce, and subcommittee chair Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and all the sponsors of this important bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in April of 2009, I had the honor of joining President Obama in Trinidad and Tobago for the Summit of the Americas. That was one of his first trips abroad as President. I was chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee at the time. At that time, the President said: ``The energy, the dynamism, the diversity of the Caribbean people inspires us all, and are such an important part of what we share in common as a hemisphere.'' Seven years later, those words continue to ring true. In that time, we have made a lot of progress. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative and the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative have brought us closer to our Caribbean partners on a range of shared concerns. Let me say that Vice President Biden deserves a great deal of credit for this progress, but more needs to be done. For example, this week, Secretary Kerry is in the Dominican Republic for the general assembly meeting of the OAS, the Organization of American States, which has its headquarters right here in Washington, D.C. We are confronting some serious issues at this meeting, including the crisis in Venezuela. The Caribbean countries represented there will play a major role, and the more we work in partnership with these governments, the better. These may be small countries, but they pack a big punch in what is going on in our neighborhood. This legislation will keep us moving in the right direction when it comes to these partnerships. I was very honored to introduce the bill, and I am honored that we have strong support on both sides of the aisle. I, again, want to thank Chairman Royce and Chairwoman Emeritus Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both excellent members and real, stalwart support for this committee. This is another example of bipartisanship on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I am very, very proud of that. So this will keep us moving in the right direction. I urge a ``yes'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I thank, once again, Ranking Member Engel for his tremendous leadership and all of his efforts to promote stronger relationships with nations within our own hemisphere. I have the distinct pleasure, as I have said, to represent south Florida in Congress. We have many, many constituents in my district from the Caribbean. Part of what makes south Florida so unique is the contribution of the Caribbean diaspora. What we have here during Caribbean American Heritage Month is an opportunity to strengthen the U.S.-Caribbean alliance and contribute in a meaningful and positive way to our neighbors. We have been in a crisis mode, Mr. Speaker, focusing most of our attention on the many areas that, rightfully, demand our attention overseas, but it would be in both of our long-term interests, as well as our near-term interests, to develop mutually beneficial and strategic alliances close to home with the Caribbean nations. Just think of all the economic opportunities that we can help in working with our neighbors to open up. We have a great opportunity with this bill to help them diversify their economies by tearing down burdensome barriers that are preventing them from taking advantage of direct foreign investment and trade. That can lead to greater growth, more stability for the Caribbean, for the diaspora, and for the United States as a whole. So I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important bill. I look forward to continuing to work with Mr. Engel and Mr. Royce to develop even stronger ties to our neighbors in the hemisphere. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4939, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3724-H3727] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] UNITED STATES-CARIBBEAN STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT ACT OF 2016 Mr. ROYCE.

SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. In this Act: (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.

(3) Security assistance.--The term ``security assistance'' has the meaning given such term in section 502B(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2304(d)). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. This is the United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act. It is authored by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the committee's ranking member. As always, I appreciate him working closely with Chairman Emeritus Ileana Ros-Lehtinen to ensure this legislation's swift passage. These two Members have been particularly committed to developments in our Southern Hemisphere. For over a decade, Caribbean nations have received subsidized Venezuelan oil in exchange for their support of the authoritarian government of Hugo Chavez and now Nicolas Maduro. However, subsidized Venezuelan oil has done nothing to help the Caribbean address their need for a diversified energy strategy and instead has kept much of the region beholden to the Venezuelan strongmen. With Venezuela's inflation rate expected to rise to 500 percent this year, fueled partially by the low price of oil, the nations of the Caribbean have seen a marked decrease in oil shipments. Meanwhile, years of authoritarian socialism are coming to a head in Venezuela, as the political and economic crisis there threatens almost certain implosion. This presents an important responsibility here, a responsibility for the United States to finally develop a comprehensive strategy on how best to engage nations of the Caribbean diplomatically, how to help the region improve energy security, how to reduce violence and drug trafficking, and advance cooperation with regional governments on democracy and human rights in international organizations, particularly in the Organization of American States, as we know it, the OAS. So this legislation, authored by Eliot Engel, will require the State Department and USAID to develop that comprehensive and clear strategy on how best to engage the Caribbean region, and it also requires the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative so that we can be sure we are truly advancing our interests in the region using the best and most efficient approach. During this time of competing priorities and limited resources, this bill seeks to ensure that our government is not neglecting this key region so close to our shores; and, frankly, it is in our hemisphere, so we should not neglect it while developing a strategy that ensures the effectiveness of our diplomatic engagement with each Caribbean nation. I once again thank the author, Ranking Member Engel, for his leadership and attention to the Western Hemisphere and thank Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for her commitment as well, specifically to the Caribbean Basin. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time and yield the remainder of my time to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and ask unanimous consent that she be allowed to manage that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank Chairman Royce and my good friend Mr. Engel for their continued leadership, both of these great leaders, their longstanding engagement to greater engagement with the Caribbean and for introducing this bill that we have before us today, H.R. 4939, the United States- Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act. I am also pleased to be an original cosponsor and the Republican lead of Mr. Engel's legislation. I thank Mr. Engel. It is fitting that we bring this bill to the floor today, Mr. Speaker, during National Caribbean American Heritage Month. As a Member from south Florida, I see firsthand the wonderful contributions that Caribbean Americans have made to our local communities. The Caribbean culture has had a great and lasting impact on our country and has helped bolster our society and has enriched our traditions. But while we celebrate the contributions of the Caribbean American community to our country, we must also dedicate ourselves to doing more to enhance our relations with our neighbors. U.S. foreign policy in recent administrations--be they Republican or Democratic--have not strengthened our partnerships with the Caribbean in the right way. As the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), our chairman, pointed out, our influence and friendship with these nations has waned, allowing the negative influence of the dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela to take root in the Caribbean. Deepening our strategic relationship with the Caribbean represents an extraordinary opportunity to expand our economic ties, to cooperate on security issues, and to advance our values, our interests at institutions such as the OAS, the Organization of American States, and the U.N., the United Nations. That is why, Mr. Speaker, this bill is so important. It pushes the State Department to prioritize our relations [[Page H3726]] with the Caribbean nations. It requires our State Department to develop a strategy to partner with our friends in the region on all issues, from counternarcotics efforts, to energy security, to everything. There is great potential for energy in the Caribbean, for example, but we must help nations break from their dependency on Venezuelan energy, especially as the Maduro regime is leading that nation to total chaos. We should help our neighbors take advantage of abundant and cheap natural gas and new, advanced, clean wind and solar technologies. In this way, we can help strengthen the economies of the region from the impact of the Venezuelan collapse--because the collapse is coming, Mr. Speaker--and take realistic steps toward reducing carbon emissions. This engagement has the benefit of being positive and sound foreign policy, but it is also great for our domestic policy. This bill will broaden our outreach to the Caribbean diaspora community here in the United States, which has been so instrumental in helping to shape and influence our great American story, and they deserve recognition and greater collaboration. I urge my colleagues to give their strong support for this bill. I thank Ranking Member Engel for his leadership, as well as Chairman Royce, on this important initiative. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which I was proud to introduce, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank our chairman, Ed Royce, for bringing forward my legislation to ramp up our country's engagement with our Caribbean neighbors. I also want to thank our former chair, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who joined me in offering this bill and who knows better than anyone the strategic importance of the Caribbean region. We spend a great deal of time focusing on challenges and opportunities in faraway places, but it is important that we never lose sight of our interests closer to home. Indeed, we should be working to strengthen our ties with countries in the Caribbean. That is the aim of this bill, which would prioritize U.S.-Caribbean relations for years to come. This bill would require the Secretary of State, along with the USAID Administrator, to devise a multiyear strategy for Caribbean engagement. {time} 1800 We want to see how our diplomatic and development efforts are focused on the Caribbean, with particular attention to energy security, the rule of law, efforts to combat drug trafficking, and ways to enhance economic cooperation.

I did that for the 4 years that I was chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee. So this bill underscores the importance of consulting with the Caribbean diaspora community, promoting their involvement in economic development, and civilian security in the Caribbean.

That was one of his first trips abroad as President. I was chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee at the time. At that time, the President said: ``The energy, the dynamism, the diversity of the Caribbean people inspires us all, and are such an important part of what we share in common as a hemisphere.'' Seven years later, those words continue to ring true. In that time, we have made a lot of progress. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative and the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative have brought us closer to our Caribbean partners on a range of shared concerns. Let me say that Vice President Biden deserves a great deal of credit for this progress, but more needs to be done. For example, this week, Secretary Kerry is in the Dominican Republic for the general assembly meeting of the OAS, the Organization of American States, which has its headquarters right here in Washington, D.C. We are confronting some serious issues at this meeting, including the crisis in Venezuela. The Caribbean countries represented there will play a major role, and the more we work in partnership with these governments, the better. These may be small countries, but they pack a big punch in what is going on in our neighborhood. This legislation will keep us moving in the right direction when it comes to these partnerships. I was very honored to introduce the bill, and I am honored that we have strong support on both sides of the aisle. I, again, want to thank Chairman Royce and Chairwoman Emeritus Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both excellent members and real, stalwart support for this committee. This is another example of bipartisanship on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I am very, very proud of that. So this will keep us moving in the right direction. I urge a ``yes'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I thank, once again, Ranking Member Engel for his tremendous leadership and all of his efforts to promote stronger relationships with nations within our own hemisphere. I have the distinct pleasure, as I have said, to represent south Florida in Congress. We have many, many constituents in my district from the Caribbean. Part of what makes south Florida so unique is the contribution of the Caribbean diaspora. What we have here during Caribbean American Heritage Month is an opportunity to strengthen the U.S.-Caribbean alliance and contribute in a meaningful and positive way to our neighbors. We have been in a crisis mode, Mr. Speaker, focusing most of our attention on the many areas that, rightfully, demand our attention overseas, but it would be in both of our long-term interests, as well as our near-term interests, to develop mutually beneficial and strategic alliances close to home with the Caribbean nations. Just think of all the economic opportunities that we can help in working with our neighbors to open up. We have a great opportunity with this bill to help them diversify their economies by tearing down burdensome barriers that are preventing them from taking advantage of direct foreign investment and trade. That can lead to greater growth, more stability for the Caribbean, for the diaspora, and for the United States as a whole. So I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important bill. I look forward to continuing to work with Mr. Engel and Mr. Royce to develop even stronger ties to our neighbors in the hemisphere. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4939, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3724-H3727] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] UNITED STATES-CARIBBEAN STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT ACT OF 2016 Mr. ROYCE.

SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. This is the United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act. It is authored by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the committee's ranking member. As always, I appreciate him working closely with Chairman Emeritus Ileana Ros-Lehtinen to ensure this legislation's swift passage. These two Members have been particularly committed to developments in our Southern Hemisphere. For over a decade, Caribbean nations have received subsidized Venezuelan oil in exchange for their support of the authoritarian government of Hugo Chavez and now Nicolas Maduro. However, subsidized Venezuelan oil has done nothing to help the Caribbean address their need for a diversified energy strategy and instead has kept much of the region beholden to the Venezuelan strongmen. With Venezuela's inflation rate expected to rise to 500 percent this year, fueled partially by the low price of oil, the nations of the Caribbean have seen a marked decrease in oil shipments. Meanwhile, years of authoritarian socialism are coming to a head in Venezuela, as the political and economic crisis there threatens almost certain implosion. This presents an important responsibility here, a responsibility for the United States to finally develop a comprehensive strategy on how best to engage nations of the Caribbean diplomatically, how to help the region improve energy security, how to reduce violence and drug trafficking, and advance cooperation with regional governments on democracy and human rights in international organizations, particularly in the Organization of American States, as we know it, the OAS. So this legislation, authored by Eliot Engel, will require the State Department and USAID to develop that comprehensive and clear strategy on how best to engage the Caribbean region, and it also requires the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative so that we can be sure we are truly advancing our interests in the region using the best and most efficient approach. During this time of competing priorities and limited resources, this bill seeks to ensure that our government is not neglecting this key region so close to our shores; and, frankly, it is in our hemisphere, so we should not neglect it while developing a strategy that ensures the effectiveness of our diplomatic engagement with each Caribbean nation. I once again thank the author, Ranking Member Engel, for his leadership and attention to the Western Hemisphere and thank Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for her commitment as well, specifically to the Caribbean Basin. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time and yield the remainder of my time to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and ask unanimous consent that she be allowed to manage that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank Chairman Royce and my good friend Mr. Engel for their continued leadership, both of these great leaders, their longstanding engagement to greater engagement with the Caribbean and for introducing this bill that we have before us today, H.R. 4939, the United States- Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act. I am also pleased to be an original cosponsor and the Republican lead of Mr. Engel's legislation. I thank Mr. Engel. It is fitting that we bring this bill to the floor today, Mr. Speaker, during National Caribbean American Heritage Month. As a Member from south Florida, I see firsthand the wonderful contributions that Caribbean Americans have made to our local communities. The Caribbean culture has had a great and lasting impact on our country and has helped bolster our society and has enriched our traditions. But while we celebrate the contributions of the Caribbean American community to our country, we must also dedicate ourselves to doing more to enhance our relations with our neighbors. U.S. foreign policy in recent administrations--be they Republican or Democratic--have not strengthened our partnerships with the Caribbean in the right way. As the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), our chairman, pointed out, our influence and friendship with these nations has waned, allowing the negative influence of the dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela to take root in the Caribbean. Deepening our strategic relationship with the Caribbean represents an extraordinary opportunity to expand our economic ties, to cooperate on security issues, and to advance our values, our interests at institutions such as the OAS, the Organization of American States, and the U.N., the United Nations. That is why, Mr. Speaker, this bill is so important. It pushes the State Department to prioritize our relations [[Page H3726]] with the Caribbean nations. It requires our State Department to develop a strategy to partner with our friends in the region on all issues, from counternarcotics efforts, to energy security, to everything. There is great potential for energy in the Caribbean, for example, but we must help nations break from their dependency on Venezuelan energy, especially as the Maduro regime is leading that nation to total chaos. We should help our neighbors take advantage of abundant and cheap natural gas and new, advanced, clean wind and solar technologies. In this way, we can help strengthen the economies of the region from the impact of the Venezuelan collapse--because the collapse is coming, Mr. Speaker--and take realistic steps toward reducing carbon emissions. This engagement has the benefit of being positive and sound foreign policy, but it is also great for our domestic policy. This bill will broaden our outreach to the Caribbean diaspora community here in the United States, which has been so instrumental in helping to shape and influence our great American story, and they deserve recognition and greater collaboration. I urge my colleagues to give their strong support for this bill. I thank Ranking Member Engel for his leadership, as well as Chairman Royce, on this important initiative. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which I was proud to introduce, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank our chairman, Ed Royce, for bringing forward my legislation to ramp up our country's engagement with our Caribbean neighbors. I also want to thank our former chair, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who joined me in offering this bill and who knows better than anyone the strategic importance of the Caribbean region. We spend a great deal of time focusing on challenges and opportunities in faraway places, but it is important that we never lose sight of our interests closer to home. Indeed, we should be working to strengthen our ties with countries in the Caribbean. That is the aim of this bill, which would prioritize U.S.-Caribbean relations for years to come. This bill would require the Secretary of State, along with the USAID Administrator, to devise a multiyear strategy for Caribbean engagement. {time} 1800 We want to see how our diplomatic and development efforts are focused on the Caribbean, with particular attention to energy security, the rule of law, efforts to combat drug trafficking, and ways to enhance economic cooperation. We also want to increase our engagement when it comes to regional issues by improving our diplomatic efforts with respect to key votes at the United Nations and the Organization of American States. In my view, the best way to put together a new strategy toward the Caribbean is to tap into the large and vibrant Caribbean American community here in the United States. I did that for the 4 years that I was chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee. So this bill underscores the importance of consulting with the Caribbean diaspora community, promoting their involvement in economic development, and civilian security in the Caribbean. Finally, H.R. 4939 commissions two reports from the Government Accountability Office, or GAO--one which evaluates the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative and another which assesses U.S. diplomatic engagement in the eastern Caribbean. I have long believed that we do a real disservice to our country by having no physical diplomatic presence in five of the countries in the eastern Caribbean: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. I have long said it makes no sense for us to continue to conduct diplomacy on these islands from our embassy in Barbados. They say you can't conduct diplomacy from a bunker. It is also true that you cannot conduct diplomacy from hundreds of miles away. I hope to work with the State Department to ensure that we establish a diplomatic presence in the eastern Caribbean as soon as possible. China has it. Venezuela has it. Others have it. We should have it. It is especially appropriate that we are considering this bill in June, which is National Caribbean American Heritage Month. As the President said in his proclamation: ``The bonds between the United States and the Caribbean remain strong. Both rooted in similar legacies--of trial and triumph, oppression and liberation--our narratives have advanced on a similar path of progress, driven forward by our shared dedication to fostering opportunity and forging a brighter future.'' I couldn't agree more. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), a leader on the Caribbean and author of a resolution honoring Caribbean American Heritage Month. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, let me take a moment to offer my condolences and prayers to the families and victims of the horrific gun violence against the LGBT community in Orlando. These despicable acts have shattered the lives of so many people. Our response must be not only in words, but also in deeds and in action. My congressional district has and will continue its outpouring of sympathy and support for the people of Orlando, and we stand ready to assist in whatever way is needed. Let me now take a moment to thank Chairman Royce and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. I also thank Congressman Engel for yielding and for his tremendous leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee. I had the honor to serve on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee for several years when Mr. Engel was chair. We talked early on about the importance of the Caribbean as a region and how we must make it a priority in our foreign policy. So today I want to thank both sides: our ranking member, Chairman Royce, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and especially Mr. Engel, for not just their words, but also their tremendous leadership, as demonstrated by this important bill. It has taken a while to get to this point, but thank goodness we are doing this in a bipartisan way. So I just want to thank them very much for that. As a lead cosponsor, of course, I stand in strong support of H.R. 4939. The bill would enhance U.S.-Caribbean relationships by requiring the Secretary of State, in coordination with the administrator of USAID, to submit a multiyear strategy for U.S. engagement with our Caribbean neighbors to Congress. I just want to, again, thank both sides. I remember when we had to work to really get the Caribbean to be included in all PEPFAR legislation, programs, and funding. So that was a major step in the right direction. This is a huge step now in moving forward. This bill is very timely. It is a very important bill. As a long-time supporter of the Caribbean and a frequent visitor to the region--actually, my son attended school in Grenada. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. LEE. As I said, my son attended school in Grenada, and I am a frequent visitor to the region. So I am very proud to see us debate this today and, hopefully, pass the bill again on June 13. Congress unanimously passed H. Con. Res. 71, which Mr. Engel and Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen referenced. I authored that, actually, in February 2006, when President Bush was in office. He signed it. Since then, President Obama has issued a proclamation annually recognizing June as Caribbean American Heritage Month. Caribbean Americans have contributed immensely to the fabric of the United States. So as we celebrate this month, we are reminded also of the relationship between the United States and our Caribbean neighbors. This bill does that and more. [[Page H3727]] H.R. 4939 strengthens and enhances ties between the U.S. and the Caribbean by promoting energy sustainability, diplomatic relations, and economic cooperation. Caribbean countries, unfortunately, have been neglected in our foreign policy. This bill brings a focus on making the Caribbean region and the West Indies a priority. So, Mr. Speaker, now is the time for the United States to recommit our strong priorities with our Caribbean neighbors. We must revitalize and enhance our outreach to our Caribbean neighbors now and in the future. This bill does just that. I urge an ``aye'' vote. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a very valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, before I begin my remarks, I, too, extend my prayers and sympathy to the people of Orlando. My constituents, like all Americans, are brokenhearted at this monstrous act of violence visited upon a community gathered together to enjoy friendship and community and to celebrate. This act of cowardice has caused so much pain to the LGBT community in Orlando and to our community all across this country. I know I speak for everyone when I say we stand ready to do everything that we can to help this community heal and to keep our communities safe. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4939, the United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act of 2016. My home State of Rhode Island is home to many Caribbean Americans, particularly from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and other countries in the region. It is critical to strengthen our relationship with these countries not just because of the national security interests we share, but also to support the interests of our constituents and their ties to this region. Geographic proximity has ensured strong linkages between the United States and the Caribbean region. H.R. 4939 will further enhance this relationship. Our interests in the regions are diverse, including economic, political, and security concerns. Despite its importance to the United States, the Caribbean often gets overlooked as we deal with concerns and threats from other regions of the world. Our Caribbean neighbors are important partners at the United Nations and the Organization of American States. Increasing engagements with the governments and the Caribbean diaspora in the United States, as well as the private sector and civil society in both the United States and the Caribbean, will be beneficial to everyone. H.R. 4939 will enhance diplomatic relations, increase economic cooperation, support security integration efforts to help reduce violence and drug trafficking, advance cooperation on democracy and human rights in the region and at multilateral fora, and enhance cooperation in combating public health threats. I want to end by thanking Ranking Member Engel, Chairman Royce, and subcommittee chair Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and all the sponsors of this important bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in April of 2009, I had the honor of joining President Obama in Trinidad and Tobago for the Summit of the Americas.

pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from california (mr. royce) and the gentleman from new york (mr. engel) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. general leave mr. royce. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this bill. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this bill. this is the united states-caribbean strategic engagement act. it is authored by the gentleman from new york (mr. engel), the committee's ranking member. as always, i appreciate him working closely with chairman emeritus ileana ros-lehtinen to ensure this legislation's swift passage. these two members have been particularly committed to developments in our southern hemisphere. for over a decade, caribbean nations have received subsidized venezuelan oil in exchange for their support of the authoritarian government of hugo chavez and now nicolas maduro. however, subsidized venezuelan oil has done nothing to help the caribbean address their need for a diversified energy strategy and instead has kept much of the region beholden to the venezuelan strongmen. with venezuela's inflation rate expected to rise to 500 percent this year, fueled partially by the low price of oil, the nations of the caribbean have seen a marked decrease in oil shipments. meanwhile, years of authoritarian socialism are coming to a head in venezuela, as the political and economic crisis there threatens almost certain implosion. this presents an important responsibility here, a responsibility for the united states to finally develop a comprehensive strategy on how best to engage nations of the caribbean diplomatically, how to help the region improve energy security, how to reduce violence and drug trafficking, and advance cooperation with regional governments on democracy and human rights in international organizations, particularly in the organization of american states, as we know it, the oas. so this legislation, authored by eliot engel, will require the state department and usaid to develop that comprehensive and clear strategy on how best to engage the caribbean region, and it also requires the government accountability office to evaluate the caribbean basin security initiative so that we can be sure we are truly advancing our interests in the region using the best and most efficient approach. during this time of competing priorities and limited resources, this bill seeks to ensure that our government is not neglecting this key region so close to our shores; and, frankly, it is in our hemisphere, so we should not neglect it while developing a strategy that ensures the effectiveness of our diplomatic engagement with each caribbean nation. i once again thank the author, ranking member engel, for his leadership and attention to the western hemisphere and thank ileana ros-lehtinen for her commitment as well, specifically to the caribbean basin. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time and yield the remainder of my time to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen) and ask unanimous consent that she be allowed to manage that time. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i thank chairman royce and my good friend mr. engel for their continued leadership, both of these great leaders, their longstanding engagement to greater engagement with the caribbean and for introducing this bill that we have before us today, h.r. 4939, the united states- caribbean strategic engagement act. i am also pleased to be an original cosponsor and the republican lead of mr. engel's legislation. i thank mr. engel. it is fitting that we bring this bill to the floor today, mr. speaker, during national caribbean american heritage month. as a member from south florida, i see firsthand the wonderful contributions that caribbean americans have made to our local communities. the caribbean culture has had a great and lasting impact on our country and has helped bolster our society and has enriched our traditions. but while we celebrate the contributions of the caribbean american community to our country, we must also dedicate ourselves to doing more to enhance our relations with our neighbors. u.s. foreign policy in recent administrations--be they republican or democratic--have not strengthened our partnerships with the caribbean in the right way. as the gentleman from california (mr. royce), our chairman, pointed out, our influence and friendship with these nations has waned, allowing the negative influence of the dictatorships in cuba and venezuela to take root in the caribbean. deepening our strategic relationship with the caribbean represents an extraordinary opportunity to expand our economic ties, to cooperate on security issues, and to advance our values, our interests at institutions such as the oas, the organization of american states, and the u.n., the united nations. that is why, mr. speaker, this bill is so important. it pushes the state department to prioritize our relations [[page h3726]] with the caribbean nations. it requires our state department to develop a strategy to partner with our friends in the region on all issues, from counternarcotics efforts, to energy security, to everything. there is great potential for energy in the caribbean, for example, but we must help nations break from their dependency on venezuelan energy, especially as the maduro regime is leading that nation to total chaos. we should help our neighbors take advantage of abundant and cheap natural gas and new, advanced, clean wind and solar technologies. in this way, we can help strengthen the economies of the region from the impact of the venezuelan collapse--because the collapse is coming, mr. speaker--and take realistic steps toward reducing carbon emissions. this engagement has the benefit of being positive and sound foreign policy, but it is also great for our domestic policy. this bill will broaden our outreach to the caribbean diaspora community here in the united states, which has been so instrumental in helping to shape and influence our great american story, and they deserve recognition and greater collaboration. i urge my colleagues to give their strong support for this bill. i thank ranking member engel for his leadership, as well as chairman royce, on this important initiative. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this bill, which i was proud to introduce, and i yield myself such time as i may consume. i want to thank our chairman, ed royce, for bringing forward my legislation to ramp up our country's engagement with our caribbean neighbors. i also want to thank our former chair, ileana ros-lehtinen, who joined me in offering this bill and who knows better than anyone the strategic importance of the caribbean region. we spend a great deal of time focusing on challenges and opportunities in faraway places, but it is important that we never lose sight of our interests closer to home. indeed, we should be working to strengthen our ties with countries in the caribbean. that is the aim of this bill, which would prioritize u.s.-caribbean relations for years to come. this bill would require the secretary of state, along with the usaid administrator, to devise a multiyear strategy for caribbean engagement. {time} 1800 we want to see how our diplomatic and development efforts are focused on the caribbean, with particular attention to energy security, the rule of law, efforts to combat drug trafficking, and ways to enhance economic cooperation. we also want to increase our engagement when it comes to regional issues by improving our diplomatic efforts with respect to key votes at the united nations and the organization of american states. in my view, the best way to put together a new strategy toward the caribbean is to tap into the large and vibrant caribbean american community here in the united states. i did that for the 4 years that i was chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee of the foreign affairs committee. so this bill underscores the importance of consulting with the caribbean diaspora community, promoting their involvement in economic development, and civilian security in the caribbean. finally, h.r. 4939 commissions two reports from the government accountability office, or gao--one which evaluates the caribbean basin security initiative and another which assesses u.s. diplomatic engagement in the eastern caribbean. i have long believed that we do a real disservice to our country by having no physical diplomatic presence in five of the countries in the eastern caribbean: antigua and barbuda, dominica, st. kitts and nevis, st. lucia, and st. vincent and the grenadines. i have long said it makes no sense for us to continue to conduct diplomacy on these islands from our embassy in barbados. they say you can't conduct diplomacy from a bunker. it is also true that you cannot conduct diplomacy from hundreds of miles away. i hope to work with the state department to ensure that we establish a diplomatic presence in the eastern caribbean as soon as possible. china has it. venezuela has it. others have it. we should have it. it is especially appropriate that we are considering this bill in june, which is national caribbean american heritage month. as the president said in his proclamation: ``the bonds between the united states and the caribbean remain strong. both rooted in similar legacies--of trial and triumph, oppression and liberation--our narratives have advanced on a similar path of progress, driven forward by our shared dedication to fostering opportunity and forging a brighter future.'' i couldn't agree more. i urge my colleagues to support this measure. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california (ms. lee), a leader on the caribbean and author of a resolution honoring caribbean american heritage month. ms. lee. mr. speaker, first, let me take a moment to offer my condolences and prayers to the families and victims of the horrific gun violence against the lgbt community in orlando. these despicable acts have shattered the lives of so many people. our response must be not only in words, but also in deeds and in action. my congressional district has and will continue its outpouring of sympathy and support for the people of orlando, and we stand ready to assist in whatever way is needed. let me now take a moment to thank chairman royce and congresswoman ileana ros-lehtinen. i also thank congressman engel for yielding and for his tremendous leadership on the foreign affairs committee. i had the honor to serve on the western hemisphere subcommittee of the foreign affairs committee for several years when mr. engel was chair. we talked early on about the importance of the caribbean as a region and how we must make it a priority in our foreign policy. so today i want to thank both sides: our ranking member, chairman royce, congresswoman ileana ros-lehtinen, and especially mr. engel, for not just their words, but also their tremendous leadership, as demonstrated by this important bill. it has taken a while to get to this point, but thank goodness we are doing this in a bipartisan way. so i just want to thank them very much for that. as a lead cosponsor, of course, i stand in strong support of h.r. 4939. the bill would enhance u.s.-caribbean relationships by requiring the secretary of state, in coordination with the administrator of usaid, to submit a multiyear strategy for u.s. engagement with our caribbean neighbors to congress. i just want to, again, thank both sides. i remember when we had to work to really get the caribbean to be included in all pepfar legislation, programs, and funding. so that was a major step in the right direction. this is a huge step now in moving forward. this bill is very timely. it is a very important bill. as a long-time supporter of the caribbean and a frequent visitor to the region--actually, my son attended school in grenada. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. ms. lee. as i said, my son attended school in grenada, and i am a frequent visitor to the region. so i am very proud to see us debate this today and, hopefully, pass the bill again on june 13. congress unanimously passed h. con. res. 71, which mr. engel and ms. ileana ros-lehtinen referenced. i authored that, actually, in february 2006, when president bush was in office. he signed it. since then, president obama has issued a proclamation annually recognizing june as caribbean american heritage month. caribbean americans have contributed immensely to the fabric of the united states. so as we celebrate this month, we are reminded also of the relationship between the united states and our caribbean neighbors. this bill does that and more. [[page h3727]] h.r. 4939 strengthens and enhances ties between the u.s. and the caribbean by promoting energy sustainability, diplomatic relations, and economic cooperation. caribbean countries, unfortunately, have been neglected in our foreign policy. this bill brings a focus on making the caribbean region and the west indies a priority. so, mr. speaker, now is the time for the united states to recommit our strong priorities with our caribbean neighbors. we must revitalize and enhance our outreach to our caribbean neighbors now and in the future. this bill does just that. i urge an ``aye'' vote. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from rhode island (mr. cicilline), a very valued member of the foreign affairs committee. mr. cicilline. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, before i begin my remarks, i, too, extend my prayers and sympathy to the people of orlando. my constituents, like all americans, are brokenhearted at this monstrous act of violence visited upon a community gathered together to enjoy friendship and community and to celebrate. this act of cowardice has caused so much pain to the lgbt community in orlando and to our community all across this country. i know i speak for everyone when i say we stand ready to do everything that we can to help this community heal and to keep our communities safe. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 4939, the united states-caribbean strategic engagement act of 2016. my home state of rhode island is home to many caribbean americans, particularly from the dominican republic, haiti, and other countries in the region. it is critical to strengthen our relationship with these countries not just because of the national security interests we share, but also to support the interests of our constituents and their ties to this region. geographic proximity has ensured strong linkages between the united states and the caribbean region. h.r. 4939 will further enhance this relationship. our interests in the regions are diverse, including economic, political, and security concerns. despite its importance to the united states, the caribbean often gets overlooked as we deal with concerns and threats from other regions of the world. our caribbean neighbors are important partners at the united nations and the organization of american states. increasing engagements with the governments and the caribbean diaspora in the united states, as well as the private sector and civil society in both the united states and the caribbean, will be beneficial to everyone. h.r. 4939 will enhance diplomatic relations, increase economic cooperation, support security integration efforts to help reduce violence and drug trafficking, advance cooperation on democracy and human rights in the region and at multilateral fora, and enhance cooperation in combating public health threats. i want to end by thanking ranking member engel, chairman royce, and subcommittee chair ileana ros-lehtinen, and all the sponsors of this important bill, and i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, in april of 2009, i had the honor of joining president obama in trinidad and tobago for the summit of the americas. that was one of his first trips abroad as president. i was chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee at the time. at that time, the president said: ``the energy, the dynamism, the diversity of the caribbean people inspires us all, and are such an important part of what we share in common as a hemisphere.'' seven years later, those words continue to ring true. in that time, we have made a lot of progress. the caribbean basin security initiative and the caribbean energy security initiative have brought us closer to our caribbean partners on a range of shared concerns. let me say that vice president biden deserves a great deal of credit for this progress, but more needs to be done. for example, this week, secretary kerry is in the dominican republic for the general assembly meeting of the oas, the organization of american states, which has its headquarters right here in washington, d.c. we are confronting some serious issues at this meeting, including the crisis in venezuela. the caribbean countries represented there will play a major role, and the more we work in partnership with these governments, the better. these may be small countries, but they pack a big punch in what is going on in our neighborhood. this legislation will keep us moving in the right direction when it comes to these partnerships. i was very honored to introduce the bill, and i am honored that we have strong support on both sides of the aisle. i, again, want to thank chairman royce and chairwoman emeritus ileana ros-lehtinen, both excellent members and real, stalwart support for this committee. this is another example of bipartisanship on the house foreign affairs committee. i am very, very proud of that. so this will keep us moving in the right direction. i urge a ``yes'' vote. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, i thank, once again, ranking member engel for his tremendous leadership and all of his efforts to promote stronger relationships with nations within our own hemisphere. i have the distinct pleasure, as i have said, to represent south florida in congress. we have many, many constituents in my district from the caribbean. part of what makes south florida so unique is the contribution of the caribbean diaspora. what we have here during caribbean american heritage month is an opportunity to strengthen the u.s.-caribbean alliance and contribute in a meaningful and positive way to our neighbors. we have been in a crisis mode, mr. speaker, focusing most of our attention on the many areas that, rightfully, demand our attention overseas, but it would be in both of our long-term interests, as well as our near-term interests, to develop mutually beneficial and strategic alliances close to home with the caribbean nations. just think of all the economic opportunities that we can help in working with our neighbors to open up. we have a great opportunity with this bill to help them diversify their economies by tearing down burdensome barriers that are preventing them from taking advantage of direct foreign investment and trade. that can lead to greater growth, more stability for the caribbean, for the diaspora, and for the united states as a whole. so i urge my colleagues to support passage of this important bill. i look forward to continuing to work with mr. engel and mr. royce to develop even stronger ties to our neighbors in the hemisphere. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 4939, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be

(E) Current awardees.--The Foundation shall work with awardees for whom awards with contingency provisions have been made before the date of enactment of this Act-- (i) to determine if any of their use of contingency funds represents out-of-scope changes for which Foundation's prior written approval was not obtained; and (ii) if out-of-scope changes are found, to identify any financial action that may be appropriate. (5) Management fees.-- (A) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term ``management fee'' means a portion of an award made by the Foundation for the purpose of covering ordinary and legitimate business expenses necessary to maintain [[Page H3733]] operational stability which are not otherwise allowable under Cost Principles Uniform Guidance in 2 C.F.R. part 200, Subpart E, or any successor regulation thereto.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5049, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to sponsor H.R. 5049, the NSF Major Research Facility Reform Act of 2016, to improve the management and oversight of major multi-user research facilities that are funded by the National Science Foundation and to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent with transparency and accountability. The NSF funds a variety of large research projects through cooperative agreements, including multi-user research facilities, tools for research and education, and instrumentation networks. Current construction projects underway include the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Daniel Inouye Solar Telescope, and the National Ecological Observatory Network, otherwise known as NEON. These 5- to 10-year construction projects range from $350 million to $500 million in total project cost. The proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars is paramount when executing projects of this magnitude. The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held a number of hearings over the last year and a half on these large research projects, including several on the NEON Project, after learning about the mismanagement of appropriated funds. Specifically, the hearings discussed the findings of two financial audits. One of those audits discovered that NEON was allowed to use Federal taxpayer dollars for explicitly unallowable costs, including liquor, lobbying, and a lavish holiday party. Both audits of the NEON Project were initiated by the NSF inspector general due to concerns about the lack of review of costs by the NSF. In addition, the IG had concerns about the NSF's accounting financial controls of major research facilities prior to entering into cooperative agreements. The IG's work, combined with the oversight of this committee's, resulted in the National Academy of Public Administration's, also known as NAPA, conducting a commissioned review of the NSF's management of cooperative agreements. The bill I bring to the floor today is a product of many recommendations that were made by the NSF IG, the auditors, NAPA, and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. First, the bill enhances the role of the NSF Large Facilities Office in project management, giving it statutory permanence and ensuring that expert management staff at the NSF work with scientific program staff throughout all phases of project development and construction. It also requires a senior agency official to have responsibility for the oversight of the office. Second, the bill requires the NSF to commission an external cost proposal analysis for all major multi-user research facilities with a total project cost of over $100 million. This will ensure that proposed construction budgets are reasonable while allowing the NSF and the awardee to address all cost issues before construction begins. This small investment at the beginning of the award will pay off in savings for the life of the construction project. Third, the bill requires an incurred cost audit at least every 2 years during construction, starting 1 year after the execution of the agreement. These regular audits will help ensure that a project is on track and will detect problems while something can still be done to remedy the problem, not after the project is well on its way to being over budget or is already complete. Fourth, the bill increases agency control over project contingency funds by requiring the NSF to retain the majority of the funds rather than the awardee. Reflecting the input of many stakeholders, the bill allows the NSF to disburse contingency funds incrementally to the awardee to allow for project continuity and stability. Contingency expenditures must be supported by verifiable cost data, and the awardee must record and report all contingency expenditures to the NSF. Next, the bill closes loopholes for the use of management fees, codifying regulations that the NSF has recently put into place to ensure taxpayer funds are never abused again. This prohibition includes alcohol, concert tickets, unnecessary travel, and lobbying. The bill also requires awardees to demonstrate a financial need to justify management fees which are included as part of the award. Finally, the bill has a provision that supports the education of the NSF grant awardees and their employees on the law that protects whistleblowers. It was thanks to a whistleblower auditor that many of the issues with the NEON Project were brought to light. As a former small business owner and as the former director of a nonprofit, I, wholeheartedly, understand the importance of accountability. The fact that the NSF is mishandling American taxpayer dollars, with little consequence, [[Page H3734]] is inexcusable. What is even more inexcusable is that the NSF has received warnings about this kind of irresponsible spending over the past 4 years, and it has not taken adequate measures to resolve the matter. This bill will ensure that the NSF makes the systematic changes necessary to restore confidence in federally funded research projects and that taxpayers can trust us with their money in their knowing that it will be spent in the manner it was intended. I thank Chairman Smith for his support in moving this bill forward, and I ask my colleagues to join me in passing these commonsense reforms. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 5049, the NSF Major Research Facility Reform Act of 2016. While I support the passage of this bill in the House today, I do so with some reservations, which I will discuss later in my remarks. Major research facilities play a central role in helping the NSF meet its mission to promote the progress of science and cultivate the next generation of scientists and innovators. These facilities include telescopes, research ships, engineering test beds, and other cutting- edge research platforms. We recently held a hearing to congratulate the scientists who are working on one such endeavor, the LIGO project, which detected gravity waves. As the LIGO project demonstrated, these efforts involving major facilities have the potential to generate profound breakthroughs in science and to inspire a whole new generation of our best and brightest to pursue careers in STEM. However, these major facilities also cost a lot of money. Properly managing those large expenses is critical to ensuring the success of the major facilities projects and is, ultimately, critical to the advancement of science. The intent of this bill is a good one. It is to ensure the proper oversight and accountability for the National Science Foundation's investments in major research facilities. The National Science Foundation manages about 15 research facilities across its diverse science and engineering portfolio. In any given year, three or four new major facilities are under construction. H.R. 5049 largely addresses the design and construction phase of these facilities, which is the highest-risk phase. Republican and Democratic members and staff of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology worked together over many weeks to develop and move through the committee a bill that addresses the need for strong oversight and accountability while taking into consideration the legitimate concerns of the agency and stakeholder groups about unintended consequences. I appreciate the work of Mr. Loudermilk and Chairman Smith and the Republican and Democratic staffs in this regard. However, the devil is always in the details, and I hope that discussion will continue on some of the details if this legislation continues to move forward. The fact is that every other Federal agency is held to governmentwide standards and policies for contracting. In this bill, we are creating a different set of rules with less flexibility for the National Science Foundation even though the Foundation's record, overall, has been a very good one and even though the Foundation has taken many aggressive steps already to rectify deficiencies where they did exist. As such, I hope that we tread carefully. Given that the impetus for this bill was one project that went awry because of an inexperienced project management team, the last thing we want to do is to enact a law that discourages the most experienced project management professionals from doing business with the NSF, thereby increasing the risk to the taxpayer. {time} 1915 In closing, I want to thank Mr. Loudermilk and Chairman Smith for working with us to improve the legislation; and I hope we continue to work with the agency, the National Science Board, and the expert stakeholders to ensure we achieve our shared goals of both safeguarding taxpayers' money and promoting the progress of science I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader. Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the Innovation Initiative is about two things: enabling innovation in the private sector, and bringing innovation into government. It has now been 3 months since we started the Innovation Initiative. In that time, we have met with innovators at the forefront of both our missions. Today in the House, we are focused on harnessing innovation for the public good. Just moments ago, we passed Representative Darin LaHood's bill to advance networking and information technology research and development; and now we are considering Barry Loudermilk's reform of the National Science Foundation. Basic research and development investment is important as we strive to remain at the cutting edge of technologies that will offer Americans a happier and healthier life. But when the integrity of such efforts at public institutions is compromised, as happened with the major NSF facility that experienced massive cost overruns last year, it calls into question the entire model. So this bill makes changes to our research facilities to make them operate with transparency and accountability. When you look across our government, you can see inefficiencies, a lack of accountability, and practices and policies that just don't make sense. That is bad for the workers, it is bad for business, and, most importantly, it is bad for America. Here in the House, we aren't accepting the status quo. If it doesn't make sense, we are getting rid of it. If it is holding back innovation, we are changing it. Mr. Speaker, we will surely consider more pieces of innovation initiative in the weeks and months to come. Unleashing the power of innovation, we will ensure American leadership now and into the future. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Loudermilk is the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee's Oversight Subcommittee, and I appreciate all the work he has done on this bill. H.R. 5049, the NSF Major Research Facility Reform Act, is the second bill today that is part of Majority Leader McCarthy's Innovation Initiative. We appreciate all of his efforts on this and other innovation bills, which now total 17. This legislation addresses an issue about which the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has expressed concerns for the last 2 years: the National Science Foundation past management of major research facility projects. The Science, Space, and Technology Committee seeks to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent on research in the national interest, not wasted on mismanagement and questionable costs. This bill achieves that goal. It addresses gaps in project oversight and management through solutions identified by the NSF inspector general, auditors, an outside review panel, and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee's own oversight for a year and a half. Last year, in the wake of several reports of project waste and mismanagement, NSF Director France A. Cordova agreed to commission a study by the National Academy of Public Administration to take a closer look at how NSF could better manage large-scale research projects. The study's report offered 13 recommendations to improve NSF's management of cooperative agreements. Although NSF has begun to implement some of the recommendations, there is still a need to implement four key measures addressed in this bill: preconstruction verification of total project cost, incurred cost audits during construction, better control over contingency funds, and proper use of taxpayer-funded management fees. [[Page H3735]] The bill's approach to these four reforms ensures that no current or future large-scale research project faces the same financial mismanagement that plagued one of NSF's largest projects, the $400 million National Ecological Observatory Network, called NEON. Last September, we learned that the project was likely to be $80 million overbudget and 18 months behind schedule. I recognize that the NSF is taking steps to better manage the cost of NEON, which include firing the management organization; however, it is time to make systemic changes for all current and future major research projects. The accountability provisions in the bill have been developed with input from the minority, the NSF, and many stakeholders. We incorporated many of their suggestions during the markup of the bill in committee on April 27, and the bill was reported out of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee by voice vote. Our staff has continued to work with the minority on the report that was filed with the bill to make sure our intentions in the underlying bill are clear. Although I believe the current NSF leadership is committed to improving its management of these construction projects, we need to make sure that the NSF will make the systemic changes necessary in a timely and permanent fashion. This change of how the NSF does business should outlast the current administration. Many stakeholders have expressed support for the bill since it provides certainty for how the NSF will operate. All agencies as well as their grantees and contractors need to be held accountable for how they spend taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. The basic responsibility of any government agency is to act in the national interest. H.R. 5049 will reduce waste, fraud, and abuse and make more resources available for quality basic research. This will lead to scientific discoveries, spur technological innovation, create new industries, and provide better jobs for Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this good government accountability bill. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to know that this is a part of the innovation project. There are a number of good bills in the committee that we could really make a part of that package. I have no further speakers, and I urge support of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this strong bipartisan measure. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MacArthur). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5049, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3732-H3735] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NSF MAJOR RESEARCH FACILITY REFORM ACT OF 2016 Mr. LOUDERMILK.

Mr. Speaker, the Innovation Initiative is about two things: enabling innovation in the private sector, and bringing innovation into government. It has now been 3 months since we started the Innovation Initiative. In that time, we have met with innovators at the forefront of both our missions. Today in the House, we are focused on harnessing innovation for the public good. Just moments ago, we passed Representative Darin LaHood's bill to advance networking and information technology research and development; and now we are considering Barry Loudermilk's reform of the National Science Foundation. Basic research and development investment is important as we strive to remain at the cutting edge of technologies that will offer Americans a happier and healthier life. But when the integrity of such efforts at public institutions is compromised, as happened with the major NSF facility that experienced massive cost overruns last year, it calls into question the entire model. So this bill makes changes to our research facilities to make them operate with transparency and accountability. When you look across our government, you can see inefficiencies, a lack of accountability, and practices and policies that just don't make sense. That is bad for the workers, it is bad for business, and, most importantly, it is bad for America. Here in the House, we aren't accepting the status quo. If it doesn't make sense, we are getting rid of it. If it is holding back innovation, we are changing it. Mr. Speaker, we will surely consider more pieces of innovation initiative in the weeks and months to come. Unleashing the power of innovation, we will ensure American leadership now and into the future. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Loudermilk is the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee's Oversight Subcommittee, and I appreciate all the work he has done on this bill. H.R. 5049, the NSF Major Research Facility Reform Act, is the second bill today that is part of Majority Leader McCarthy's Innovation Initiative. We appreciate all of his efforts on this and other innovation bills, which now total 17. This legislation addresses an issue about which the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has expressed concerns for the last 2 years: the National Science Foundation past management of major research facility projects. The Science, Space, and Technology Committee seeks to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent on research in the national interest, not wasted on mismanagement and questionable costs. This bill achieves that goal. It addresses gaps in project oversight and management through solutions identified by the NSF inspector general, auditors, an outside review panel, and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee's own oversight for a year and a half. Last year, in the wake of several reports of project waste and mismanagement, NSF Director France A. Cordova agreed to commission a study by the National Academy of Public Administration to take a closer look at how NSF could better manage large-scale research projects. The study's report offered 13 recommendations to improve NSF's management of cooperative agreements. Although NSF has begun to implement some of the recommendations, there is still a need to implement four key measures addressed in this bill: preconstruction verification of total project cost, incurred cost audits during construction, better control over contingency funds, and proper use of taxpayer-funded management fees. [[Page H3735]] The bill's approach to these four reforms ensures that no current or future large-scale research project faces the same financial mismanagement that plagued one of NSF's largest projects, the $400 million National Ecological Observatory Network, called NEON. Last September, we learned that the project was likely to be $80 million overbudget and 18 months behind schedule. I recognize that the NSF is taking steps to better manage the cost of NEON, which include firing the management organization; however, it is time to make systemic changes for all current and future major research projects. The accountability provisions in the bill have been developed with input from the minority, the NSF, and many stakeholders. We incorporated many of their suggestions during the markup of the bill in committee on April 27, and the bill was reported out of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee by voice vote. Our staff has continued to work with the minority on the report that was filed with the bill to make sure our intentions in the underlying bill are clear. Although I believe the current NSF leadership is committed to improving its management of these construction projects, we need to make sure that the NSF will make the systemic changes necessary in a timely and permanent fashion. This change of how the NSF does business should outlast the current administration. Many stakeholders have expressed support for the bill since it provides certainty for how the NSF will operate. All agencies as well as their grantees and contractors need to be held accountable for how they spend taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. The basic responsibility of any government agency is to act in the national interest. H.R. 5049 will reduce waste, fraud, and abuse and make more resources available for quality basic research. This will lead to scientific discoveries, spur technological innovation, create new industries, and provide better jobs for Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this good government accountability bill. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to know that this is a part of the innovation project. There are a number of good bills in the committee that we could really make a part of that package. I have no further speakers, and I urge support of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this strong bipartisan measure. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MacArthur). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5049, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3732-H3735] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NSF MAJOR RESEARCH FACILITY REFORM ACT OF 2016 Mr. LOUDERMILK.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5049, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to sponsor H.R. 5049, the NSF Major Research Facility Reform Act of 2016, to improve the management and oversight of major multi-user research facilities that are funded by the National Science Foundation and to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent with transparency and accountability. The NSF funds a variety of large research projects through cooperative agreements, including multi-user research facilities, tools for research and education, and instrumentation networks. Current construction projects underway include the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Daniel Inouye Solar Telescope, and the National Ecological Observatory Network, otherwise known as NEON. These 5- to 10-year construction projects range from $350 million to $500 million in total project cost. The proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars is paramount when executing projects of this magnitude. The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held a number of hearings over the last year and a half on these large research projects, including several on the NEON Project, after learning about the mismanagement of appropriated funds. Specifically, the hearings discussed the findings of two financial audits. One of those audits discovered that NEON was allowed to use Federal taxpayer dollars for explicitly unallowable costs, including liquor, lobbying, and a lavish holiday party. Both audits of the NEON Project were initiated by the NSF inspector general due to concerns about the lack of review of costs by the NSF. In addition, the IG had concerns about the NSF's accounting financial controls of major research facilities prior to entering into cooperative agreements. The IG's work, combined with the oversight of this committee's, resulted in the National Academy of Public Administration's, also known as NAPA, conducting a commissioned review of the NSF's management of cooperative agreements. The bill I bring to the floor today is a product of many recommendations that were made by the NSF IG, the auditors, NAPA, and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. First, the bill enhances the role of the NSF Large Facilities Office in project management, giving it statutory permanence and ensuring that expert management staff at the NSF work with scientific program staff throughout all phases of project development and construction. It also requires a senior agency official to have responsibility for the oversight of the office. Second, the bill requires the NSF to commission an external cost proposal analysis for all major multi-user research facilities with a total project cost of over $100 million. This will ensure that proposed construction budgets are reasonable while allowing the NSF and the awardee to address all cost issues before construction begins. This small investment at the beginning of the award will pay off in savings for the life of the construction project. Third, the bill requires an incurred cost audit at least every 2 years during construction, starting 1 year after the execution of the agreement. These regular audits will help ensure that a project is on track and will detect problems while something can still be done to remedy the problem, not after the project is well on its way to being over budget or is already complete. Fourth, the bill increases agency control over project contingency funds by requiring the NSF to retain the majority of the funds rather than the awardee. Reflecting the input of many stakeholders, the bill allows the NSF to disburse contingency funds incrementally to the awardee to allow for project continuity and stability. Contingency expenditures must be supported by verifiable cost data, and the awardee must record and report all contingency expenditures to the NSF. Next, the bill closes loopholes for the use of management fees, codifying regulations that the NSF has recently put into place to ensure taxpayer funds are never abused again. This prohibition includes alcohol, concert tickets, unnecessary travel, and lobbying. The bill also requires awardees to demonstrate a financial need to justify management fees which are included as part of the award. Finally, the bill has a provision that supports the education of the NSF grant awardees and their employees on the law that protects whistleblowers. It was thanks to a whistleblower auditor that many of the issues with the NEON Project were brought to light. As a former small business owner and as the former director of a nonprofit, I, wholeheartedly, understand the importance of accountability. The fact that the NSF is mishandling American taxpayer dollars, with little consequence, [[Page H3734]] is inexcusable. What is even more inexcusable is that the NSF has received warnings about this kind of irresponsible spending over the past 4 years, and it has not taken adequate measures to resolve the matter. This bill will ensure that the NSF makes the systematic changes necessary to restore confidence in federally funded research projects and that taxpayers can trust us with their money in their knowing that it will be spent in the manner it was intended. I thank Chairman Smith for his support in moving this bill forward, and I ask my colleagues to join me in passing these commonsense reforms. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 5049, the NSF Major Research Facility Reform Act of 2016. While I support the passage of this bill in the House today, I do so with some reservations, which I will discuss later in my remarks. Major research facilities play a central role in helping the NSF meet its mission to promote the progress of science and cultivate the next generation of scientists and innovators. These facilities include telescopes, research ships, engineering test beds, and other cutting- edge research platforms. We recently held a hearing to congratulate the scientists who are working on one such endeavor, the LIGO project, which detected gravity waves. As the LIGO project demonstrated, these efforts involving major facilities have the potential to generate profound breakthroughs in science and to inspire a whole new generation of our best and brightest to pursue careers in STEM. However, these major facilities also cost a lot of money. Properly managing those large expenses is critical to ensuring the success of the major facilities projects and is, ultimately, critical to the advancement of science. The intent of this bill is a good one. It is to ensure the proper oversight and accountability for the National Science Foundation's investments in major research facilities. The National Science Foundation manages about 15 research facilities across its diverse science and engineering portfolio. In any given year, three or four new major facilities are under construction. H.R. 5049 largely addresses the design and construction phase of these facilities, which is the highest-risk phase. Republican and Democratic members and staff of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology worked together over many weeks to develop and move through the committee a bill that addresses the need for strong oversight and accountability while taking into consideration the legitimate concerns of the agency and stakeholder groups about unintended consequences. I appreciate the work of Mr. Loudermilk and Chairman Smith and the Republican and Democratic staffs in this regard. However, the devil is always in the details, and I hope that discussion will continue on some of the details if this legislation continues to move forward. The fact is that every other Federal agency is held to governmentwide standards and policies for contracting. In this bill, we are creating a different set of rules with less flexibility for the National Science Foundation even though the Foundation's record, overall, has been a very good one and even though the Foundation has taken many aggressive steps already to rectify deficiencies where they did exist. As such, I hope that we tread carefully. Given that the impetus for this bill was one project that went awry because of an inexperienced project management team, the last thing we want to do is to enact a law that discourages the most experienced project management professionals from doing business with the NSF, thereby increasing the risk to the taxpayer. {time} 1915 In closing, I want to thank Mr. Loudermilk and Chairman Smith for working with us to improve the legislation; and I hope we continue to work with the agency, the National Science Board, and the expert stakeholders to ensure we achieve our shared goals of both safeguarding taxpayers' money and promoting the progress of science I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader. Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the Innovation Initiative is about two things: enabling innovation in the private sector, and bringing innovation into government.

(ms. eddie bernice johnson) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from georgia. general leave mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on h.r. 5049, the bill now under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from georgia? there was no objection. mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i am pleased to sponsor h.r. 5049, the nsf major research facility reform act of 2016, to improve the management and oversight of major multi-user research facilities that are funded by the national science foundation and to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent with transparency and accountability. the nsf funds a variety of large research projects through cooperative agreements, including multi-user research facilities, tools for research and education, and instrumentation networks. current construction projects underway include the large synoptic survey telescope, the daniel inouye solar telescope, and the national ecological observatory network, otherwise known as neon. these 5- to 10-year construction projects range from $350 million to $500 million in total project cost. the proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars is paramount when executing projects of this magnitude. the committee on science, space, and technology held a number of hearings over the last year and a half on these large research projects, including several on the neon project, after learning about the mismanagement of appropriated funds. specifically, the hearings discussed the findings of two financial audits. one of those audits discovered that neon was allowed to use federal taxpayer dollars for explicitly unallowable costs, including liquor, lobbying, and a lavish holiday party. both audits of the neon project were initiated by the nsf inspector general due to concerns about the lack of review of costs by the nsf. in addition, the ig had concerns about the nsf's accounting financial controls of major research facilities prior to entering into cooperative agreements. the ig's work, combined with the oversight of this committee's, resulted in the national academy of public administration's, also known as napa, conducting a commissioned review of the nsf's management of cooperative agreements. the bill i bring to the floor today is a product of many recommendations that were made by the nsf ig, the auditors, napa, and the committee on science, space, and technology. first, the bill enhances the role of the nsf large facilities office in project management, giving it statutory permanence and ensuring that expert management staff at the nsf work with scientific program staff throughout all phases of project development and construction. it also requires a senior agency official to have responsibility for the oversight of the office. second, the bill requires the nsf to commission an external cost proposal analysis for all major multi-user research facilities with a total project cost of over $100 million. this will ensure that proposed construction budgets are reasonable while allowing the nsf and the awardee to address all cost issues before construction begins. this small investment at the beginning of the award will pay off in savings for the life of the construction project. third, the bill requires an incurred cost audit at least every 2 years during construction, starting 1 year after the execution of the agreement. these regular audits will help ensure that a project is on track and will detect problems while something can still be done to remedy the problem, not after the project is well on its way to being over budget or is already complete. fourth, the bill increases agency control over project contingency funds by requiring the nsf to retain the majority of the funds rather than the awardee. reflecting the input of many stakeholders, the bill allows the nsf to disburse contingency funds incrementally to the awardee to allow for project continuity and stability. contingency expenditures must be supported by verifiable cost data, and the awardee must record and report all contingency expenditures to the nsf. next, the bill closes loopholes for the use of management fees, codifying regulations that the nsf has recently put into place to ensure taxpayer funds are never abused again. this prohibition includes alcohol, concert tickets, unnecessary travel, and lobbying. the bill also requires awardees to demonstrate a financial need to justify management fees which are included as part of the award. finally, the bill has a provision that supports the education of the nsf grant awardees and their employees on the law that protects whistleblowers. it was thanks to a whistleblower auditor that many of the issues with the neon project were brought to light. as a former small business owner and as the former director of a nonprofit, i, wholeheartedly, understand the importance of accountability. the fact that the nsf is mishandling american taxpayer dollars, with little consequence, [[page h3734]] is inexcusable. what is even more inexcusable is that the nsf has received warnings about this kind of irresponsible spending over the past 4 years, and it has not taken adequate measures to resolve the matter. this bill will ensure that the nsf makes the systematic changes necessary to restore confidence in federally funded research projects and that taxpayers can trust us with their money in their knowing that it will be spent in the manner it was intended. i thank chairman smith for his support in moving this bill forward, and i ask my colleagues to join me in passing these commonsense reforms. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h.r. 5049, the nsf major research facility reform act of 2016. while i support the passage of this bill in the house today, i do so with some reservations, which i will discuss later in my remarks. major research facilities play a central role in helping the nsf meet its mission to promote the progress of science and cultivate the next generation of scientists and innovators. these facilities include telescopes, research ships, engineering test beds, and other cutting- edge research platforms. we recently held a hearing to congratulate the scientists who are working on one such endeavor, the ligo project, which detected gravity waves. as the ligo project demonstrated, these efforts involving major facilities have the potential to generate profound breakthroughs in science and to inspire a whole new generation of our best and brightest to pursue careers in stem. however, these major facilities also cost a lot of money. properly managing those large expenses is critical to ensuring the success of the major facilities projects and is, ultimately, critical to the advancement of science. the intent of this bill is a good one. it is to ensure the proper oversight and accountability for the national science foundation's investments in major research facilities. the national science foundation manages about 15 research facilities across its diverse science and engineering portfolio. in any given year, three or four new major facilities are under construction. h.r. 5049 largely addresses the design and construction phase of these facilities, which is the highest-risk phase. republican and democratic members and staff of the committee on science, space, and technology worked together over many weeks to develop and move through the committee a bill that addresses the need for strong oversight and accountability while taking into consideration the legitimate concerns of the agency and stakeholder groups about unintended consequences. i appreciate the work of mr. loudermilk and chairman smith and the republican and democratic staffs in this regard. however, the devil is always in the details, and i hope that discussion will continue on some of the details if this legislation continues to move forward. the fact is that every other federal agency is held to governmentwide standards and policies for contracting. in this bill, we are creating a different set of rules with less flexibility for the national science foundation even though the foundation's record, overall, has been a very good one and even though the foundation has taken many aggressive steps already to rectify deficiencies where they did exist. as such, i hope that we tread carefully. given that the impetus for this bill was one project that went awry because of an inexperienced project management team, the last thing we want to do is to enact a law that discourages the most experienced project management professionals from doing business with the nsf, thereby increasing the risk to the taxpayer. {time} 1915 in closing, i want to thank mr. loudermilk and chairman smith for working with us to improve the legislation; and i hope we continue to work with the agency, the national science board, and the expert stakeholders to ensure we achieve our shared goals of both safeguarding taxpayers' money and promoting the progress of science i reserve the balance of my time. mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. mccarthy), the majority leader. mr. mccarthy. mr. speaker, the innovation initiative is about two things: enabling innovation in the private sector, and bringing innovation into government. it has now been 3 months since we started the innovation initiative. in that time, we have met with innovators at the forefront of both our missions. today in the house, we are focused on harnessing innovation for the public good. just moments ago, we passed representative darin lahood's bill to advance networking and information technology research and development; and now we are considering barry loudermilk's reform of the national science foundation. basic research and development investment is important as we strive to remain at the cutting edge of technologies that will offer americans a happier and healthier life. but when the integrity of such efforts at public institutions is compromised, as happened with the major nsf facility that experienced massive cost overruns last year, it calls into question the entire model. so this bill makes changes to our research facilities to make them operate with transparency and accountability. when you look across our government, you can see inefficiencies, a lack of accountability, and practices and policies that just don't make sense. that is bad for the workers, it is bad for business, and, most importantly, it is bad for america. here in the house, we aren't accepting the status quo. if it doesn't make sense, we are getting rid of it. if it is holding back innovation, we are changing it. mr. speaker, we will surely consider more pieces of innovation initiative in the weeks and months to come. unleashing the power of innovation, we will ensure american leadership now and into the future. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. smith), the chairman of the science, space, and technology committee. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, mr. loudermilk is the chairman of the science, space, and technology committee's oversight subcommittee, and i appreciate all the work he has done on this bill. h.r. 5049, the nsf major research facility reform act, is the second bill today that is part of majority leader mccarthy's innovation initiative. we appreciate all of his efforts on this and other innovation bills, which now total 17. this legislation addresses an issue about which the science, space, and technology committee has expressed concerns for the last 2 years: the national science foundation past management of major research facility projects. the science, space, and technology committee seeks to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent on research in the national interest, not wasted on mismanagement and questionable costs. this bill achieves that goal. it addresses gaps in project oversight and management through solutions identified by the nsf inspector general, auditors, an outside review panel, and the science, space, and technology committee's own oversight for a year and a half. last year, in the wake of several reports of project waste and mismanagement, nsf director france a. cordova agreed to commission a study by the national academy of public administration to take a closer look at how nsf could better manage large-scale research projects. the study's report offered 13 recommendations to improve nsf's management of cooperative agreements. although nsf has begun to implement some of the recommendations, there is still a need to implement four key measures addressed in this bill: preconstruction verification of total project cost, incurred cost audits during construction, better control over contingency funds, and proper use of taxpayer-funded management fees. [[page h3735]] the bill's approach to these four reforms ensures that no current or future large-scale research project faces the same financial mismanagement that plagued one of nsf's largest projects, the $400 million national ecological observatory network, called neon. last september, we learned that the project was likely to be $80 million overbudget and 18 months behind schedule. i recognize that the nsf is taking steps to better manage the cost of neon, which include firing the management organization; however, it is time to make systemic changes for all current and future major research projects. the accountability provisions in the bill have been developed with input from the minority, the nsf, and many stakeholders. we incorporated many of their suggestions during the markup of the bill in committee on april 27, and the bill was reported out of the science, space, and technology committee by voice vote. our staff has continued to work with the minority on the report that was filed with the bill to make sure our intentions in the underlying bill are clear. although i believe the current nsf leadership is committed to improving its management of these construction projects, we need to make sure that the nsf will make the systemic changes necessary in a timely and permanent fashion. this change of how the nsf does business should outlast the current administration. many stakeholders have expressed support for the bill since it provides certainty for how the nsf will operate. all agencies as well as their grantees and contractors need to be held accountable for how they spend taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. the basic responsibility of any government agency is to act in the national interest. h.r. 5049 will reduce waste, fraud, and abuse and make more resources available for quality basic research. this will lead to scientific discoveries, spur technological innovation, create new industries, and provide better jobs for americans. mr. speaker, i urge the adoption of this good government accountability bill. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i am delighted to know that this is a part of the innovation project. there are a number of good bills in the committee that we could really make a part of that package. i have no further speakers, and i urge support of the bill. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this strong bipartisan measure. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore (mr. macarthur). the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from georgia (mr. loudermilk) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 5049, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",26810

Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, as we grapple with the horrific events that took place yesterday morning in Orlando, my thoughts are with the families of the victims and everyone affected during Pride Month. The targeting of LGBT individuals in this heinous act of violence has reignited many fears and uncertainty in our community. As a country, we must stand together to denounce bigotry and hatred and embrace love and acceptance. President Barack Obama declared this an act of terror and an act of hate, an action perpetrated with a military-style assault weapon. Unfortunately, this week Congress won't do a thing about any of these issues. In fact, all too often actions and language here in Congress and on the campaign trail actually exacerbate would-be terrorists, and actions even on the floor of the House of Representatives all too often reinforce the hate of some people, including gays and lesbians. Unfortunately, this body is too chicken to address the epidemic of military-style assault weapons because that would upset the gun manufacturers and gun lobby. In the end, all we did, yet again, is have another moment of silence rather than a moment of action.

A stronger background check system will help prevent hate crimes and acts of terrorism to protect Americans from terrorists who want to attack our way of life. We must give the FBI the authority to block sales to suspected terrorists, and we must require background checks for every gun sale in America. Mr. Speaker, no more silence. Let's stand up as Americans, and in this Congress, and tell the American people, those who are mourning, and those across this country who have experienced this that we in Congress will do the work we were sent here to do, and that is to stand up and take action. ____________________",package_114_183.csv,1289,1289,1355,"[congressional record volume 162, number 93 (monday, june 13, 2016)] [house] [page h3737] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] the deadliest shooting in american history (mrs. lawrence asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) mrs. lawrence. mr. speaker, the june 12 mass shooting at a club in orlando, florida, was not only the deadliest shooting in american history, it was one of the most heinous hate crimes and acts of terrorism this country has ever seen. too often hate crimes and acts of terrorism use guns. the epidemic overwhelmingly express the need to strengthen our gun laws. a stronger background check system will help prevent hate crimes and acts of terrorism to protect americans from terrorists who want to attack our way of life. we must give the fbi the authority to block sales to suspected terrorists, and we must require background checks for every gun sale in america. mr. speaker, no more silence. let's stand up as americans, and in this congress, and tell the american people, those who are mourning, and those across this country who have experienced this that we in congress will do the work we were sent here to do, and that is to stand up and take action. ____________________",1289

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous materials relevant to the subject matter of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening, along with my colleague, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of the Eighth Congressional District of New York, for tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, Bridging the Divide: A Call to Action By the Congressional Black Caucus to Eliminate Racial Health Disparities. Mr. Speaker, tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor to discuss our overarching goal of promoting equality for African Americans across the healthcare spectrum. Mr. Speaker, it is well known that poverty, socioeconomic status, and health disparities are closely linked and latched together. For example, individuals with low incomes tend to have more restricted access to medical care and face greater financial barriers to affordable health care, oftentimes contributing to health disparities. Last week, Mr. Speaker, the House Republicans released their Conference's poverty plan called A Better Way. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, this Republican antipoverty proposal isn't a better way, Mr. Speaker. It isn't even a new way. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, it is the wrong way. It uses the same trickle-down, discredited policies that House Republicans have put forth in the past. The House Republicans' poverty elimination proposal would repeal the Affordable Care Act and undermine affordable, quality health coverage that millions of Americans are now enjoying. It would also cut Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program that we refer to as CHIP, and it would end the Medicare guarantee--programs with proven successes, Mr. Speaker, in reducing health disparities. So this is, in part, why we are here tonight. We know that health coverage is the first step in securing better healthcare outcomes, and Medicaid and CHIP play a vital role in opening the doorway to the needed health care, especially for our children. As we address the most pressing challenges in achieving health equity and equality for African Americans, I want hardworking American families to know that they have voices in Congress that aim to protect their safety, invest in their future, and provide affordable health care for all. With the Affordable Care Act, which every member of the Congressional Black Caucus supported when it passed, we have improved access. We have improved affordability and quality of health care. So tonight, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank President Obama for moving the needle forward in helping American families and African American families across this great country and Nation to have the financial and health security that comes with health care. [[Page H3738]] Mr. Speaker, we cannot repeal the ACA. We must continue to improve and strengthen it, and we will still have more work to do. The Congressional Black Caucus, from its very inception, has long been the voice for bridging the divide on racial healthcare disparities. No, Mr. Speaker; we have been the voice for standing up for American people, and especially individuals who are African American, against all disparities. We will not only come to this floor tonight. We will continue our fight and we will continue to come to this floor. Tonight, you are going to hear a lot of our members weave together our poverty plan. You are going to have members talk about gun violence. You are going to have members talk about all lives matter. If we don't end the gun violence, then we are not going to have a healthy nation. Tonight, I want to applaud my good friend and colleague, Congresswoman Robin Kelly of the Second District of Illinois, chair of our Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust. I want to commend her for her report, the 2015 Kelly Report on Health Disparities in America, the official congressional analysis of the state of African Americans' health in the United States, and her work on the 40 Under 40 Leaders in Health Awards, leaders under 40 who are physicians and medical professionals. And lastly, let me just thank her for her courage and her leadership for recognizing that all lives matter. We cannot come to this House floor and talk about poverty programs and health care and education and about finance if we do not bridge the gap with gun violence. I salute her for no longer standing up until we make a difference. So tonight, we are coming, Mr. Speaker, with a strong call to action for us to keep this wonderful America healthy. You will hear from Congresswoman Kelly momentarily. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. He is a chairman who has been a longtime advocate and voice for not only the Congressional Black Caucus, but for his constituents in his congressional district in North Carolina. Tonight, he speaks for us. Tonight, he speaks for the call of action of us to bridge the gap. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. I thank Congresswoman Beatty for yielding to me this evening. This is such a sad evening for all of us because of the events in Orlando. I thank her so very much for having the strength to come to the floor tonight to manage the important topic that we are all so concerned about. I thank Congresswoman Robin Kelly for her incredible work chairing the CBC Health Braintrust and all the work she does related to health disparities in this country. I thank all of my colleagues for their tireless work. Before I begin my remarks, let me just say that I sat on the floor a moment ago and listened to Congresswoman Corrine Brown. It was an incredible 1-minute speech she gave. I want to share in her sentiments this evening and align myself with the pain that she and her constituents are facing in Orlando. The mass shootings were absolutely horrific and unthinkable, under any definition. They are just unthinkable. My prayers go out to the families in Orlando for their pain and for all that they are having to endure because of these mass shootings. As someone said a few moments ago, a moment of silence is not enough. It is time for this Congress to act. It is time for this body, Mr. Speaker, to have a serious debate about gun violence and to pass legislation that will deprive people the right to own a high-capacity assault weapon and high-caliber bullets and use them to kill innocent people. Now is the time. 136 mass shootings have taken place during the first 164 days of this year. It is a sad statistic that we must address. The United States is 5 percent of the world's population, yet we are 31 percent of the mass shootings in the world. It is time to act. Let me talk about the topic tonight, very briefly. The Congressional Black Caucus has been committed to advancing access to affordable health care for all Americans so that we can eliminate racially based health disparities. That has been our mission for many years. Eliminating health disparities means addressing inequities in environmental, social, and economic conditions in all of our communities. By all measurable statistics, from health outcomes to participation in health professions, African Americans lag so far behind. For example, more than 40 percent of African Americans have high blood pressure--a rate that is one of the highest in the world. African Americans are more likely to develop hypertension at a younger age and are at higher risk of stroke, heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and death from heart disease. Stroke, Mr. Speaker, is the third leading cause of death in the United States. African Americans are 50 percent more likely to experience a stroke than White Americans. That is a fact. According to the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, African American children are twice as likely to have asthma as White children, and Black children are 10 times more likely than White children to die of complications from asthma. African Americans were, on average, 6 years younger than Whites when they suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest incidence among African American men was 175 per 100,000; whereas, the incidence for White males was just 84 per 100,000. Cardiac arrest in African American women was 90 per 100,000, as opposed to 40 per 100,000 for Caucasian women. Another illness which disparately impacts the African American community is that of prostate cancer. In June of last year, I introduced the National Prostate Cancer Plan Act, a bipartisan bill which seeks to establish the National Prostate Cancer Council on Screening, Early Detection and Assessment and Monitoring of Prostate Cancer. Prostate cancer impacts one in seven American men and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the U.S., with nearly 30,000 deaths anticipated just this year. African American men are particularly vulnerable, as they are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 2.5 times more likely to die from the disease than their White counterparts. Just last week, House Republicans released their A Better Way agenda to address poverty, but that proposal, like others they have released, will not lift Americans out of poverty. In some cases, these types of proposals can actually push low-income Americans even deeper into poverty, further limiting their access to health care and exacerbating health disparities. So, Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to continue our efforts to address the health disparities and barriers. That is what the Congressional Black Caucus is advocating the evening. We are going to continue this work until every disparity is removed. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank Congressman Butterfield for making us aware of 136 mass shootings in 164 days of this year. Certainly, that is relevant to tonight's topic, because whether it is death by guns or death by healthcare disparities, there are too many deaths. I think you said it so well when you provided the data and the statistics of African American men and their mortality rates and what is happening to them. And yes, African Americans lag behind, and that is why we stand with you bridging the gap and for this call of action. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) from the Second Congressional District, my colleague, my confidant, and my friend. She is a champion of expanding health care. She is a champion, Mr. Speaker, of making sure that we understand that healthcare disparities must end. She is the chair of the powerful and most prestigious Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust. She strives to increase healthcare opportunities for all: for our children, for our senior citizens, and for residents of the underserved communities. It is my honor to ask her to provide some information on today's topic. {time} 2000 Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues and my classmates, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), my friend, and the distinguished gentleman from New [[Page H3739]] York (Mr. Jeffries), for leading this important conversation about bridging the divide to eliminate racial health disparities. But I can't weigh in on that topic until I first address the horrific events of yesterday in Orlando, Florida. Our Nation is horrified and heartbroken by the tragedy in Orlando. We are disgusted by this brutal attack. We will not tolerate terrorism or hate in any form against any group of people because this is just not our way. These ideas of hate will not endure because there is not strength to them. We will win the battle against terrorism and intolerance. We will hold leaders accountable who put their NRA score ahead of the need to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists. We will stand with the LGBTQ community and value their lives, their health, and their security from the threat of violence and hate. And we will work to see that all Americans enjoy the very same freedoms and protections. We have done a lot of moments of silence, but I believe in showing respect through action, not silence, and that is why we are here this evening to discuss what divides us as a country in a health sense. For 45 years, the Congressional Black Caucus has been out front in Congress in fighting for these freedoms and protections. And when it comes to the matter of health equity, I have worked to champion the health policy concerns of vulnerable communities as my predecessors in the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, the Honorable Louis Stokes and Dr. Christensen, have done. Some of my colleagues here know this, but I want to repeat it for anyone who doesn't. Before he was killed, Martin Luther King, Jr., was quoted as saying: ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' I couldn't agree more, and as the chair of the Health Braintrust, I have worked with many of the people in this room to focus on advancing this critical phase of the human rights and civil rights struggle: health equity. When Benjamin Franklin created the Nation's first public hospital, The Pennsylvania Hospital, he did so in order to establish the promotion of public health as a core American value. He did so to care for our Nation's diseased and sick poor. Nearly 300 years later, the Affordable Care Act cemented health care as a fundamental right for all Americans. Yet, today, we find ourselves at a crossroads in health care. Health disparities in communities of color continue to be intractable hurdles in the quest to achieve health equity in America. African Americans are infected with HIV at a rate that is 8 times that of White Americans. While White women are more likely to have breast cancer, African American women are 40 percent more likely to die from the disease. African Americans, Latinos, Asians, and Pacific Islanders, as well as Native Americans, are diagnosed with lupus two to three times more frequently than Caucasians. More than 13 percent of African Americans aged 20 or older have diagnosed diabetes. And people of color are two to four times more likely than Whites to reach end-stage renal disease. This grim snapshot illustrates that, despite the gains we have made since the days of Ben Franklin and the ACA, there is still much ground to cover in closing the health equity gap. Last year, I drafted a comprehensive report, The Kelly Report on Health Disparities, an official Congressional analysis of the state of minority health in the U.S. that offers a blueprint for reversing negative health trends in communities of color. The Kelly Report brought Members of Congress together, medical professionals, and public health thought leaders to examine the root causes and impact of health disparities in America, and provide a comprehensive set of legislative and policy recommendations to address them. The whole can only ever be as healthy as its parts. For America to achieve true health equity, lawmakers, community leaders, and industry stakeholders must come together and aggressively work to reduce disparities nationwide. We all have a part to play in creating a healthier America. We must take heed of Dr. King's words: ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' And we can and we must fix that. Again, because of what happened in Orlando, and I want to say it is the mass shooting that we are talking about, and it is tragic, but the night before, one person was shot. And I often liken this to a 747 crash as we talk about that, but we don't talk about the two-seater. And that two-seater, the person that died alone in that club after she sung Friday night has a brother, a mother, a father, and their pain is just as harsh. So let's not forget that young lady that lost her life. And she did not lose her life to someone that was Muslim or someone that believed in ISIS. She lost her life to an American young man, a Caucasian. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois, (Ms. Kelly). And how appropriate for tonight for the gentlewoman to remind us, as I ask her to constantly do, about why we must, to put it in her words, come together. We must do something. Madam Speaker, tonight we say to you and to our Republican colleagues: Come together and do something. I say to the gentlewoman, Congresswoman Kelly: Let today serve as a turning point in our Nation's ongoing struggle to stamp out hate of all forms. We must mourn those who lost their family members, but we must do more than mourn. We must have action. If we are going to have a hope for a better America, hate has no place in this great Nation. So I thank the gentlewoman, and I will continue to remind others that we know firsthand what it does to our community. But, Madam Speaker, we stand here tonight speaking to all communities. But here is what we know. The NAACP has shared with us that African American children and teens accounted for 45 percent of all child and teen gun deaths in 2008 and 2009, but were only 15 percent of the total child population. The FBI says that approximately 47 percent of victims of the 165,000 homicides from 2000 to 2010, including over 111,000 gun-related homicides, were Black. The Children's Defense Fund, Madam Speaker, says that in 2010, Black males between the ages of 15 and 19 were nearly 30 times more likely to die in a gun homicide than White males of the same age, and more than three times more likely to die in a gun homicide than Hispanic males of the same age. So, Madam Speaker, tonight you will hear us repeatedly make a call for action. You will hear us repeatedly quote great leaders. And I think it is worth quoting again what Congresswoman Kelly said, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King: ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane'' of all inequalities, of all injustices. As we speak of great leaders, it is, indeed, my honor and my privilege to ask my colleague, the gentleman from the 10th Congressional District of New Jersey (Mr. Payne), a man who has made a name for himself, a man who understands firsthand as a father of triplets, as a spouse, as a ranking member on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, a man who has been at the forefront in his community, a man who served before coming here as an elected official, but, more importantly, a person who understands health disparities and the call for action--it gives me great honor to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) to share some wisdom with us tonight. Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I first want to start by thanking Congresswoman Beatty for that very kind and generous introduction. We, in our class, are very proud of our colleagues, and we support each other in times of need. I just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, the gentleman from New York, who is also host of this Special Order. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me. Before I begin, I just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible [[Page H3740]] tragedy in Orlando, and I can only imagine what they are going through. The other thing that is illuminating to me is that, as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence, after that moment of silence, I believe Members were given a 1-minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor, as is customary, and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in Orlando. So not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this House, but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle. Madam Speaker, eliminating racial-based health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all. Even in the 21st century, health disparities are stark, especially in the African American communities, where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among Whites. Today, despite improvement in overall health in the United States, African Americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas, including access to quality care, timelines of care, and health outcomes. For years, the Congressional Black Caucus has called on Republicans to join us and other House Democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities, a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities, such as inequities in environmental, social, and economic conditions in our communities. Instead, we get from them proposals like their so-called A Better Way poverty proposal, a stale, repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about Americans trapped in poverty. Cutting job training programs, food assistance, and Head Start will push low-income Americans further into poverty, making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their well-being and the well-being of their families. We need to, instead, use the government as a source of good. Every American deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment. Yet, low-income and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution, resulting in serious health problems such as asthma, heart problems, and cancer. This is a very real problem across America, a very real problem in my district. Thirteen million people, including 3.5 million children, are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution. {time} 2015 My district is home to the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, part of the Port of New York and New Jersey, the third largest port in the country. According to the EPA, 25 percent of children in Newark suffer from asthma--three times the State average. What we need are additional Federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system. The issue is critical to the low-income and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards. Now, since I am on the topic of environmental justice, I just want to remind everyone that the Republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in Flint, including a vote to block the Families of Flint Act emergency supplemental. Their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for American families, and, I think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities. The way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable. It is to address the environmental, social, and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities. It is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes. It is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations. In closing, Madam Speaker, I also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racial-based health disparities. African Americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor provider-patient communication and health literacy issues. Consequently, they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions. We have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find, understand, and use the information and services. As co-chair of the Congressional Men's Health Caucus, I have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and well-being. So I encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions, to get the security you and your family deserve, and to get the health care that we all need. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank Congressman Payne so much for giving us such compelling information and data and reminding us that the time is now for us to enact those programs that work, and the time is now for us to understand what is at risk. Also, let me thank the gentleman for his role on the Congressional Men's Health Caucus. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from the State of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The gentlewoman from the 18th Congressional District of Texas is someone who I am always amazed when she comes to the mic, someone who is well researched, and someone who delivers an oratorical message that makes us take pause and pay attention. Tonight, I would like to say that Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is a movement. Earlier, I heard her use that word in talk about how we, Madam Speaker, must be the movement against violence, that we must be leading that movement against these disparities in health care. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, there is no doubt how much I appreciate the Congressional Black Caucus and Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman Jeffries for always being timely in allowing us to give a message to our colleagues. We hope maybe the American people will hear us, but we accept that this body is the body to which and to whom we speak. So I am thankful for that. I want to pay tribute, overall, to the Congressional Black Caucus because we are actually here speaking of health disparities, because it was the caucus that triggered this debate through the years that we have been trying to get universal access to health care and was the moving force in the 2009, 2008, and 2010 passage, ultimately, of the Affordable Care Act, where the work that we did, joining Congresswoman Donna Christian-Christiansen, at that time, and Frank Pallone on the Congressional Health Caucus, but on the CBC we had the health disparities task to ensure that the language in the Affordable Care Act addressed the issue of health disparities. There was a large section on that that built on some of the work that some of us had already done creating the Office of Minority Health that I had worked on in years past. So it was the lightning bolt of the caucus, and then working with the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and then the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that we raised the issue that no one was talking about. I remember debating on the floor of the House on the issues of dealing with senior citizen African American men and how they access health care, how do women access health care, and how do women impacted by diabetes access health care. These are some of the diseases that have a proclivity to the African American population. We were finding out that we even had an issue where medical professionals didn't know how to ask the questions. How do you address someone who needs to be diagnosed for prostate cancer or may be diagnosed for prostate cancer and is an African American male, a senior citizen? My father ultimately died from cancer that metastasized from the prostate to the lungs and the brain, so we knew we had a serious issue. [[Page H3741]] So today, I want to mention four points, but I am going to focus on the last one, obesity--a question of access to health care and physical fitness. Many times we live in areas where there is no access to a pool or a tennis court. Mental health--if you lived your life in a segregated America, if you were called ``Boy'' and ``Girl,'' it is a different mental health situation than maybe others may have faced. If you live in a situation of poverty, of a single household, maybe--this is not across the board--these issues will be impacted. If you lived around gun violence, if you saw your 15-year-old friend being shot dead in the street, there is a question of mental health that we need access to that care for us to be able to reach out or maybe counselors to be able to provide for children. HIV/AIDS is something that we have lived through. I remember going to funerals of friends in the 1980s and into the 1990s, particularly with HIV/AIDS. So we have worked in the Congressional Black Caucus to massively talk about testing. Let me get to this point that I want to dwell just for a moment on, and that is gun violence. I was here on the floor earlier with my head held down and my heart heavy as my district, today, had a memorial. They had one yesterday. We will have one tomorrow and have one on Wednesday. I mourn with Congresswoman Corinne Brown of Florida. We are offering legislation dealing with the assault weapons and to complement legislation already passed or already in place. But it is important to note that this is a health issue, because the Centers for Disease Control can assess and study every health issue that faces America today, but they are legislatively, by law, prohibited by my friends on other side of the aisle, by Republicans, disallowed every year to give them permission to study gun violence. Gun violence is killing our children and killing our families. In Orlando, it killed Latinos who happened to be the attendees at the Pulse Club. The LGBTQ community was the dominant community, and a hateful terroristic act using AR-15s and Glock guns killed them. The incident was the deadliest mass shooting. The next deadliest incidents in recent history were April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech, 32 killed, 17 injured; December 14, 2012, Sandy Hook, 26 killed, 1 injured; October 16, 1991, Killeen, Texas, 23 killed, 27 injured. According to Everytown index of mass shootings where four or more people are shot and killed, the incident was the ninth mass shooting in the United States in 2016, and the 150th mass shooting in United States since January 1, 2009. The mass shooting with guns impacts both the mental health, the sanctity, and the minority community. It is shameful that we are not allowed to engage in the kind of research that a Harvard professor talked about, and that is the assessing of violence and the assessing of violence with guns. The materials I have before me make it very clear that most of these violent acts are done with guns--done with guns. San Bernardino, Chattanooga, Charleston, Garland, Oak Creek, and Fort Hood were all done with guns. So I stand here today to challenge this issue of health disparities to say that the heavy brunt of killings, singular killings, are impacted by poverty, lack of access to health care, the proliferation of guns in our inner city communities, and the failure of the United States Congress to put real gun safety legislation, closing the loophole, the Jim Clyburn rule that says that, if you don't get the review and approval by ATF, you do not get the gun. You have to wait until you get the approval from ATF, which may be trying to determine whether this person with multiple problems, mental health or background issues, doesn't need to get a gun and then ultimately go kill their spouse, their children, their neighbors, their family members or strangers. So it is my belief today that this health disparities debate is crucial, and we should come away from here recognizing that obesity, the issues of mental health and HIV/AIDS can be, with great investment, researched for cures, or cancer that proliferates in our community, triple negative breast cancer, legislation that I have put forward and have gotten passed about that impact. But it is the gun violence that we are doing absolutely nothing about. The disparities and the impact on minority communities is atrocious. I want to close simply by saying the word or the acronym LGBTQ community. I want to say it over and over again, because I think it is shameful that, in our debate, in our recognition of the tragedy of Orlando, that we don't acknowledge the horrific hate crime and the hatefulness against that community. As I stand here, that community is diverse, and there are African Americans who are LGBTQ. So I would ask that, as we move forward this week, we will be reminded of this hatefulness and we will have a cure. We will be reminded of this violence, and we will have a cure. That cure, first of all, will be to restrain the use of assault weapons and these weapons of war-type bullets that men and women in the United States military say have no business on the streets of America. I believe, Congresswoman, that health disparities are an important wall and division to overcome. I thank the gentlewoman for having this Special Order to ensure that we will confront these issues and try to save lives. Racial disparities refer to the variation in rates of disease occurrence and disabilities between socioeconomic and/or geographically defined population groups. I want to focus on four areas of racial disparities in health that impact African Americans that we can do something about: 1. Obesity; 2. Mental Health; 3. HIV/AIDS; and 4. Gun Violence. African Americans, based on 2015 Census data, comprise 13.2 percent of the U.S. population, or about 42 million people. Socioeconomic status, in turn, is linked to mental health: People who are impoverished, homeless, incarcerated or have substance abuse problems are at higher risk for poor mental health. As the founder and chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I am especially concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic among African-American youth. More than 40 percent of African American teenagers are overweight, and nearly 25 percent are obese. The percentage of children aged 6-11 years in the United States who were obese increased from 7 percent in 1980 to nearly 18 percent in 2012. African American youth are consuming less nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables and are not getting enough physical exercise. This combination has led to an epidemic of obesity, which directly contributes to numerous deadly or life-threatening diseases or conditions, including the following: Hypertension; Dyslipidemia (High Cholesterol or High Triglyceride Levels); Type 2 Diabetes; Coronary Heart Disease; Stroke; Gallbladder Disease; Osteoarthritis; Asthma, bronchitis, sleep apnea, and other respiratory problems; Cancer (Breast, Colon, and Endometrial). When ethnicity and income are considered, the picture is even more troubling. African American youngsters from low-income families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higher-income families. Efforts such as the Let's Move! Campaign by the First Lady are pivotal to ensuring that communities are able to provide healthy snacks and food and encourage healthier decisions. Since the mid-1970s, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children. Non-Hispanic blacks have the highest age-adjusted rates of obesity at 47.8 percent. According to the CDC, 37.6 percent of men and 56.9 percent of women twenty years and over are obese. Every year, more than 40 million Americans struggle with mental illness. African American men are as likely as anyone else to have mental illness, but they are less likely to get help. Racism continues to have an impact on the mental health of African Americans. Negative stereotypes and attitudes of rejection have decreased, but continue to occur with measurable, adverse consequences. Historical and contemporary instances of negative treatment have led to a mistrust of authorities, many of whom are not seen as having the best interests of African Americans in mind. According to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health: Adult blacks are 20 percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than adult whites. Adult blacks living below poverty are two to three times more likely to report serious psychological distress than those living above poverty. Adult blacks are more likely to have feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness than are adult whites. How African Americans view mental health over generations is a major barrier to accessing mental health services and treatment. [[Page H3742]] In 1996, MHA commissioned a national survey on clinical depression. The survey explored the barriers preventing Americans seeking treatment and gauged overall knowledge of and attitudes toward depression. This survey revealed that: 63 percent of African Americans believe that depression is a personal weakness. This is significantly higher than the overall survey average of 54 percent. Only 31 percent of African Americans believed that depression was a ``health problem.'' African Americans were more likely to believe that depression was ``normal'' than the overall survey average. 56 percent believed that depression was a normal part of aging. 45 percent believed it was normal for a mother to feel depressed for at least two weeks after giving birth. 40 percent believed it was normal for a husband or wife to feel depressed for more than a year after the death of a spouse. Many of these problems persist to this day. As Doctor William Lawson of Howard University (and MHA's District of Columbia affiliate) pointed out in an NPR interview in 2012, ``Many African-Americans have a lot of negative feelings about, or not even aware of mental health services. The ``Mental Health: Culture, Race and Ethnicity Supplement'' to the 1999 U.S. Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health, states the following: African-American physicians are five times more likely than white physicians to treat African-American patients. African-American patients who see African-American physicians rate their physicians' styles of interaction as more participatory. African Americans seeking help for a mental health problem would have trouble finding African American mental health professionals: In 1998, only 2 percent of psychiatrists, 2 percent of psychologists and 4 percent of social workers said they were African Americans. The public mental health safety net of hospitals, community health centers, and local health departments are vital to many African Americans, especially to those in high-need populations. African Americans of all ages are underrepresented in outpatient treatment but over-represented in inpatient treatment. Few African-American children receive treatment in privately funded psychiatric hospitals, but many receive treatment in publicly funded residential treatment centers for emotionally disturbed youth. In 2012, there were an estimated 356,268 inmates with severe mental illnesses in U.S. prisons and jails. There were only 35,000 mentally ill individuals in state psychiatric hospitals. The report, ``The Treatment of Persons With Mental Illness in Prisons and Jails,'' jails ``in 44 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, a prison or jail in that state holds more individuals with serious mental illness than the largest remaining state psychiatric hospital.'' the report said. African Americans today are overrepresented in our jails and prisons. People of color account for 60 percent of the prison population. The Stanford Law School Three Strikes Project's report stated that, ``over the past 15 years, the number of mentally ill people in prison in California has almost doubled.'' In California, 45 percent of state prison inmates have been treated for severe mental illness within the past year. African Americans also account for 14 percent of regular drug users, but for 37 percent of drug arrests. Illicit drug use is frequently associated with self-medication among people with mental illnesses. In January 2014, the Texas Observer reported that, of the 9,000 inmates in Harris County Jail more than 25 percent take medication for mental illness, which means that the jail treats more psychiatric patients than all 10 of Texas' state-run public mental hospitals combined. The passage of the Affordable Care Act created access to health care for those who purchase health insurance and for the poor living in states that are participating in the Medicaid component of the ACA. Disparities can occur, if physicians do not refer patients with signs of mental illness for proper treatment or if referred patients do not seek out treatment. Disparities in access to care and treatment for mental illnesses have also persisted over time. As noted by the Office of Minority Health: Only 8.7 percent of adult blacks, versus 16 percent of adult whites, received treatment for mental health concerns in 2007-2008. Only 6.2 percent of adult blacks, versus 13.9 percent of adult whites, received medications for mental health concerns during 2008. While 68.7 percent of adult whites with a major depressive episode in 2009 received treatment, only 53.2 percent of adult blacks did. The Affordable Care Act will have an impact on this gap by 2016. Depression and other mental illness can be deadly if left untreated. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among African Americans 15 to 24 years old. Untreated mental illness can also make African American men more vulnerable to substance abuse, homelessness, incarceration, and homicide. African Americas are the racial/ethnic group most affected by HIV in the United States. According to the CDC, 44 percent (19,540) of estimated new HIV Diagnoses in the United States were among African Americans, who comprise 12 percent of the US population. HIV/AIDs are now the leading cause of death among African Americans ages 25 to 44--ahead of heart disease, accidents, cancer, and homicide. At the end of 2012, an estimated 496,500 African Americans were living with HIV, representing 41 percent of all Americans living with the Virus. Of African Americans living with HIV, around 14 percent do not know they are infected. African Americans accounted for an estimated 44 percent of all new HIV infections among adults and adolescents (aged 13 years or older) in 2010, despite representing only 12 percent of the U.S. population. HIV is a sexually transmitted disease or STD; it is also spread through intravenous drug use. HIV infections spread through sharing of needles has declined with needle programs, while the STD rates of infection among African Americans has increased at rate higher than any other ethnic group. Have their HIV status checked--not once but annually. Know the HIV status of sexual partner. If HIV positive: Know how to get on antiviral medication, 2 small pills taken each day, and stay on them. Where to go for information if you or your partner is HIV positive. In 2010, men accounted for 70 percent (14,700) of the estimated 20,900 new HIV infections among all adult and adolescent African Americans. The estimated rate of new HIV infections for African American men (103.6/100,000 population) was 7 times that of white men, twice that of Latino men, and nearly 3 times that of African American women. In 2010, African American gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men represented an estimated 72 percent (10,600) of new infections among all African American men and 36 percent of an estimated 29,800 new HIV infections among all gay and bisexual men. Of those gay and bisexual men, 39 percent (4,321) were young men aged 13 to 24. According to the CDC, the numbers of new HIV diagnoses among African American women fell 42 percent between 2005 to 2014, but it is still high compared to women of other races/ethnicities. Most new HIV infections among African American women (87 percent; 5,300) are attributed to heterosexual contact. In 2012, there were 72,010 Texans living with HIV/AIDS. Texas has the 10th highest number of HIV diagnoses in 2013 and ranks 18th for deaths from HIV. Currently 14 percent of the people living with HIV are undiagnosed and only 30 percent of the people with HIV are virally suppressed, which means that 70 percent of the people who are ill are not on medication that can help limit their ability to infect others. HIV is an unnecessarily disproportionate burden on the African American and Latino community. There is a wall of misinformation about the illness and an uncomfortable silence regarding the need to speak about the illness not only to the young, but also the older persons. When treatments were first developed in the 1990s they had lots of side effects that made patients very ill. Few talk about the advances in HIV treatment that now involve taking 2 small pills a day with the result leaving patients feeling healthy and able to engage in life's normal activities. The virus count for those who take their medication is so low that it often does not register in tests. This does not mean that people are cured, but it does mean that there is no reason not to get tested so that you know if you are in need of treatment. Anyone can become infected--so it is up to all of us to educate our families, neighbors, co-workers and friends about getting tested. There are some insurance company practices that have a detrimental impact on the ability of people with HIV to enroll in qualified health insurance plans. In states like Texas that are not fully participating in the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid [[Page H3743]] expansion this is especially problematic for HIV patients who are poor. Some states allow insurance carriers to post misleading or intentionally vague formularies on market place websites or excluding essential HIV medications from drug formularies and impressing high cost sharing. Out of pocket medication cost each month should be capped. Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for reminding us that we should be done with guns like the assault weapons. I thank the gentlewoman for reminding us of the impact that health disparities have on our communities in this Nation. {time} 2030 Madam Speaker, I have two documents that will be entered into the Record. The first document is from Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson. I would like to state for the Record that she was the first nurse to serve in this United States Congress. And the second is a portion of the Special Feature on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities: 30 Years After the Heckler Report. Special Feature on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities: 30 Years After the Heckler Report Introduction The 1985 Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health, released by then Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler, documented significant disparities in the burden of illness and mortality experienced by blacks and other minority groups in the U.S. population compared with whites (41). The report laid out an ambitious agenda, including improving minority access to high-quality health care, expanding health promotion and health education outreach activities, increasing the number of minority health care providers, and enhancing federal and state data collection activities to better report on minority health issues. In the 30 years since the Heckler Report, national efforts to improve minority health through outreach, programming, and monitoring have included the formation of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Minority Health in 1986 (42); the annual National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports first issued in 2003 (43); the adoption of disparities elimination as an overarching goal of Healthy People 2010 (44); and most recently, an HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities--a comprehensive federal commitment to reduce and eventually eliminate disparities in health and health care (45). Race is a social construct influenced by a complex set of factors (46,47). Because of the complexity and difficulty in conceptualizing and defining race, as well as the increasing representation of racial and ethnic subgroups in the United States, racial classification and data collection systems continue to evolve and expand. In 1977, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) required that all federal data collection efforts collect data on a minimum of four race groups (American Indian or Alaskan Native, black, Asian or Pacific Islander, and white) and did not allow the reporting of more than one race (48). In 1997, in response to growing interest in more detailed reporting on race and ethnicity, OMB mandated data collection for a minimum of five race groups, splitting Asian or Pacific Islander into two categories (Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) (49). In addition, the 1997 standards allowed respondents to report more than one race. A minimum of two categories for data collection on ethnicity, ``Hispanic or Latino'' and ``Not Hispanic or Latino,'' were also required under the 1997 OMB standards. Consequently, whereas the Heckler Report primarily documented black-white differences in health and mortality due to data limitations, this Special Feature is able to report on more detailed racial and ethnic groups. For example, Figures 19-21 display trends in infant mortality and low-risk cesarean section deliveries, and the current data on preterm births for five Hispanic-origin groups. At the time of the Heckler Report, 22.3% of the population were considered racial or ethnic minorities (Table 1). Current Census (2014) estimates identify 37.9% of the population as racial or ethnic minorities (50). In 2014, Hispanic persons, who may be of any race, comprised 17.4% of the U.S. population. Non-Hispanic multiple race persons were 2.0% of the population. For the single race groups, non- Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons were 0.7%, non-Hispanic Asian persons were 5.3%, non-Hispanic black persons were 12.4%, non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander persons were 0.2%, and non-Hispanic white persons were 62.1% of the U.S. population in 2014 (50). Understanding the demographic and socioeconomic composition of U.S. racial and ethnic groups is important because these characteristics are associated with health risk factors, disease prevalence, and access to care, which in turn drive health care utilization and expenditures. Non-Hispanic white persons are, on average, older than those in other racial and ethnic groups, with a median age of 43.1 years, and Hispanic individuals are the youngest, with a median age of 28.5 years in 2014 (50). About one-quarter of black only persons (26.2%) and Hispanic persons (23.6%) lived in poverty compared with 10.1% of non-Hispanic white only persons and 12.0% of Asian only persons in 2014 (51). Non-Hispanic black only children and Hispanic children were particularly likely to live in poverty (37.3% and 31.9%, respectively, in 2014) (52). However, Hispanic individuals are often found to have quite favorable health and mortality patterns in comparison with non-Hispanic white persons and particularly with non-Hispanic black persons, despite having a disadvantaged socioeconomic profile--a pattern termed the epidemiologic paradox (53). HHS defines a racial or ethnic health disparity as ``a particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage. Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group'' (54). There are many different ways to measure racial and ethnic differences in health and mortality, which can lead to different conclusions (55-58). This Special Feature on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (Special Feature) uses the maximal rate difference, one of three overall measures used in Healthy People 2020 to measure differences among groups of people (see Technical Notes). The maximal rate difference is an overall measure of health disparities calculated as the absolute difference between the highest and lowest group rates in the population for a given characteristic (59). The identification of groups that experience the highest and lowest rates in this Special Feature was based on observed rates and was not tested for a statistically significant difference against other rates. Ties in highest or lowest rates were resolved by examining decimal places. With respect to changes in health disparities over time, tracking the maximal rate difference over time enables one to determine whether the absolute difference between the highest and lowest group rates is increasing, decreasing, or stable. The Special Feature charts that follow provide detailed comparisons of key measures of mortality, natality, health conditions, health behaviors, and health care access and utilization, by race, race and ethnicity, or by detailed Hispanic origin, depending on data availability. A majority of the 10 graphs in this year's Special Feature present trends in health from 1999-2014. Results indicate that trends in health were generally positive for the overall population and several graphs illustrate success in narrowing gaps in health by racial and ethnic group. Differences in life expectancy, infant mortality, cigarette smoking among women, influenza vaccinations among those aged 65 and over, and health insurance coverage narrowed among the racial and ethnic groups. For example, the absolute difference in infant mortality rates between infants born to non-Hispanic black mothers (highest rate) and infants born to non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander mothers (lowest rate) narrowed between 1999-2014. Differences by racial and ethnic group in the prevalence of high blood pressure and smoking among adult men remained stable throughout the study period, with non- Hispanic black adults more likely to have high blood pressure than adults in other racial and ethnic groups throughout the period, and non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white males more likely to be current smokers than Hispanic and non- Hispanic Asian men. For low-risk cesarean sections, influenza vaccinations among adults aged 18-64, and unmet dental care needs, the gap widened among the racial and ethnic groups between 1999-2014. Despite improvements over time in many of the health measures presented in this Special Feature, disparities by race and ethnicity were found in the most recent year for all 10 measures, indicating that although progress has been made in the 30 years since the Heckler Report, elimination of disparities in health and access to health care has yet to be achieved. Life Expectancy at Birth In 2014, life expectancy was longer for Hispanic men and women than for non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black men and women. Life expectancy is a measure often used to gauge the overall health of a population. Life expectancy at birth represents the average number of years that a group of infants would live if the group were to experience the age- specific death rates present in the year of birth. Differences in life expectancy among various demographic subpopulations, including racial and ethnic groups, may reflect subpopulation differences in a range of factors such as socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and the prevalence of specific risk factors in a particular subpopulation (60,61). During 1980-2014, life expectancy at birth in the United States increased from 70.0 to 76.4 years for males and from 77.4 to 81.2 years for females (Table 15, and data table for Figure 18). During this period, life expectancy at birth for males and females was longest for white persons and shortest for black persons. For both males and females, racial differences in life expectancy at birth narrowed, but persisted during 1980-2014. Life expectancy at birth was 6.9 years longer for white males than for black males in 1980, and this difference narrowed to 4.2 years in 2014. [[Page H3744]] In 1980, life expectancy at birth was 5.6 years longer for white females than for black females, and this difference narrowed to 3.0 years in 2014. In 2014, Hispanic males and females had the longest life expectancy at birth, and non-Hispanic black males and females had the shortest. In 2014, life expectancy at birth was 7.2 years longer for Hispanic males than for non-Hispanic black males and 5.9 years longer for Hispanic females than for non- Hispanic black females. Infant Mortality During 1999-2013, infant mortality rates were highest among infants born to non-Hispanic black women (11.11 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2013). Infant mortality, the death of a baby before his or her first birthday, is an important indicator of the health and wellbeing of a country. It not only measures the risk of infant death but it is used as an indicator of maternal health, community health status, and availability of quality health services and medical technology (62,63). The infant mortality rate in the United States decreased from 7.04 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999 to 6.75 in 2007, and then decreased at a faster rate to 5.96 in 2013. Trends in infant mortality rates during 1999-2013 varied among the five racial and ethnic groups. During 1999-2013, infants born to non-Hispanic black mothers experienced the highest rates of infant mortality (11.11 in 2013) and infants born to non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander mothers experienced the lowest rates (3.90 in 2013). The difference between the highest and lowest infant mortality rates among the five racial and ethnic groups was stable from 1999 to 2006 and then narrowed from 2006 to 2013. The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (non- Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander) infant mortality rates was 9.41 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999, compared with 7.21 in 2013. For infants born to Hispanic mothers, the infant mortality rate remained stable during 1999-2008 (5.71 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999) and then decreased to 5.00 in 2013. During 1999-2013, the infant mortality rate for Hispanic infants varied by the mother's Hispanic-origin group. Throughout this period, infants born to Puerto Rican mothers experienced the highest mortality rates. In all years except 2009, infants born to Cuban mothers and those born to Central and South American mothers experienced the lowest mortality rates at alternate times throughout 1999-2013. The difference between the highest (Puerto Rican) and lowest (Cuban) infant mortality rates among Hispanic-origin groups narrowed from 3.71 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999 to 2.88 in 2013. During 1999-2013, the difference in infant mortality rates was narrower for mothers in the Hispanic- origin groups than for mothers in the five racial and ethnic groups. Preterm Births In 2014, non-Hispanic black mothers had the highest percentage of preterm births of the five racial and ethnic groups, and Puerto Rican mothers had the highest percentage of preterm births of the five Hispanic-origin groups. An infant's gestational age is an important predictor of his or her survival and subsequent health (64-70). Preterm birth prior to 37 weeks gestation affects infant mortality rates and racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality (Figure 19) (71). The degree of prematurity matters--infants born prior to 32 weeks gestation are at greatest risk of death during infancy, with the risk of infant death decreasing as gestational age increases (72). In 2014, 7.7% of singleton births occurred before 37 weeks of gestation; 5.7% at 34-36 weeks; 0.8% at 32-33 weeks gestation; and 1.2% before 32 weeks (data table for Figure 20). In 2014, among the five racial and ethnic groups, non- Hispanic black women had the highest percentage of singleton births before 37 weeks (11.1%) and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander women had the lowest percentage (6.8%). Non- Hispanic black women also had the highest percentage of singleton preterm births at each preterm gestational age. The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander) percentages of singleton preterm births among the five racial and ethnic groups was 4.3 percentage points (before 37 weeks), 2.0 percentage points (34-36 weeks), 0.6 percentage points (32-33 weeks), and 1.7 percentage points (before 32 weeks). Among Hispanic-origin groups in 2014, Puerto Rican mothers had the highest percentage of singleton births before 37 weeks (9.1%) and Cuban mothers had the lowest percentage (7.2%). The difference between the highest (Puerto Rican) and lowest (Cuban) percentages of singleton preterm births among the Hispanic-origin groups was 1.9 percentage points (before 37 weeks) and 1.3 percentage points (34-36 weeks). Central and South American mothers had the lowest percentage of singleton births before 34 weeks. For preterm births before 34 weeks, the difference between the highest (Puerto Rican) and lowest (Central and South American) percentages was 0.2 percentage points (32-33 weeks) and 0.6 percentage points (before 32 weeks). Low-risk Births Delivered by Cesarean Section During 1999-2014 non-Hispanic black mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries among the five racial and ethnic groups (29.9% in 2014); Cuban mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries among the five Hispanic-origin groups (41.49-6 in 2014). Cesarean deliveries comprise approximately one-third of all births in the United States (32.2% in 2014) and can place mothers and infants at increased risk for poor health outcomes (74). Over the past decade, professional medical groups have attempted to reduce low-risk cesarean deliveries defined as cesarean deliveries among full term (37 or more completed weeks of gestation), singleton, vertex (head first) births to women giving birth for the first time (75,76). The percentage of low-risk births that were delivered by cesarean section increased from 19.5% to 26.6% during 1999- 2005, stabilized during 2005-2009, and then decreased to 26.0% in 2014 (data table for Figure 21). Throughout the period 1999-2014, non-Hispanic black mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries (29.9% in 2014) among the five racial and ethnic groups, while non- Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native mothers experienced the lowest percentage (21.5% in 2014). The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native) percentages widened from 4.8 percentage points in 1999 to 8.4 percentage points in 2014. Among Hispanic mothers, the percentage of low-risk births that were delivered by cesarean section increased from 18.7% to 24.6% during 1999-2004, increased at a slower rate from 2004-2009, and then remained stable during 2009-2014 (data table for Figure 21). Throughout the period 1999-2014 Cuban mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries (41.4% in 2014), while Mexican mothers experienced the lowest percentage (24.1% in 2014). Among Hispanic-origin groups, the difference between the highest and lowest percentages of low-risk cesarean deliveries was stable during 1999-2002, widened sharply during 2002-2006, and then narrowed during 2006-2014. The difference between the highest (Cuban) and lowest (Mexican) percentages was 11.7 percentage points in 1999, 21.5 percentage points in 2006, and 17.3 percentage points in 2014. Children and Adolescents With Obesity In 2011-2014 for children and adolescents aged 2-19 years, Hispanic children and adolescents had the highest prevalence of obesity and non-Hispanic Asian children had the lowest prevalence. Childhood obesity is a serious public health challenge in the United States and many other industrialized nations in the world (Figure 8) (19,77,78). Excess body weight in children is associated with excess morbidity in childhood and excess body weight in adulthood (13,14). Obesity among children and adolescents is defined as a body mass index at or above the sex- and age-specific 95th percentile of the CDC growth charts (15). Between 1999-2000 and 2013-2014, the percentage of children and adolescents aged 2-19 with obesity increased from 13.9% to 17.2% (79). However, among youth aged 2-19, the prevalence of obesity did not change from 2003-2004 through 2013-2014 (79). In 2011-2014 for children and adolescents aged 2-19, the percentage with obesity was highest for Hispanic children and adolescents and lowest for non-Hispanic Asian children and adolescents. For those aged 2-19, the difference between the highest (Hispanic) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) percentages was 13.3 percentage points. For children aged 2-5, the percentage with obesity was highest for Hispanic children and lowest for non-Hispanic white children. (The estimate for non-Hispanic Asian children aged 2-5 was not stable and is not shown.) The difference between the highest (Hispanic) and lowest (non-Hispanic white) percentages was 10.4 percentage points for children aged 2-5. For children aged 6-11, the percentage with obesity was highest for Hispanic children and lowest for non-Hispanic Asian children. For children aged 6-11, the difference between the highest (Hispanic) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) percentages was 15.2 percentage points. In 2011-2014 for adolescents aged 12-19, the percentage with obesity was highest for Hispanic adolescents and lowest for non-Hispanic Asian adolescents. The difference between the highest (Hispanic) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) percentages was 13.4 percentage points for adolescents aged 12-19 years. Hypertension In 2011-2014, non-Hispanic black men and women were the most likely to have hypertension compared with adults in the other racial and ethnic groups. Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure, and other health conditions (80,81). In 2011-2014, 84.1% of adults with hypertension were aware of their status, and 76.1% were taking medication to lower their blood pressure (82). Despite improvement in increasing the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension among minority groups remains a challenge (83). Hypertension is defined as reporting taking antihypertensive medication and/or having a measured systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg or a measured diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg. The age-adjusted percentage of adults aged 20 and over with hypertension was stable during 1999-2014 (30.8% in 2013-2014) (data table for Figure 23). During 1999-2014, non-Hispanic black adults had the highest percentage with [[Page H3745]] hypertension among the three racial and ethnic groups (42.7%, age-adjusted in 2013-2014), while with the exception of 1999- 2000, adults of Mexican origin had the lowest percentage with hypertension (28.8%, age-adjusted in 2013-2014). The difference between the highest and lowest age-adjusted percentages of adults with hypertension among the three racial and ethnic groups was stable during 1999-2014; in 2013-2014, the difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (Mexican-origin) percentages was 13.9 percentage points. In 2011-2014, the age-adjusted percentage of adult men and women with hypertension was similar (31.0% and 29.7%, respectively, data table for Figure 23). The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (Hispanic) age-adjusted percentages of men with hypertension among the four racial and ethnic groups was 14.7 percentage points; for women, the difference between the highest (non- Hispanic black) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) was 19.0 percentage points in 2011-2014. Current Cigarette Smoking During 1999-2014, differences in cigarette smoking between racial and ethnic groups were larger for women than for men. Smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year, accounting for about one in five deaths in the United States (84). Smokers are more likely to develop heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Smoking also increases the risk for diabetes, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis, and stillbirth (85). During 1999-2014, the age-adjusted percentage of adults aged 18 and over who were current cigarette smokers decreased from 25.2% to 19.0% for men and from 21.6% to 15.1% for women (data table for Figure 24). Within each of the four racial and ethnic groups, men were more likely to be current cigarette smokers than women. In 2014 for men, the age-adjusted percentage of current cigarette smokers was highest for non-Hispanic black men (22.0%) and lowest for Hispanic men (13.8%). The difference between the highest and lowest age-adjusted percentages of current cigarette smokers among the four racial and ethnic groups remained stable during 1999-2014 because levels for men in all racial and ethnic groups declined similarly during this period. The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (Hispanic) percentages for men was 8.2 percentage points in 2014. For women, non-Hispanic white women consistently had the highest age-adjusted percentage of current cigarette smokers among the four racial and ethnic groups throughout 1999-2014 (18.3% in 2014), while non-Hispanic Asian women had the lowest age-adjusted percentage (5.1% in 2014). For women, the difference between the highest (non-Hispanic white) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) percentages narrowed from 17.5 percentage points in 1999 to 13.2 in 2014. During 1999-2014, racial and ethnic differences in cigarette smoking prevalence were larger for women than for men. Influenza Vaccination During 1999-2014, influenza vaccination was highest for those aged 65 and over and lowest for those aged 18-64, for all racial and ethnic groups. Influenza is a serious illness that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. Influenza vaccination is especially important for people who are at risk of getting seriously ill from influenza, including those with chronic conditions, older adults, and young children. The percentage of adults aged 18-64 who received an influenza vaccination in the past 12 months remained stable during 1999-2006 and then increased to 35.8% in 2014 (data table for Figure 25). This pattern was present for all racial and ethnic groups. Decreases in influenza vaccination coverage in 2005 were related to a vaccine shortage (86). For those aged 18-64, no racial and ethnic group was consistently the most likely to receive influenza vaccination during 1999- 2014. In 2014, non-Hispanic Asian adults had the highest percentage for influenza vaccination receipt (41.3%) and Hispanic adults had the lowest percentage (27.9%). For adults aged 18-64, the difference between the highest and lowest percentages of adults receiving an influenza vaccination among the four racial and ethnic groups widened from 6.9 percentage points in 1999 (non-Hispanic white compared with Hispanic) to 13.4 in 2014 (non-Hispanic Asian compared with Hispanic). For adults aged 65 and over, the percentage who received an influenza vaccination in the past 12 months increased from 65.7% to 70.1% during 1999-2014. During this period, trends in influenza vaccination coverage varied by racial and ethnic group, and no racial and ethnic group was consistently the most or least likely to receive influenza vaccination. In 2014, non-Hispanic Asian adults had the highest percentage for receipt of influenza vaccination (72.7%) and non-Hispanic black adults had the lowest (57.4%). For adults age 65 and over, the difference between the highest (non-Hispanic Asian) and lowest (non-Hispanic black) percentages of older adults receiving an influenza vaccination among the four racial and ethnic groups was stable during 1999-2003 and then narrowed to 15.3 percentage points in 2014. Health Insurance Coverage During 1999 through the first 6 months of 2015 among adults aged 18-64, lack of health insurance coverage was highest among Hispanic adults. Health insurance is a major determinant of access to health care. Children are less likely to be uninsured than adults aged 18-64 because they are more likely to qualify for public coverage, primarily Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (see data table for Figure 26 for estimates for children) (26,87). Passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 (38) authorized states to expand Medicaid eligibility (88) and to establish the health insurance marketplace in 2014. For adults aged 18-64, the percentage without coverage increased from 17.9% to 20.5% during 1999-2013, and then decreased to 12.7% in the first 6 months of 2015 (36). During this period, the trend for lack of coverage varied by racial and ethnic group. During 1999-June 2015, Hispanic adults aged 18-64 had the highest percentage without coverage (27.2% in the first 6 months of 2015), and non-Hispanic white adults aged 18-64 had the lowest, except in the first 6 months of 2015, when non- Hispanic Asian adults had the lowest percentage without coverage. The difference between the highest and lowest percentages of adults aged 18-64 without health insurance among the four racial and ethnic groups narrowed from 1999-June 2015. This difference was 24.9 percentage points in 1999 (Hispanic adults compared with non-Hispanic white adults) and 19.9 percentage points in the first 6 months of 2015 (Hispanic adults compared with non-Hispanic Asian adults). Difficulty Accessing Needed Dental Care Due to Cost During 1999-2014 among adults aged 18-64, nonreceipt of needed dental care due to cost was lowest among non-Hispanic Asian adults. Oral health is integral to general health and wellbeing, and forgoing needed dental health care can have serious health effects (89). In general, fewer adults have dental coverage than medical coverage, and dental coverage tends to be less comprehensive (90-92). In 2012, 44% of dental expenditures among adults aged 18-64 were paid out of pocket, a higher out-of-pocket percentage than for any other type of personal health care expenditure (93). The percentage of adults aged 18-64 who did not receive needed dental care in the past 12 months due to cost increased from 9.3% to 17.3% during 1999-2010, and then decreased to 12.6% in 2014 (data table for Figure 27). During 1999-2014, non-Hispanic Asian adults aged 18-64 had the lowest percentage of not receiving needed dental care due to cost (6.3% in 2014) among the four racial and ethnic groups. No racial and ethnic group consistently had the highest percentage of not receiving needed dental care due to cost during 1999-2014. The difference between the highest and lowest percentages of adults not receiving needed dental care due to cost among the four racial and ethnic groups widened during 1999-2010, and then remained stable from 2010-2014 for those aged 18-64. This difference was 5.9 percentage points in 1999 (non-Hispanic black compared with non-Hispanic Asian) and 9.4 percentage points in 2014 (Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic Asian). Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot tonight. We have heard the call to action by Members. We have heard the relationship to poverty in health disparities, to the socioeconomic conditions of African Americans to health disparities. We have heard the relationship to death by guns to health disparities. We have heard the data and the statistics about the mortality rates from diseases like cardiovascular disease, the leading killer for women and African American women and men. We have heard about the effect of untreated diabetes and how that affects African Americans. The list goes on and on, Madam Speaker. I could tell you whether it is obesity, whether it is stroke--and certainly as a stroke survivor, I understand firsthand the value and the importance of quality, affordable health care--that there are some Federal programs that actually work and bridge the gap. I could say wonderful things about the United States Health and Human Services Office of Minority Affairs that provides data and research and services for us. But before I ask my colleague, Madam Speaker, to say a few words, I ran across something that was said, in my opinion, by one of the most powerful individuals that will go down in current history. And 20 years from now, Madam Speaker, if I were standing here talking about his legacy, health care would be one of them. Let me conclude my part with these brief words that he quoted on April 1 of this year: ``Our Nation was built on an enduring belief that we are all created equal--regardless of the color of our skin or the station into which we were born. From the ambitions we hold for ourselves to the way we take care of our health, this founding premise serves as the guidepost of our national life.'' Yet, to this day, Madam Speaker, minorities continue to experience the [[Page H3746]] healthcare gaps that leave their communities our communities. I will add this to his ending that, Madam Speaker, tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus asks that we recommit to taking action to overcome these disparities. And that person who will leave a great legacy for these words is no other than our President of these United States, President Barack Obama. And now as we begin to close our hour, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries). I could not think of a better colleague, a better coanchor, to come and share with us our call to action. My colleague and classmate, Congressman Jeffries, is a scholar, someone who sits back, listens, and then comes with resolve. He is someone who is no stranger to this process of telling it like it is. He is someone who has spent a lot of time and years with his experience to speak for the individuals of his district. But tonight, Madam Speaker, I asked him to speak for the Congressional Black Caucus. I asked him to close us out on our call for action as we talk about the health disparities in our African American communities. Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio, and our phenomenal anchor for this CBC Special Order hour today and throughout the second session of the 114th Congress. It has been an honor and a privilege to work closely with her. She has done such a phenomenal job, not just on behalf of the people she represents in the great city of Columbus, Ohio, but all throughout the Nation in her various roles, and certainly in her leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus. It is with a heavy heart that I stand on the floor of the House of Representatives today and, with great sadness, acknowledge the pain and the suffering and extend my condolences to those who have suffered this great tragedy in Orlando, Florida, the worst mass shooting in the history of the United States of America. It is a complicated shooting. We understand that it most likely is an act of terror, a hate crime of unspeakable proportions. There are indications that the shooter may have some degree of mental illness and a history of domestic abuse. The shooter appeared to have been, in some measure, on the FBI's radar. But you can add all those things up and there is still something that is missing that we here in Congress have the capacity to deal with, and that is the fact that one individual was able to purchase a weapon of mass destruction--which should be reserved for war, not the hunting of human beings in this great democratic Republic--and inflict death on 49 individuals and maim in ways that are inhumane to more than 50 others. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said: ``In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.'' During the 114th Congress, there have been more than 100 mass shootings. We often come to the floor of the House of Representatives and the Speaker or one of his designees stands at the rostrum and asks us, as Members of the House, to stand in a moment of silence. And then we go on with business as usual, having done nothing about the tremendous gun violence problem that we have in America. The rest of the world is looking around and saying: What are they doing in the United States of America? Five percent of the world's population, 50 percent of the world's guns. It is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns circulating throughout this great land. The FBI and local law enforcement can't tell you where the overwhelming majority of them are because of legislative silence and malpractice. This is an issue, of course, that has great impact on the African American community. Homicides are the leading cause of death through guns of younger African American men. So we in the CBC view it as a public health crisis certainly for our community. I think it is one that all Americans should view as a health crisis for the entire country. But the thing that is also troubling--and we will have time to deal with this tragedy--is hopefully we will be able to take some commonsense steps in the right direction, including making sure that individuals who are on the terrorist watch list can't purchase weapons of mass destruction. How complicated is that to do? But the thing that is striking for many of us in the African American community is that, when you look at some of the leading causes of death--heart disease being number one, and then, of course, diabetes and childhood obesity being problematic, certain forms of cancer, HIV/ AIDS infection--many of these illnesses, these ailments that plague the neighborhoods that I represent in central Brooklyn, in Bedford- Stuyvesant, in East New York, in Ocean Hill-Brownsville, in Canarsie, and in the west end of Coney Island, are preventable, preventable by better exercise, preventable by dealing with some of the environmental racism that many low-income communities of color have been subjected to, resulting in incredibly high rates of asthma and other forms of respiratory illness, preventable by better diet. Senator Booker recently said to many of us--and this has stuck with me--that more African Americans in the United States of America die as a result of drive-throughs, not drive-bys. That is because the diet, the access to healthy food, is limited. The food deserts within which many African Americans, particularly at the lowest socioeconomic level, are forced to reside in are scandalous. So we in the Congressional Black Caucus believe that we have to deal with these issues in a more meaningful, comprehensive fashion. I am thankful that back at home in the west end of Coney Island, Coney Island Cathedral, one of the most important religious institutions in Brooklyn, is actively engaged in a public health campaign to deal with diabetes and heart disease and many of the other ailments that result from a poor diet that exists, a lack of access to healthy food in the Black community. It is a campaign that we want to take across the Nation. We are thankful for the work that has been done by the Congressional Black Caucus and by President Obama through his leadership of the Affordable Care Act. We now know that over 20 million previously uninsured Americans now have access to quality, affordable health care--disproportionately African American. That is a positive step in the right direction. But instead of trying to dismantle this monumental step forward, as House Republicans have attempted to do more than 60 times over the last few years, they have a clinical obsession with a law that has been declared constitutional-- not once, but twice--by the United States Supreme Court. Let's figure out ways to come together as a nation, despite our racial, religious, and ethnic differences, to deal with the disparities that exist in the African American community and beyond. And let us come together as a Congress and as a nation to deal with the scourge of hate, in its most recent form, directed at the LGBT community down in Orlando in such a horrific and invidious fashion. We are better than this. We can do much better here in the United States Congress. The Congressional Black Caucus is here to lead the way on issues, worked in partnership hand in hand with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if they are just willing to meet us some of the way, to deal with the issues of health disparities in the African American community and deal with the scourge of gun violence that takes our young boys and girls in shocking numbers and also impacts people all across the country. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her leadership and for once again yielding to me and anchoring this Special Order in such a phenomenal way. Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Jeffries. Madam Speaker, as we close out tonight, I can't think of a better way to take my last 30 seconds than to speak to you and to speak to America and to ask that we take these last seconds in silence as a call to action to prevent the guns being on the street, as a call to action to reduce the health disparities. But in honor of the families in Orlando, we give them our commitment that we stand with them and that I stand with all of my friends and constituents and supporters who belong to the LGBT community. [[Page H3747]] I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of the special order hour titled ``Bridging the Divide: A Call to Action by the Congressional Black Caucus to Eliminate Racial Health Disparities.'' I would like to thank my colleagues Congressman Hakeem Jeffries and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty for hosting this timely special order. Historically, racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have the highest uninsured rates and are less likely to receive preventive and quality health care. While the Affordable Care Act has helped minorities afford health insurance and access quality care, there is still a need to eliminate existing disparities. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services is currently working to expand access, end racial and ethnic discrimination, perform outreach to underserved communities, improve workforce diversity, and expand data collection and reporting. While this is an ambitious plan, it is one that is extremely necessary. Unfortunately, coverage, access, and outreach may not be the only keys to eliminating disparities. Demographic characteristics contribute heavily to racial and ethnic health status. For example, research shows that privately insured African American and Hispanic adults fare worse than privately insured white adults along measures to access and use of care. Unfortunately, African Americans and Hispanics are less likely to have a regular provider than their white counterparts. The same research also showed that privately insured African Americans and Hispanics had less confidence in their ability to pay for medical costs. Since social determinants like economic stability, education, and environment play such a large role in how we each view and access health care, many of the changes necessary to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities require a much larger plan than just a focus on health-related programs. Reducing disparities in health truly entails addressing racial and ethnic social determinants such as availability of safe housing, affordable food, access to education, job opportunities, community-based resources, public safety, public transportation, and more. Our society must make many changes before we can truly eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities because that also means eliminating disparities in many other sectors. I thank Congressman Jeffries and Congresswoman Beatty for hosting this poignant special order. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3737-H3747] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 BRIDGING THE DIVIDE: A CALL TO ACTION BY THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS TO ELIMINATE RACIAL HEALTH DISPARITIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous materials relevant to the subject matter of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening, along with my colleague, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of the Eighth Congressional District of New York, for tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, Bridging the Divide: A Call to Action By the Congressional Black Caucus to Eliminate Racial Health Disparities. Mr. Speaker, tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor to discuss our overarching goal of promoting equality for African Americans across the healthcare spectrum. Mr. Speaker, it is well known that poverty, socioeconomic status, and health disparities are closely linked and latched together. For example, individuals with low incomes tend to have more restricted access to medical care and face greater financial barriers to affordable health care, oftentimes contributing to health disparities. Last week, Mr. Speaker, the House Republicans released their Conference's poverty plan called A Better Way. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, this Republican antipoverty proposal isn't a better way, Mr. Speaker. It isn't even a new way. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, it is the wrong way. It uses the same trickle-down, discredited policies that House Republicans have put forth in the past. The House Republicans' poverty elimination proposal would repeal the Affordable Care Act and undermine affordable, quality health coverage that millions of Americans are now enjoying. It would also cut Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program that we refer to as CHIP, and it would end the Medicare guarantee--programs with proven successes, Mr. Speaker, in reducing health disparities. So this is, in part, why we are here tonight. We know that health coverage is the first step in securing better healthcare outcomes, and Medicaid and CHIP play a vital role in opening the doorway to the needed health care, especially for our children. As we address the most pressing challenges in achieving health equity and equality for African Americans, I want hardworking American families to know that they have voices in Congress that aim to protect their safety, invest in their future, and provide affordable health care for all. With the Affordable Care Act, which every member of the Congressional Black Caucus supported when it passed, we have improved access. We have improved affordability and quality of health care. So tonight, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank President Obama for moving the needle forward in helping American families and African American families across this great country and Nation to have the financial and health security that comes with health care. [[Page H3738]] Mr. Speaker, we cannot repeal the ACA. We must continue to improve and strengthen it, and we will still have more work to do. The Congressional Black Caucus, from its very inception, has long been the voice for bridging the divide on racial healthcare disparities. No, Mr. Speaker; we have been the voice for standing up for American people, and especially individuals who are African American, against all disparities. We will not only come to this floor tonight. We will continue our fight and we will continue to come to this floor. Tonight, you are going to hear a lot of our members weave together our poverty plan. You are going to have members talk about gun violence. You are going to have members talk about all lives matter. If we don't end the gun violence, then we are not going to have a healthy nation. Tonight, I want to applaud my good friend and colleague, Congresswoman Robin Kelly of the Second District of Illinois, chair of our Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust. I want to commend her for her report, the 2015 Kelly Report on Health Disparities in America, the official congressional analysis of the state of African Americans' health in the United States, and her work on the 40 Under 40 Leaders in Health Awards, leaders under 40 who are physicians and medical professionals. And lastly, let me just thank her for her courage and her leadership for recognizing that all lives matter. We cannot come to this House floor and talk about poverty programs and health care and education and about finance if we do not bridge the gap with gun violence. I salute her for no longer standing up until we make a difference. So tonight, we are coming, Mr. Speaker, with a strong call to action for us to keep this wonderful America healthy. You will hear from Congresswoman Kelly momentarily. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. He is a chairman who has been a longtime advocate and voice for not only the Congressional Black Caucus, but for his constituents in his congressional district in North Carolina. Tonight, he speaks for us. Tonight, he speaks for the call of action of us to bridge the gap. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. I thank Congresswoman Beatty for yielding to me this evening. This is such a sad evening for all of us because of the events in Orlando. I thank her so very much for having the strength to come to the floor tonight to manage the important topic that we are all so concerned about. I thank Congresswoman Robin Kelly for her incredible work chairing the CBC Health Braintrust and all the work she does related to health disparities in this country. I thank all of my colleagues for their tireless work. Before I begin my remarks, let me just say that I sat on the floor a moment ago and listened to Congresswoman Corrine Brown. It was an incredible 1-minute speech she gave. I want to share in her sentiments this evening and align myself with the pain that she and her constituents are facing in Orlando. The mass shootings were absolutely horrific and unthinkable, under any definition. They are just unthinkable. My prayers go out to the families in Orlando for their pain and for all that they are having to endure because of these mass shootings. As someone said a few moments ago, a moment of silence is not enough. It is time for this Congress to act. It is time for this body, Mr. Speaker, to have a serious debate about gun violence and to pass legislation that will deprive people the right to own a high-capacity assault weapon and high-caliber bullets and use them to kill innocent people. Now is the time. 136 mass shootings have taken place during the first 164 days of this year. It is a sad statistic that we must address. The United States is 5 percent of the world's population, yet we are 31 percent of the mass shootings in the world. It is time to act. Let me talk about the topic tonight, very briefly. The Congressional Black Caucus has been committed to advancing access to affordable health care for all Americans so that we can eliminate racially based health disparities. That has been our mission for many years. Eliminating health disparities means addressing inequities in environmental, social, and economic conditions in all of our communities. By all measurable statistics, from health outcomes to participation in health professions, African Americans lag so far behind. For example, more than 40 percent of African Americans have high blood pressure--a rate that is one of the highest in the world. African Americans are more likely to develop hypertension at a younger age and are at higher risk of stroke, heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and death from heart disease. Stroke, Mr. Speaker, is the third leading cause of death in the United States. African Americans are 50 percent more likely to experience a stroke than White Americans. That is a fact. According to the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, African American children are twice as likely to have asthma as White children, and Black children are 10 times more likely than White children to die of complications from asthma. African Americans were, on average, 6 years younger than Whites when they suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest incidence among African American men was 175 per 100,000; whereas, the incidence for White males was just 84 per 100,000. Cardiac arrest in African American women was 90 per 100,000, as opposed to 40 per 100,000 for Caucasian women. Another illness which disparately impacts the African American community is that of prostate cancer. In June of last year, I introduced the National Prostate Cancer Plan Act, a bipartisan bill which seeks to establish the National Prostate Cancer Council on Screening, Early Detection and Assessment and Monitoring of Prostate Cancer. Prostate cancer impacts one in seven American men and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the U.S., with nearly 30,000 deaths anticipated just this year. African American men are particularly vulnerable, as they are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 2.5 times more likely to die from the disease than their White counterparts. Just last week, House Republicans released their A Better Way agenda to address poverty, but that proposal, like others they have released, will not lift Americans out of poverty. In some cases, these types of proposals can actually push low-income Americans even deeper into poverty, further limiting their access to health care and exacerbating health disparities. So, Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to continue our efforts to address the health disparities and barriers. That is what the Congressional Black Caucus is advocating the evening. We are going to continue this work until every disparity is removed. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank Congressman Butterfield for making us aware of 136 mass shootings in 164 days of this year. Certainly, that is relevant to tonight's topic, because whether it is death by guns or death by healthcare disparities, there are too many deaths. I think you said it so well when you provided the data and the statistics of African American men and their mortality rates and what is happening to them. And yes, African Americans lag behind, and that is why we stand with you bridging the gap and for this call of action. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) from the Second Congressional District, my colleague, my confidant, and my friend. She is a champion of expanding health care. She is a champion, Mr. Speaker, of making sure that we understand that healthcare disparities must end. She is the chair of the powerful and most prestigious Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust. She strives to increase healthcare opportunities for all: for our children, for our senior citizens, and for residents of the underserved communities. It is my honor to ask her to provide some information on today's topic. {time} 2000 Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues and my classmates, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), my friend, and the distinguished gentleman from New [[Page H3739]] York (Mr. Jeffries), for leading this important conversation about bridging the divide to eliminate racial health disparities. But I can't weigh in on that topic until I first address the horrific events of yesterday in Orlando, Florida. Our Nation is horrified and heartbroken by the tragedy in Orlando. We are disgusted by this brutal attack. We will not tolerate terrorism or hate in any form against any group of people because this is just not our way. These ideas of hate will not endure because there is not strength to them. We will win the battle against terrorism and intolerance. We will hold leaders accountable who put their NRA score ahead of the need to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists. We will stand with the LGBTQ community and value their lives, their health, and their security from the threat of violence and hate. And we will work to see that all Americans enjoy the very same freedoms and protections. We have done a lot of moments of silence, but I believe in showing respect through action, not silence, and that is why we are here this evening to discuss what divides us as a country in a health sense. For 45 years, the Congressional Black Caucus has been out front in Congress in fighting for these freedoms and protections. And when it comes to the matter of health equity, I have worked to champion the health policy concerns of vulnerable communities as my predecessors in the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, the Honorable Louis Stokes and Dr. Christensen, have done. Some of my colleagues here know this, but I want to repeat it for anyone who doesn't. Before he was killed, Martin Luther King, Jr., was quoted as saying: ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' I couldn't agree more, and as the chair of the Health Braintrust, I have worked with many of the people in this room to focus on advancing this critical phase of the human rights and civil rights struggle: health equity. When Benjamin Franklin created the Nation's first public hospital, The Pennsylvania Hospital, he did so in order to establish the promotion of public health as a core American value. He did so to care for our Nation's diseased and sick poor. Nearly 300 years later, the Affordable Care Act cemented health care as a fundamental right for all Americans. Yet, today, we find ourselves at a crossroads in health care. Health disparities in communities of color continue to be intractable hurdles in the quest to achieve health equity in America. African Americans are infected with HIV at a rate that is 8 times that of White Americans. While White women are more likely to have breast cancer, African American women are 40 percent more likely to die from the disease. African Americans, Latinos, Asians, and Pacific Islanders, as well as Native Americans, are diagnosed with lupus two to three times more frequently than Caucasians. More than 13 percent of African Americans aged 20 or older have diagnosed diabetes. And people of color are two to four times more likely than Whites to reach end-stage renal disease. This grim snapshot illustrates that, despite the gains we have made since the days of Ben Franklin and the ACA, there is still much ground to cover in closing the health equity gap. Last year, I drafted a comprehensive report, The Kelly Report on Health Disparities, an official Congressional analysis of the state of minority health in the U.S. that offers a blueprint for reversing negative health trends in communities of color. The Kelly Report brought Members of Congress together, medical professionals, and public health thought leaders to examine the root causes and impact of health disparities in America, and provide a comprehensive set of legislative and policy recommendations to address them. The whole can only ever be as healthy as its parts. For America to achieve true health equity, lawmakers, community leaders, and industry stakeholders must come together and aggressively work to reduce disparities nationwide. We all have a part to play in creating a healthier America. We must take heed of Dr. King's words: ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' And we can and we must fix that. Again, because of what happened in Orlando, and I want to say it is the mass shooting that we are talking about, and it is tragic, but the night before, one person was shot. And I often liken this to a 747 crash as we talk about that, but we don't talk about the two-seater. And that two-seater, the person that died alone in that club after she sung Friday night has a brother, a mother, a father, and their pain is just as harsh. So let's not forget that young lady that lost her life. And she did not lose her life to someone that was Muslim or someone that believed in ISIS. She lost her life to an American young man, a Caucasian. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois, (Ms. Kelly). And how appropriate for tonight for the gentlewoman to remind us, as I ask her to constantly do, about why we must, to put it in her words, come together. We must do something. Madam Speaker, tonight we say to you and to our Republican colleagues: Come together and do something. I say to the gentlewoman, Congresswoman Kelly: Let today serve as a turning point in our Nation's ongoing struggle to stamp out hate of all forms. We must mourn those who lost their family members, but we must do more than mourn. We must have action. If we are going to have a hope for a better America, hate has no place in this great Nation. So I thank the gentlewoman, and I will continue to remind others that we know firsthand what it does to our community. But, Madam Speaker, we stand here tonight speaking to all communities. But here is what we know. The NAACP has shared with us that African American children and teens accounted for 45 percent of all child and teen gun deaths in 2008 and 2009, but were only 15 percent of the total child population. The FBI says that approximately 47 percent of victims of the 165,000 homicides from 2000 to 2010, including over 111,000 gun-related homicides, were Black. The Children's Defense Fund, Madam Speaker, says that in 2010, Black males between the ages of 15 and 19 were nearly 30 times more likely to die in a gun homicide than White males of the same age, and more than three times more likely to die in a gun homicide than Hispanic males of the same age. So, Madam Speaker, tonight you will hear us repeatedly make a call for action. You will hear us repeatedly quote great leaders. And I think it is worth quoting again what Congresswoman Kelly said, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King: ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane'' of all inequalities, of all injustices. As we speak of great leaders, it is, indeed, my honor and my privilege to ask my colleague, the gentleman from the 10th Congressional District of New Jersey (Mr. Payne), a man who has made a name for himself, a man who understands firsthand as a father of triplets, as a spouse, as a ranking member on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, a man who has been at the forefront in his community, a man who served before coming here as an elected official, but, more importantly, a person who understands health disparities and the call for action--it gives me great honor to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) to share some wisdom with us tonight. Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I first want to start by thanking Congresswoman Beatty for that very kind and generous introduction. We, in our class, are very proud of our colleagues, and we support each other in times of need. I just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, the gentleman from New York, who is also host of this Special Order. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me. Before I begin, I just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible [[Page H3740]] tragedy in Orlando, and I can only imagine what they are going through. The other thing that is illuminating to me is that, as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence, after that moment of silence, I believe Members were given a 1-minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor, as is customary, and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in Orlando. So not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this House, but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle. Madam Speaker, eliminating racial-based health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all. Even in the 21st century, health disparities are stark, especially in the African American communities, where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among Whites. Today, despite improvement in overall health in the United States, African Americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas, including access to quality care, timelines of care, and health outcomes. For years, the Congressional Black Caucus has called on Republicans to join us and other House Democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities, a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities, such as inequities in environmental, social, and economic conditions in our communities. Instead, we get from them proposals like their so-called A Better Way poverty proposal, a stale, repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about Americans trapped in poverty. Cutting job training programs, food assistance, and Head Start will push low-income Americans further into poverty, making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their well-being and the well-being of their families. We need to, instead, use the government as a source of good. Every American deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment. Yet, low-income and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution, resulting in serious health problems such as asthma, heart problems, and cancer. This is a very real problem across America, a very real problem in my district. Thirteen million people, including 3.5 million children, are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution. {time} 2015 My district is home to the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, part of the Port of New York and New Jersey, the third largest port in the country. According to the EPA, 25 percent of children in Newark suffer from asthma--three times the State average. What we need are additional Federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system. The issue is critical to the low-income and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards. Now, since I am on the topic of environmental justice, I just want to remind everyone that the Republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in Flint, including a vote to block the Families of Flint Act emergency supplemental. Their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for American families, and, I think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities. The way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable. It is to address the environmental, social, and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities. It is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes. It is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations. In closing, Madam Speaker, I also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racial-based health disparities. African Americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor provider-patient communication and health literacy issues. Consequently, they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions. We have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find, understand, and use the information and services. As co-chair of the Congressional Men's Health Caucus, I have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and well-being. So I encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions, to get the security you and your family deserve, and to get the health care that we all need. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank Congressman Payne so much for giving us such compelling information and data and reminding us that the time is now for us to enact those programs that work, and the time is now for us to understand what is at risk. Also, let me thank the gentleman for his role on the Congressional Men's Health Caucus. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from the State of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The gentlewoman from the 18th Congressional District of Texas is someone who I am always amazed when she comes to the mic, someone who is well researched, and someone who delivers an oratorical message that makes us take pause and pay attention. Tonight, I would like to say that Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is a movement. Earlier, I heard her use that word in talk about how we, Madam Speaker, must be the movement against violence, that we must be leading that movement against these disparities in health care. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, there is no doubt how much I appreciate the Congressional Black Caucus and Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman Jeffries for always being timely in allowing us to give a message to our colleagues. We hope maybe the American people will hear us, but we accept that this body is the body to which and to whom we speak. So I am thankful for that. I want to pay tribute, overall, to the Congressional Black Caucus because we are actually here speaking of health disparities, because it was the caucus that triggered this debate through the years that we have been trying to get universal access to health care and was the moving force in the 2009, 2008, and 2010 passage, ultimately, of the Affordable Care Act, where the work that we did, joining Congresswoman Donna Christian-Christiansen, at that time, and Frank Pallone on the Congressional Health Caucus, but on the CBC we had the health disparities task to ensure that the language in the Affordable Care Act addressed the issue of health disparities. There was a large section on that that built on some of the work that some of us had already done creating the Office of Minority Health that I had worked on in years past. So it was the lightning bolt of the caucus, and then working with the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and then the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that we raised the issue that no one was talking about. I remember debating on the floor of the House on the issues of dealing with senior citizen African American men and how they access health care, how do women access health care, and how do women impacted by diabetes access health care. These are some of the diseases that have a proclivity to the African American population. We were finding out that we even had an issue where medical professionals didn't know how to ask the questions. How do you address someone who needs to be diagnosed for prostate cancer or may be diagnosed for prostate cancer and is an African American male, a senior citizen? My father ultimately died from cancer that metastasized from the prostate to the lungs and the brain, so we knew we had a serious issue. [[Page H3741]] So today, I want to mention four points, but I am going to focus on the last one, obesity--a question of access to health care and physical fitness. Many times we live in areas where there is no access to a pool or a tennis court. Mental health--if you lived your life in a segregated America, if you were called ``Boy'' and ``Girl,'' it is a different mental health situation than maybe others may have faced. If you live in a situation of poverty, of a single household, maybe--this is not across the board--these issues will be impacted. If you lived around gun violence, if you saw your 15-year-old friend being shot dead in the street, there is a question of mental health that we need access to that care for us to be able to reach out or maybe counselors to be able to provide for children. HIV/AIDS is something that we have lived through. I remember going to funerals of friends in the 1980s and into the 1990s, particularly with HIV/AIDS. So we have worked in the Congressional Black Caucus to massively talk about testing. Let me get to this point that I want to dwell just for a moment on, and that is gun violence. I was here on the floor earlier with my head held down and my heart heavy as my district, today, had a memorial. They had one yesterday. We will have one tomorrow and have one on Wednesday. I mourn with Congresswoman Corinne Brown of Florida. We are offering legislation dealing with the assault weapons and to complement legislation already passed or already in place. But it is important to note that this is a health issue, because the Centers for Disease Control can assess and study every health issue that faces America today, but they are legislatively, by law, prohibited by my friends on other side of the aisle, by Republicans, disallowed every year to give them permission to study gun violence. Gun violence is killing our children and killing our families. In Orlando, it killed Latinos who happened to be the attendees at the Pulse Club. The LGBTQ community was the dominant community, and a hateful terroristic act using AR-15s and Glock guns killed them. The incident was the deadliest mass shooting. The next deadliest incidents in recent history were April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech, 32 killed, 17 injured; December 14, 2012, Sandy Hook, 26 killed, 1 injured; October 16, 1991, Killeen, Texas, 23 killed, 27 injured. According to Everytown index of mass shootings where four or more people are shot and killed, the incident was the ninth mass shooting in the United States in 2016, and the 150th mass shooting in United States since January 1, 2009. The mass shooting with guns impacts both the mental health, the sanctity, and the minority community. It is shameful that we are not allowed to engage in the kind of research that a Harvard professor talked about, and that is the assessing of violence and the assessing of violence with guns. The materials I have before me make it very clear that most of these violent acts are done with guns--done with guns. San Bernardino, Chattanooga, Charleston, Garland, Oak Creek, and Fort Hood were all done with guns. So I stand here today to challenge this issue of health disparities to say that the heavy brunt of killings, singular killings, are impacted by poverty, lack of access to health care, the proliferation of guns in our inner city communities, and the failure of the United States Congress to put real gun safety legislation, closing the loophole, the Jim Clyburn rule that says that, if you don't get the review and approval by ATF, you do not get the gun. You have to wait until you get the approval from ATF, which may be trying to determine whether this person with multiple problems, mental health or background issues, doesn't need to get a gun and then ultimately go kill their spouse, their children, their neighbors, their family members or strangers. So it is my belief today that this health disparities debate is crucial, and we should come away from here recognizing that obesity, the issues of mental health and HIV/AIDS can be, with great investment, researched for cures, or cancer that proliferates in our community, triple negative breast cancer, legislation that I have put forward and have gotten passed about that impact. But it is the gun violence that we are doing absolutely nothing about. The disparities and the impact on minority communities is atrocious. I want to close simply by saying the word or the acronym LGBTQ community. I want to say it over and over again, because I think it is shameful that, in our debate, in our recognition of the tragedy of Orlando, that we don't acknowledge the horrific hate crime and the hatefulness against that community. As I stand here, that community is diverse, and there are African Americans who are LGBTQ. So I would ask that, as we move forward this week, we will be reminded of this hatefulness and we will have a cure. We will be reminded of this violence, and we will have a cure. That cure, first of all, will be to restrain the use of assault weapons and these weapons of war-type bullets that men and women in the United States military say have no business on the streets of America. I believe, Congresswoman, that health disparities are an important wall and division to overcome. I thank the gentlewoman for having this Special Order to ensure that we will confront these issues and try to save lives. Racial disparities refer to the variation in rates of disease occurrence and disabilities between socioeconomic and/or geographically defined population groups. I want to focus on four areas of racial disparities in health that impact African Americans that we can do something about: 1. Obesity; 2. Mental Health; 3. HIV/AIDS; and 4. Gun Violence. African Americans, based on 2015 Census data, comprise 13.2 percent of the U.S. population, or about 42 million people. Socioeconomic status, in turn, is linked to mental health: People who are impoverished, homeless, incarcerated or have substance abuse problems are at higher risk for poor mental health. As the founder and chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I am especially concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic among African-American youth. More than 40 percent of African American teenagers are overweight, and nearly 25 percent are obese. The percentage of children aged 6-11 years in the United States who were obese increased from 7 percent in 1980 to nearly 18 percent in 2012. African American youth are consuming less nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables and are not getting enough physical exercise. This combination has led to an epidemic of obesity, which directly contributes to numerous deadly or life-threatening diseases or conditions, including the following: Hypertension; Dyslipidemia (High Cholesterol or High Triglyceride Levels); Type 2 Diabetes; Coronary Heart Disease; Stroke; Gallbladder Disease; Osteoarthritis; Asthma, bronchitis, sleep apnea, and other respiratory problems; Cancer (Breast, Colon, and Endometrial). When ethnicity and income are considered, the picture is even more troubling. African American youngsters from low-income families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higher-income families. Efforts such as the Let's Move! Campaign by the First Lady are pivotal to ensuring that communities are able to provide healthy snacks and food and encourage healthier decisions. Since the mid-1970s, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children. Non-Hispanic blacks have the highest age-adjusted rates of obesity at 47.8 percent. According to the CDC, 37.6 percent of men and 56.9 percent of women twenty years and over are obese. Every year, more than 40 million Americans struggle with mental illness. African American men are as likely as anyone else to have mental illness, but they are less likely to get help. Racism continues to have an impact on the mental health of African Americans. Negative stereotypes and attitudes of rejection have decreased, but continue to occur with measurable, adverse consequences. Historical and contemporary instances of negative treatment have led to a mistrust of authorities, many of whom are not seen as having the best interests of African Americans in mind. According to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health: Adult blacks are 20 percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than adult whites. Adult blacks living below poverty are two to three times more likely to report serious psychological distress than those living above poverty. Adult blacks are more likely to have feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness than are adult whites. How African Americans view mental health over generations is a major barrier to accessing mental health services and treatment. [[Page H3742]] In 1996, MHA commissioned a national survey on clinical depression. The survey explored the barriers preventing Americans seeking treatment and gauged overall knowledge of and attitudes toward depression. This survey revealed that: 63 percent of African Americans believe that depression is a personal weakness. This is significantly higher than the overall survey average of 54 percent. Only 31 percent of African Americans believed that depression was a ``health problem.'' African Americans were more likely to believe that depression was ``normal'' than the overall survey average. 56 percent believed that depression was a normal part of aging. 45 percent believed it was normal for a mother to feel depressed for at least two weeks after giving birth. 40 percent believed it was normal for a husband or wife to feel depressed for more than a year after the death of a spouse. Many of these problems persist to this day. As Doctor William Lawson of Howard University (and MHA's District of Columbia affiliate) pointed out in an NPR interview in 2012, ``Many African-Americans have a lot of negative feelings about, or not even aware of mental health services. The ``Mental Health: Culture, Race and Ethnicity Supplement'' to the 1999 U.S. Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health, states the following: African-American physicians are five times more likely than white physicians to treat African-American patients. African-American patients who see African-American physicians rate their physicians' styles of interaction as more participatory. African Americans seeking help for a mental health problem would have trouble finding African American mental health professionals: In 1998, only 2 percent of psychiatrists, 2 percent of psychologists and 4 percent of social workers said they were African Americans. The public mental health safety net of hospitals, community health centers, and local health departments are vital to many African Americans, especially to those in high-need populations. African Americans of all ages are underrepresented in outpatient treatment but over-represented in inpatient treatment. Few African-American children receive treatment in privately funded psychiatric hospitals, but many receive treatment in publicly funded residential treatment centers for emotionally disturbed youth. In 2012, there were an estimated 356,268 inmates with severe mental illnesses in U.S. prisons and jails. There were only 35,000 mentally ill individuals in state psychiatric hospitals. The report, ``The Treatment of Persons With Mental Illness in Prisons and Jails,'' jails ``in 44 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, a prison or jail in that state holds more individuals with serious mental illness than the largest remaining state psychiatric hospital.'' the report said. African Americans today are overrepresented in our jails and prisons. People of color account for 60 percent of the prison population. The Stanford Law School Three Strikes Project's report stated that, ``over the past 15 years, the number of mentally ill people in prison in California has almost doubled.'' In California, 45 percent of state prison inmates have been treated for severe mental illness within the past year. African Americans also account for 14 percent of regular drug users, but for 37 percent of drug arrests. Illicit drug use is frequently associated with self-medication among people with mental illnesses. In January 2014, the Texas Observer reported that, of the 9,000 inmates in Harris County Jail more than 25 percent take medication for mental illness, which means that the jail treats more psychiatric patients than all 10 of Texas' state-run public mental hospitals combined. The passage of the Affordable Care Act created access to health care for those who purchase health insurance and for the poor living in states that are participating in the Medicaid component of the ACA. Disparities can occur, if physicians do not refer patients with signs of mental illness for proper treatment or if referred patients do not seek out treatment. Disparities in access to care and treatment for mental illnesses have also persisted over time. As noted by the Office of Minority Health: Only 8.7 percent of adult blacks, versus 16 percent of adult whites, received treatment for mental health concerns in 2007-2008. Only 6.2 percent of adult blacks, versus 13.9 percent of adult whites, received medications for mental health concerns during 2008. While 68.7 percent of adult whites with a major depressive episode in 2009 received treatment, only 53.2 percent of adult blacks did. The Affordable Care Act will have an impact on this gap by 2016. Depression and other mental illness can be deadly if left untreated. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among African Americans 15 to 24 years old. Untreated mental illness can also make African American men more vulnerable to substance abuse, homelessness, incarceration, and homicide. African Americas are the racial/ethnic group most affected by HIV in the United States. According to the CDC, 44 percent (19,540) of estimated new HIV Diagnoses in the United States were among African Americans, who comprise 12 percent of the US population. HIV/AIDs are now the leading cause of death among African Americans ages 25 to 44--ahead of heart disease, accidents, cancer, and homicide. At the end of 2012, an estimated 496,500 African Americans were living with HIV, representing 41 percent of all Americans living with the Virus. Of African Americans living with HIV, around 14 percent do not know they are infected. African Americans accounted for an estimated 44 percent of all new HIV infections among adults and adolescents (aged 13 years or older) in 2010, despite representing only 12 percent of the U.S. population. HIV is a sexually transmitted disease or STD; it is also spread through intravenous drug use. HIV infections spread through sharing of needles has declined with needle programs, while the STD rates of infection among African Americans has increased at rate higher than any other ethnic group. Have their HIV status checked--not once but annually. Know the HIV status of sexual partner. If HIV positive: Know how to get on antiviral medication, 2 small pills taken each day, and stay on them. Where to go for information if you or your partner is HIV positive. In 2010, men accounted for 70 percent (14,700) of the estimated 20,900 new HIV infections among all adult and adolescent African Americans. The estimated rate of new HIV infections for African American men (103.6/100,000 population) was 7 times that of white men, twice that of Latino men, and nearly 3 times that of African American women. In 2010, African American gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men represented an estimated 72 percent (10,600) of new infections among all African American men and 36 percent of an estimated 29,800 new HIV infections among all gay and bisexual men. Of those gay and bisexual men, 39 percent (4,321) were young men aged 13 to 24. According to the CDC, the numbers of new HIV diagnoses among African American women fell 42 percent between 2005 to 2014, but it is still high compared to women of other races/ethnicities. Most new HIV infections among African American women (87 percent; 5,300) are attributed to heterosexual contact. In 2012, there were 72,010 Texans living with HIV/AIDS. Texas has the 10th highest number of HIV diagnoses in 2013 and ranks 18th for deaths from HIV. Currently 14 percent of the people living with HIV are undiagnosed and only 30 percent of the people with HIV are virally suppressed, which means that 70 percent of the people who are ill are not on medication that can help limit their ability to infect others. HIV is an unnecessarily disproportionate burden on the African American and Latino community. There is a wall of misinformation about the illness and an uncomfortable silence regarding the need to speak about the illness not only to the young, but also the older persons. When treatments were first developed in the 1990s they had lots of side effects that made patients very ill. Few talk about the advances in HIV treatment that now involve taking 2 small pills a day with the result leaving patients feeling healthy and able to engage in life's normal activities. The virus count for those who take their medication is so low that it often does not register in tests. This does not mean that people are cured, but it does mean that there is no reason not to get tested so that you know if you are in need of treatment. Anyone can become infected--so it is up to all of us to educate our families, neighbors, co-workers and friends about getting tested. There are some insurance company practices that have a detrimental impact on the ability of people with HIV to enroll in qualified health insurance plans. In states like Texas that are not fully participating in the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid [[Page H3743]] expansion this is especially problematic for HIV patients who are poor. Some states allow insurance carriers to post misleading or intentionally vague formularies on market place websites or excluding essential HIV medications from drug formularies and impressing high cost sharing. Out of pocket medication cost each month should be capped. Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for reminding us that we should be done with guns like the assault weapons. I thank the gentlewoman for reminding us of the impact that health disparities have on our communities in this Nation. {time} 2030 Madam Speaker, I have two documents that will be entered into the Record. The first document is from Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson. I would like to state for the Record that she was the first nurse to serve in this United States Congress. And the second is a portion of the Special Feature on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities: 30 Years After the Heckler Report. Special Feature on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities: 30 Years After the Heckler Report Introduction The 1985 Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health, released by then Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler, documented significant disparities in the burden of illness and mortality experienced by blacks and other minority groups in the U.S. population compared with whites (41). The report laid out an ambitious agenda, including improving minority access to high-quality health care, expanding health promotion and health education outreach activities, increasing the number of minority health care providers, and enhancing federal and state data collection activities to better report on minority health issues. In the 30 years since the Heckler Report, national efforts to improve minority health through outreach, programming, and monitoring have included the formation of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Minority Health in 1986 (42); the annual National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports first issued in 2003 (43); the adoption of disparities elimination as an overarching goal of Healthy People 2010 (44); and most recently, an HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities--a comprehensive federal commitment to reduce and eventually eliminate disparities in health and health care (45). Race is a social construct influenced by a complex set of factors (46,47). Because of the complexity and difficulty in conceptualizing and defining race, as well as the increasing representation of racial and ethnic subgroups in the United States, racial classification and data collection systems continue to evolve and expand. In 1977, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) required that all federal data collection efforts collect data on a minimum of four race groups (American Indian or Alaskan Native, black, Asian or Pacific Islander, and white) and did not allow the reporting of more than one race (48). In 1997, in response to growing interest in more detailed reporting on race and ethnicity, OMB mandated data collection for a minimum of five race groups, splitting Asian or Pacific Islander into two categories (Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) (49). In addition, the 1997 standards allowed respondents to report more than one race. A minimum of two categories for data collection on ethnicity, ``Hispanic or Latino'' and ``Not Hispanic or Latino,'' were also required under the 1997 OMB standards. Consequently, whereas the Heckler Report primarily documented black-white differences in health and mortality due to data limitations, this Special Feature is able to report on more detailed racial and ethnic groups. For example, Figures 19-21 display trends in infant mortality and low-risk cesarean section deliveries, and the current data on preterm births for five Hispanic-origin groups. At the time of the Heckler Report, 22.3% of the population were considered racial or ethnic minorities (Table 1). Current Census (2014) estimates identify 37.9% of the population as racial or ethnic minorities (50). In 2014, Hispanic persons, who may be of any race, comprised 17.4% of the U.S. population. Non-Hispanic multiple race persons were 2.0% of the population. For the single race groups, non- Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons were 0.7%, non-Hispanic Asian persons were 5.3%, non-Hispanic black persons were 12.4%, non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander persons were 0.2%, and non-Hispanic white persons were 62.1% of the U.S. population in 2014 (50). Understanding the demographic and socioeconomic composition of U.S. racial and ethnic groups is important because these characteristics are associated with health risk factors, disease prevalence, and access to care, which in turn drive health care utilization and expenditures. Non-Hispanic white persons are, on average, older than those in other racial and ethnic groups, with a median age of 43.1 years, and Hispanic individuals are the youngest, with a median age of 28.5 years in 2014 (50). About one-quarter of black only persons (26.2%) and Hispanic persons (23.6%) lived in poverty compared with 10.1% of non-Hispanic white only persons and 12.0% of Asian only persons in 2014 (51). Non-Hispanic black only children and Hispanic children were particularly likely to live in poverty (37.3% and 31.9%, respectively, in 2014) (52). However, Hispanic individuals are often found to have quite favorable health and mortality patterns in comparison with non-Hispanic white persons and particularly with non-Hispanic black persons, despite having a disadvantaged socioeconomic profile--a pattern termed the epidemiologic paradox (53). HHS defines a racial or ethnic health disparity as ``a particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage. Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group'' (54). There are many different ways to measure racial and ethnic differences in health and mortality, which can lead to different conclusions (55-58). This Special Feature on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (Special Feature) uses the maximal rate difference, one of three overall measures used in Healthy People 2020 to measure differences among groups of people (see Technical Notes). The maximal rate difference is an overall measure of health disparities calculated as the absolute difference between the highest and lowest group rates in the population for a given characteristic (59). The identification of groups that experience the highest and lowest rates in this Special Feature was based on observed rates and was not tested for a statistically significant difference against other rates. Ties in highest or lowest rates were resolved by examining decimal places. With respect to changes in health disparities over time, tracking the maximal rate difference over time enables one to determine whether the absolute difference between the highest and lowest group rates is increasing, decreasing, or stable. The Special Feature charts that follow provide detailed comparisons of key measures of mortality, natality, health conditions, health behaviors, and health care access and utilization, by race, race and ethnicity, or by detailed Hispanic origin, depending on data availability. A majority of the 10 graphs in this year's Special Feature present trends in health from 1999-2014. Results indicate that trends in health were generally positive for the overall population and several graphs illustrate success in narrowing gaps in health by racial and ethnic group. Differences in life expectancy, infant mortality, cigarette smoking among women, influenza vaccinations among those aged 65 and over, and health insurance coverage narrowed among the racial and ethnic groups. For example, the absolute difference in infant mortality rates between infants born to non-Hispanic black mothers (highest rate) and infants born to non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander mothers (lowest rate) narrowed between 1999-2014. Differences by racial and ethnic group in the prevalence of high blood pressure and smoking among adult men remained stable throughout the study period, with non- Hispanic black adults more likely to have high blood pressure than adults in other racial and ethnic groups throughout the period, and non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white males more likely to be current smokers than Hispanic and non- Hispanic Asian men. For low-risk cesarean sections, influenza vaccinations among adults aged 18-64, and unmet dental care needs, the gap widened among the racial and ethnic groups between 1999-2014. Despite improvements over time in many of the health measures presented in this Special Feature, disparities by race and ethnicity were found in the most recent year for all 10 measures, indicating that although progress has been made in the 30 years since the Heckler Report, elimination of disparities in health and access to health care has yet to be achieved. Life Expectancy at Birth In 2014, life expectancy was longer for Hispanic men and women than for non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black men and women. Life expectancy is a measure often used to gauge the overall health of a population. Life expectancy at birth represents the average number of years that a group of infants would live if the group were to experience the age- specific death rates present in the year of birth. Differences in life expectancy among various demographic subpopulations, including racial and ethnic groups, may reflect subpopulation differences in a range of factors such as socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and the prevalence of specific risk factors in a particular subpopulation (60,61). During 1980-2014, life expectancy at birth in the United States increased from 70.0 to 76.4 years for males and from 77.4 to 81.2 years for females (Table 15, and data table for Figure 18). During this period, life expectancy at birth for males and females was longest for white persons and shortest for black persons. For both males and females, racial differences in life expectancy at birth narrowed, but persisted during 1980-2014. Life expectancy at birth was 6.9 years longer for white males than for black males in 1980, and this difference narrowed to 4.2 years in 2014. [[Page H3744]] In 1980, life expectancy at birth was 5.6 years longer for white females than for black females, and this difference narrowed to 3.0 years in 2014. In 2014, Hispanic males and females had the longest life expectancy at birth, and non-Hispanic black males and females had the shortest. In 2014, life expectancy at birth was 7.2 years longer for Hispanic males than for non-Hispanic black males and 5.9 years longer for Hispanic females than for non- Hispanic black females. Infant Mortality During 1999-2013, infant mortality rates were highest among infants born to non-Hispanic black women (11.11 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2013). Infant mortality, the death of a baby before his or her first birthday, is an important indicator of the health and wellbeing of a country. It not only measures the risk of infant death but it is used as an indicator of maternal health, community health status, and availability of quality health services and medical technology (62,63). The infant mortality rate in the United States decreased from 7.04 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999 to 6.75 in 2007, and then decreased at a faster rate to 5.96 in 2013. Trends in infant mortality rates during 1999-2013 varied among the five racial and ethnic groups. During 1999-2013, infants born to non-Hispanic black mothers experienced the highest rates of infant mortality (11.11 in 2013) and infants born to non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander mothers experienced the lowest rates (3.90 in 2013). The difference between the highest and lowest infant mortality rates among the five racial and ethnic groups was stable from 1999 to 2006 and then narrowed from 2006 to 2013. The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (non- Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander) infant mortality rates was 9.41 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999, compared with 7.21 in 2013. For infants born to Hispanic mothers, the infant mortality rate remained stable during 1999-2008 (5.71 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999) and then decreased to 5.00 in 2013. During 1999-2013, the infant mortality rate for Hispanic infants varied by the mother's Hispanic-origin group. Throughout this period, infants born to Puerto Rican mothers experienced the highest mortality rates. In all years except 2009, infants born to Cuban mothers and those born to Central and South American mothers experienced the lowest mortality rates at alternate times throughout 1999-2013. The difference between the highest (Puerto Rican) and lowest (Cuban) infant mortality rates among Hispanic-origin groups narrowed from 3.71 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999 to 2.88 in 2013. During 1999-2013, the difference in infant mortality rates was narrower for mothers in the Hispanic- origin groups than for mothers in the five racial and ethnic groups. Preterm Births In 2014, non-Hispanic black mothers had the highest percentage of preterm births of the five racial and ethnic groups, and Puerto Rican mothers had the highest percentage of preterm births of the five Hispanic-origin groups. An infant's gestational age is an important predictor of his or her survival and subsequent health (64-70). Preterm birth prior to 37 weeks gestation affects infant mortality rates and racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality (Figure 19) (71). The degree of prematurity matters--infants born prior to 32 weeks gestation are at greatest risk of death during infancy, with the risk of infant death decreasing as gestational age increases (72). In 2014, 7.7% of singleton births occurred before 37 weeks of gestation; 5.7% at 34-36 weeks; 0.8% at 32-33 weeks gestation; and 1.2% before 32 weeks (data table for Figure 20). In 2014, among the five racial and ethnic groups, non- Hispanic black women had the highest percentage of singleton births before 37 weeks (11.1%) and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander women had the lowest percentage (6.8%). Non- Hispanic black women also had the highest percentage of singleton preterm births at each preterm gestational age. The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander) percentages of singleton preterm births among the five racial and ethnic groups was 4.3 percentage points (before 37 weeks), 2.0 percentage points (34-36 weeks), 0.6 percentage points (32-33 weeks), and 1.7 percentage points (before 32 weeks). Among Hispanic-origin groups in 2014, Puerto Rican mothers had the highest percentage of singleton births before 37 weeks (9.1%) and Cuban mothers had the lowest percentage (7.2%). The difference between the highest (Puerto Rican) and lowest (Cuban) percentages of singleton preterm births among the Hispanic-origin groups was 1.9 percentage points (before 37 weeks) and 1.3 percentage points (34-36 weeks). Central and South American mothers had the lowest percentage of singleton births before 34 weeks. For preterm births before 34 weeks, the difference between the highest (Puerto Rican) and lowest (Central and South American) percentages was 0.2 percentage points (32-33 weeks) and 0.6 percentage points (before 32 weeks). Low-risk Births Delivered by Cesarean Section During 1999-2014 non-Hispanic black mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries among the five racial and ethnic groups (29.9% in 2014); Cuban mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries among the five Hispanic-origin groups (41.49-6 in 2014). Cesarean deliveries comprise approximately one-third of all births in the United States (32.2% in 2014) and can place mothers and infants at increased risk for poor health outcomes (74). Over the past decade, professional medical groups have attempted to reduce low-risk cesarean deliveries defined as cesarean deliveries among full term (37 or more completed weeks of gestation), singleton, vertex (head first) births to women giving birth for the first time (75,76). The percentage of low-risk births that were delivered by cesarean section increased from 19.5% to 26.6% during 1999- 2005, stabilized during 2005-2009, and then decreased to 26.0% in 2014 (data table for Figure 21). Throughout the period 1999-2014, non-Hispanic black mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries (29.9% in 2014) among the five racial and ethnic groups, while non- Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native mothers experienced the lowest percentage (21.5% in 2014). The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native) percentages widened from 4.8 percentage points in 1999 to 8.4 percentage points in 2014. Among Hispanic mothers, the percentage of low-risk births that were delivered by cesarean section increased from 18.7% to 24.6% during 1999-2004, increased at a slower rate from 2004-2009, and then remained stable during 2009-2014 (data table for Figure 21). Throughout the period 1999-2014 Cuban mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries (41.4% in 2014), while Mexican mothers experienced the lowest percentage (24.1% in 2014). Among Hispanic-origin groups, the difference between the highest and lowest percentages of low-risk cesarean deliveries was stable during 1999-2002, widened sharply during 2002-2006, and then narrowed during 2006-2014. The difference between the highest (Cuban) and lowest (Mexican) percentages was 11.7 percentage points in 1999, 21.5 percentage points in 2006, and 17.3 percentage points in 2014. Children and Adolescents With Obesity In 2011-2014 for children and adolescents aged 2-19 years, Hispanic children and adolescents had the highest prevalence of obesity and non-Hispanic Asian children had the lowest prevalence. Childhood obesity is a serious public health challenge in the United States and many other industrialized nations in the world (Figure 8) (19,77,78). Excess body weight in children is associated with excess morbidity in childhood and excess body weight in adulthood (13,14). Obesity among children and adolescents is defined as a body mass index at or above the sex- and age-specific 95th percentile of the CDC growth charts (15). Between 1999-2000 and 2013-2014, the percentage of children and adolescents aged 2-19 with obesity increased from 13.9% to 17.2% (79). However, among youth aged 2-19, the prevalence of obesity did not change from 2003-2004 through 2013-2014 (79). In 2011-2014 for children and adolescents aged 2-19, the percentage with obesity was highest for Hispanic children and adolescents and lowest for non-Hispanic Asian children and adolescents. For those aged 2-19, the difference between the highest (Hispanic) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) percentages was 13.3 percentage points. For children aged 2-5, the percentage with obesity was highest for Hispanic children and lowest for non-Hispanic white children. (The estimate for non-Hispanic Asian children aged 2-5 was not stable and is not shown.) The difference between the highest (Hispanic) and lowest (non-Hispanic white) percentages was 10.4 percentage points for children aged 2-5. For children aged 6-11, the percentage with obesity was highest for Hispanic children and lowest for non-Hispanic Asian children. For children aged 6-11, the difference between the highest (Hispanic) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) percentages was 15.2 percentage points. In 2011-2014 for adolescents aged 12-19, the percentage with obesity was highest for Hispanic adolescents and lowest for non-Hispanic Asian adolescents. The difference between the highest (Hispanic) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) percentages was 13.4 percentage points for adolescents aged 12-19 years. Hypertension In 2011-2014, non-Hispanic black men and women were the most likely to have hypertension compared with adults in the other racial and ethnic groups. Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure, and other health conditions (80,81). In 2011-2014, 84.1% of adults with hypertension were aware of their status, and 76.1% were taking medication to lower their blood pressure (82). Despite improvement in increasing the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension among minority groups remains a challenge (83). Hypertension is defined as reporting taking antihypertensive medication and/or having a measured systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg or a measured diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg. The age-adjusted percentage of adults aged 20 and over with hypertension was stable during 1999-2014 (30.8% in 2013-2014) (data table for Figure 23). During 1999-2014, non-Hispanic black adults had the highest percentage with [[Page H3745]] hypertension among the three racial and ethnic groups (42.7%, age-adjusted in 2013-2014), while with the exception of 1999- 2000, adults of Mexican origin had the lowest percentage with hypertension (28.8%, age-adjusted in 2013-2014). The difference between the highest and lowest age-adjusted percentages of adults with hypertension among the three racial and ethnic groups was stable during 1999-2014; in 2013-2014, the difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (Mexican-origin) percentages was 13.9 percentage points. In 2011-2014, the age-adjusted percentage of adult men and women with hypertension was similar (31.0% and 29.7%, respectively, data table for Figure 23). The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (Hispanic) age-adjusted percentages of men with hypertension among the four racial and ethnic groups was 14.7 percentage points; for women, the difference between the highest (non- Hispanic black) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) was 19.0 percentage points in 2011-2014. Current Cigarette Smoking During 1999-2014, differences in cigarette smoking between racial and ethnic groups were larger for women than for men. Smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year, accounting for about one in five deaths in the United States (84). Smokers are more likely to develop heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Smoking also increases the risk for diabetes, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis, and stillbirth (85). During 1999-2014, the age-adjusted percentage of adults aged 18 and over who were current cigarette smokers decreased from 25.2% to 19.0% for men and from 21.6% to 15.1% for women (data table for Figure 24). Within each of the four racial and ethnic groups, men were more likely to be current cigarette smokers than women. In 2014 for men, the age-adjusted percentage of current cigarette smokers was highest for non-Hispanic black men (22.0%) and lowest for Hispanic men (13.8%). The difference between the highest and lowest age-adjusted percentages of current cigarette smokers among the four racial and ethnic groups remained stable during 1999-2014 because levels for men in all racial and ethnic groups declined similarly during this period. The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (Hispanic) percentages for men was 8.2 percentage points in 2014. For women, non-Hispanic white women consistently had the highest age-adjusted percentage of current cigarette smokers among the four racial and ethnic groups throughout 1999-2014 (18.3% in 2014), while non-Hispanic Asian women had the lowest age-adjusted percentage (5.1% in 2014). For women, the difference between the highest (non-Hispanic white) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) percentages narrowed from 17.5 percentage points in 1999 to 13.2 in 2014. During 1999-2014, racial and ethnic differences in cigarette smoking prevalence were larger for women than for men. Influenza Vaccination During 1999-2014, influenza vaccination was highest for those aged 65 and over and lowest for those aged 18-64, for all racial and ethnic groups. Influenza is a serious illness that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. Influenza vaccination is especially important for people who are at risk of getting seriously ill from influenza, including those with chronic conditions, older adults, and young children. The percentage of adults aged 18-64 who received an influenza vaccination in the past 12 months remained stable during 1999-2006 and then increased to 35.8% in 2014 (data table for Figure 25). This pattern was present for all racial and ethnic groups. Decreases in influenza vaccination coverage in 2005 were related to a vaccine shortage (86). For those aged 18-64, no racial and ethnic group was consistently the most likely to receive influenza vaccination during 1999- 2014. In 2014, non-Hispanic Asian adults had the highest percentage for influenza vaccination receipt (41.3%) and Hispanic adults had the lowest percentage (27.9%). For adults aged 18-64, the difference between the highest and lowest percentages of adults receiving an influenza vaccination among the four racial and ethnic groups widened from 6.9 percentage points in 1999 (non-Hispanic white compared with Hispanic) to 13.4 in 2014 (non-Hispanic Asian compared with Hispanic). For adults aged 65 and over, the percentage who received an influenza vaccination in the past 12 months increased from 65.7% to 70.1% during 1999-2014. During this period, trends in influenza vaccination coverage varied by racial and ethnic group, and no racial and ethnic group was consistently the most or least likely to receive influenza vaccination. In 2014, non-Hispanic Asian adults had the highest percentage for receipt of influenza vaccination (72.7%) and non-Hispanic black adults had the lowest (57.4%). For adults age 65 and over, the difference between the highest (non-Hispanic Asian) and lowest (non-Hispanic black) percentages of older adults receiving an influenza vaccination among the four racial and ethnic groups was stable during 1999-2003 and then narrowed to 15.3 percentage points in 2014. Health Insurance Coverage During 1999 through the first 6 months of 2015 among adults aged 18-64, lack of health insurance coverage was highest among Hispanic adults. Health insurance is a major determinant of access to health care. Children are less likely to be uninsured than adults aged 18-64 because they are more likely to qualify for public coverage, primarily Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (see data table for Figure 26 for estimates for children) (26,87). Passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 (38) authorized states to expand Medicaid eligibility (88) and to establish the health insurance marketplace in 2014. For adults aged 18-64, the percentage without coverage increased from 17.9% to 20.5% during 1999-2013, and then decreased to 12.7% in the first 6 months of 2015 (36). During this period, the trend for lack of coverage varied by racial and ethnic group. During 1999-June 2015, Hispanic adults aged 18-64 had the highest percentage without coverage (27.2% in the first 6 months of 2015), and non-Hispanic white adults aged 18-64 had the lowest, except in the first 6 months of 2015, when non- Hispanic Asian adults had the lowest percentage without coverage. The difference between the highest and lowest percentages of adults aged 18-64 without health insurance among the four racial and ethnic groups narrowed from 1999-June 2015. This difference was 24.9 percentage points in 1999 (Hispanic adults compared with non-Hispanic white adults) and 19.9 percentage points in the first 6 months of 2015 (Hispanic adults compared with non-Hispanic Asian adults). Difficulty Accessing Needed Dental Care Due to Cost During 1999-2014 among adults aged 18-64, nonreceipt of needed dental care due to cost was lowest among non-Hispanic Asian adults. Oral health is integral to general health and wellbeing, and forgoing needed dental health care can have serious health effects (89). In general, fewer adults have dental coverage than medical coverage, and dental coverage tends to be less comprehensive (90-92). In 2012, 44% of dental expenditures among adults aged 18-64 were paid out of pocket, a higher out-of-pocket percentage than for any other type of personal health care expenditure (93). The percentage of adults aged 18-64 who did not receive needed dental care in the past 12 months due to cost increased from 9.3% to 17.3% during 1999-2010, and then decreased to 12.6% in 2014 (data table for Figure 27). During 1999-2014, non-Hispanic Asian adults aged 18-64 had the lowest percentage of not receiving needed dental care due to cost (6.3% in 2014) among the four racial and ethnic groups. No racial and ethnic group consistently had the highest percentage of not receiving needed dental care due to cost during 1999-2014. The difference between the highest and lowest percentages of adults not receiving needed dental care due to cost among the four racial and ethnic groups widened during 1999-2010, and then remained stable from 2010-2014 for those aged 18-64. This difference was 5.9 percentage points in 1999 (non-Hispanic black compared with non-Hispanic Asian) and 9.4 percentage points in 2014 (Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic Asian). Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot tonight. We have heard the call to action by Members. We have heard the relationship to poverty in health disparities, to the socioeconomic conditions of African Americans to health disparities. We have heard the relationship to death by guns to health disparities. We have heard the data and the statistics about the mortality rates from diseases like cardiovascular disease, the leading killer for women and African American women and men. We have heard about the effect of untreated diabetes and how that affects African Americans. The list goes on and on, Madam Speaker. I could tell you whether it is obesity, whether it is stroke--and certainly as a stroke survivor, I understand firsthand the value and the importance of quality, affordable health care--that there are some Federal programs that actually work and bridge the gap. I could say wonderful things about the United States Health and Human Services Office of Minority Affairs that provides data and research and services for us. But before I ask my colleague, Madam Speaker, to say a few words, I ran across something that was said, in my opinion, by one of the most powerful individuals that will go down in current history. And 20 years from now, Madam Speaker, if I were standing here talking about his legacy, health care would be one of them. Let me conclude my part with these brief words that he quoted on April 1 of this year: ``Our Nation was built on an enduring belief that we are all created equal--regardless of the color of our skin or the station into which we were born. From the ambitions we hold for ourselves to the way we take care of our health, this founding premise serves as the guidepost of our national life.'' Yet, to this day, Madam Speaker, minorities continue to experience the [[Page H3746]] healthcare gaps that leave their communities our communities. I will add this to his ending that, Madam Speaker, tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus asks that we recommit to taking action to overcome these disparities. And that person who will leave a great legacy for these words is no other than our President of these United States, President Barack Obama. And now as we begin to close our hour, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries). I could not think of a better colleague, a better coanchor, to come and share with us our call to action. My colleague and classmate, Congressman Jeffries, is a scholar, someone who sits back, listens, and then comes with resolve. He is someone who is no stranger to this process of telling it like it is. He is someone who has spent a lot of time and years with his experience to speak for the individuals of his district. But tonight, Madam Speaker, I asked him to speak for the Congressional Black Caucus. I asked him to close us out on our call for action as we talk about the health disparities in our African American communities. Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio, and our phenomenal anchor for this CBC Special Order hour today and throughout the second session of the 114th Congress. It has been an honor and a privilege to work closely with her. She has done such a phenomenal job, not just on behalf of the people she represents in the great city of Columbus, Ohio, but all throughout the Nation in her various roles, and certainly in her leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus. It is with a heavy heart that I stand on the floor of the House of Representatives today and, with great sadness, acknowledge the pain and the suffering and extend my condolences to those who have suffered this great tragedy in Orlando, Florida, the worst mass shooting in the history of the United States of America. It is a complicated shooting. We understand that it most likely is an act of terror, a hate crime of unspeakable proportions. There are indications that the shooter may have some degree of mental illness and a history of domestic abuse. The shooter appeared to have been, in some measure, on the FBI's radar. But you can add all those things up and there is still something that is missing that we here in Congress have the capacity to deal with, and that is the fact that one individual was able to purchase a weapon of mass destruction--which should be reserved for war, not the hunting of human beings in this great democratic Republic--and inflict death on 49 individuals and maim in ways that are inhumane to more than 50 others. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said: ``In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.'' During the 114th Congress, there have been more than 100 mass shootings. We often come to the floor of the House of Representatives and the Speaker or one of his designees stands at the rostrum and asks us, as Members of the House, to stand in a moment of silence. And then we go on with business as usual, having done nothing about the tremendous gun violence problem that we have in America. The rest of the world is looking around and saying: What are they doing in the United States of America? Five percent of the world's population, 50 percent of the world's guns. It is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns circulating throughout this great land. The FBI and local law enforcement can't tell you where the overwhelming majority of them are because of legislative silence and malpractice. This is an issue, of course, that has great impact on the African American community. Homicides are the leading cause of death through guns of younger African American men. So we in the CBC view it as a public health crisis certainly for our community. I think it is one that all Americans should view as a health crisis for the entire country. But the thing that is also troubling--and we will have time to deal with this tragedy--is hopefully we will be able to take some commonsense steps in the right direction, including making sure that individuals who are on the terrorist watch list can't purchase weapons of mass destruction. How complicated is that to do? But the thing that is striking for many of us in the African American community is that, when you look at some of the leading causes of death--heart disease being number one, and then, of course, diabetes and childhood obesity being problematic, certain forms of cancer, HIV/ AIDS infection--many of these illnesses, these ailments that plague the neighborhoods that I represent in central Brooklyn, in Bedford- Stuyvesant, in East New York, in Ocean Hill-Brownsville, in Canarsie, and in the west end of Coney Island, are preventable, preventable by better exercise, preventable by dealing with some of the environmental racism that many low-income communities of color have been subjected to, resulting in incredibly high rates of asthma and other forms of respiratory illness, preventable by better diet. Senator Booker recently said to many of us--and this has stuck with me--that more African Americans in the United States of America die as a result of drive-throughs, not drive-bys. That is because the diet, the access to healthy food, is limited. The food deserts within which many African Americans, particularly at the lowest socioeconomic level, are forced to reside in are scandalous. So we in the Congressional Black Caucus believe that we have to deal with these issues in a more meaningful, comprehensive fashion. I am thankful that back at home in the west end of Coney Island, Coney Island Cathedral, one of the most important religious institutions in Brooklyn, is actively engaged in a public health campaign to deal with diabetes and heart disease and many of the other ailments that result from a poor diet that exists, a lack of access to healthy food in the Black community. It is a campaign that we want to take across the Nation. We are thankful for the work that has been done by the Congressional Black Caucus and by President Obama through his leadership of the Affordable Care Act. We now know that over 20 million previously uninsured Americans now have access to quality, affordable health care--disproportionately African American. That is a positive step in the right direction. But instead of trying to dismantle this monumental step forward, as House Republicans have attempted to do more than 60 times over the last few years, they have a clinical obsession with a law that has been declared constitutional-- not once, but twice--by the United States Supreme Court. Let's figure out ways to come together as a nation, despite our racial, religious, and ethnic differences, to deal with the disparities that exist in the African American community and beyond. And let us come together as a Congress and as a nation to deal with the scourge of hate, in its most recent form, directed at the LGBT community down in Orlando in such a horrific and invidious fashion. We are better than this. We can do much better here in the United States Congress. The Congressional Black Caucus is here to lead the way on issues, worked in partnership hand in hand with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if they are just willing to meet us some of the way, to deal with the issues of health disparities in the African American community and deal with the scourge of gun violence that takes our young boys and girls in shocking numbers and also impacts people all across the country. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her leadership and for once again yielding to me and anchoring this Special Order in such a phenomenal way. Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Jeffries. Madam Speaker, as we close out tonight, I can't think of a better way to take my last 30 seconds than to speak to you and to speak to America and to ask that we take these last seconds in silence as a call to action to prevent the guns being on the street, as a call to action to reduce the health disparities. But in honor of the families in Orlando, we give them our commitment that we stand with them and that I stand with all of my friends and constituents and supporters who belong to the LGBT community. [[Page H3747]] I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of the special order hour titled ``Bridging the Divide: A Call to Action by the Congressional Black Caucus to Eliminate Racial Health Disparities.'' I would like to thank my colleagues Congressman Hakeem Jeffries and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty for hosting this timely special order. Historically, racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have the highest uninsured rates and are less likely to receive preventive and quality health care. While the Affordable Care Act has helped minorities afford health insurance and access quality care, there is still a need to eliminate existing disparities. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services is currently working to expand access, end racial and ethnic discrimination, perform outreach to underserved communities, improve workforce diversity, and expand data collection and reporting. While this is an ambitious plan, it is one that is extremely necessary. Unfortunately, coverage, access, and outreach may not be the only keys to eliminating disparities. Demographic characteristics contribute heavily to racial and ethnic health status. For example, research shows that privately insured African American and Hispanic adults fare worse than privately insured white adults along measures to access and use of care. Unfortunately, African Americans and Hispanics are less likely to have a regular provider than their white counterparts. The same research also showed that privately insured African Americans and Hispanics had less confidence in their ability to pay for medical costs. Since social determinants like economic stability, education, and environment play such a large role in how we each view and access health care, many of the changes necessary to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities require a much larger plan than just a focus on health-related programs. Reducing disparities in health truly entails addressing racial and ethnic social determinants such as availability of safe housing, affordable food, access to education, job opportunities, community-based resources, public safety, public transportation, and more. Our society must make many changes before we can truly eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities because that also means eliminating disparities in many other sectors. I thank Congressman Jeffries and Congresswoman Beatty for hosting this poignant special order. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3737-H3747] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 BRIDGING THE DIVIDE: A CALL TO ACTION BY THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS TO ELIMINATE RACIAL HEALTH DISPARITIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous materials relevant to the subject matter of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening, along with my colleague, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of the Eighth Congressional District of New York, for tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, Bridging the Divide: A Call to Action By the Congressional Black Caucus to Eliminate Racial Health Disparities. Mr. Speaker, tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus comes to the House floor to discuss our overarching goal of promoting equality for African Americans across the healthcare spectrum. Mr. Speaker, it is well known that poverty, socioeconomic status, and health disparities are closely linked and latched together. For example, individuals with low incomes tend to have more restricted access to medical care and face greater financial barriers to affordable health care, oftentimes contributing to health disparities. Last week, Mr. Speaker, the House Republicans released their Conference's poverty plan called A Better Way. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, this Republican antipoverty proposal isn't a better way, Mr. Speaker. It isn't even a new way. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, it is the wrong way. It uses the same trickle-down, discredited policies that House Republicans have put forth in the past. The House Republicans' poverty elimination proposal would repeal the Affordable Care Act and undermine affordable, quality health coverage that millions of Americans are now enjoying. It would also cut Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program that we refer to as CHIP, and it would end the Medicare guarantee--programs with proven successes, Mr. Speaker, in reducing health disparities. So this is, in part, why we are here tonight. We know that health coverage is the first step in securing better healthcare outcomes, and Medicaid and CHIP play a vital role in opening the doorway to the needed health care, especially for our children. As we address the most pressing challenges in achieving health equity and equality for African Americans, I want hardworking American families to know that they have voices in Congress that aim to protect their safety, invest in their future, and provide affordable health care for all. With the Affordable Care Act, which every member of the Congressional Black Caucus supported when it passed, we have improved access. We have improved affordability and quality of health care. So tonight, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank President Obama for moving the needle forward in helping American families and African American families across this great country and Nation to have the financial and health security that comes with health care. [[Page H3738]] Mr. Speaker, we cannot repeal the ACA. We must continue to improve and strengthen it, and we will still have more work to do. The Congressional Black Caucus, from its very inception, has long been the voice for bridging the divide on racial healthcare disparities. No, Mr. Speaker; we have been the voice for standing up for American people, and especially individuals who are African American, against all disparities. We will not only come to this floor tonight. We will continue our fight and we will continue to come to this floor. Tonight, you are going to hear a lot of our members weave together our poverty plan. You are going to have members talk about gun violence. You are going to have members talk about all lives matter. If we don't end the gun violence, then we are not going to have a healthy nation. Tonight, I want to applaud my good friend and colleague, Congresswoman Robin Kelly of the Second District of Illinois, chair of our Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust. I want to commend her for her report, the 2015 Kelly Report on Health Disparities in America, the official congressional analysis of the state of African Americans' health in the United States, and her work on the 40 Under 40 Leaders in Health Awards, leaders under 40 who are physicians and medical professionals. And lastly, let me just thank her for her courage and her leadership for recognizing that all lives matter. We cannot come to this House floor and talk about poverty programs and health care and education and about finance if we do not bridge the gap with gun violence. I salute her for no longer standing up until we make a difference. So tonight, we are coming, Mr. Speaker, with a strong call to action for us to keep this wonderful America healthy. You will hear from Congresswoman Kelly momentarily. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. He is a chairman who has been a longtime advocate and voice for not only the Congressional Black Caucus, but for his constituents in his congressional district in North Carolina. Tonight, he speaks for us. Tonight, he speaks for the call of action of us to bridge the gap. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. I thank Congresswoman Beatty for yielding to me this evening. This is such a sad evening for all of us because of the events in Orlando. I thank her so very much for having the strength to come to the floor tonight to manage the important topic that we are all so concerned about. I thank Congresswoman Robin Kelly for her incredible work chairing the CBC Health Braintrust and all the work she does related to health disparities in this country. I thank all of my colleagues for their tireless work. Before I begin my remarks, let me just say that I sat on the floor a moment ago and listened to Congresswoman Corrine Brown. It was an incredible 1-minute speech she gave. I want to share in her sentiments this evening and align myself with the pain that she and her constituents are facing in Orlando. The mass shootings were absolutely horrific and unthinkable, under any definition. They are just unthinkable. My prayers go out to the families in Orlando for their pain and for all that they are having to endure because of these mass shootings. As someone said a few moments ago, a moment of silence is not enough. It is time for this Congress to act. It is time for this body, Mr. Speaker, to have a serious debate about gun violence and to pass legislation that will deprive people the right to own a high-capacity assault weapon and high-caliber bullets and use them to kill innocent people. Now is the time. 136 mass shootings have taken place during the first 164 days of this year. It is a sad statistic that we must address. The United States is 5 percent of the world's population, yet we are 31 percent of the mass shootings in the world. It is time to act. Let me talk about the topic tonight, very briefly. The Congressional Black Caucus has been committed to advancing access to affordable health care for all Americans so that we can eliminate racially based health disparities. That has been our mission for many years. Eliminating health disparities means addressing inequities in environmental, social, and economic conditions in all of our communities. By all measurable statistics, from health outcomes to participation in health professions, African Americans lag so far behind. For example, more than 40 percent of African Americans have high blood pressure--a rate that is one of the highest in the world. African Americans are more likely to develop hypertension at a younger age and are at higher risk of stroke, heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and death from heart disease. Stroke, Mr. Speaker, is the third leading cause of death in the United States. African Americans are 50 percent more likely to experience a stroke than White Americans. That is a fact. According to the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, African American children are twice as likely to have asthma as White children, and Black children are 10 times more likely than White children to die of complications from asthma. African Americans were, on average, 6 years younger than Whites when they suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest incidence among African American men was 175 per 100,000; whereas, the incidence for White males was just 84 per 100,000. Cardiac arrest in African American women was 90 per 100,000, as opposed to 40 per 100,000 for Caucasian women. Another illness which disparately impacts the African American community is that of prostate cancer. In June of last year, I introduced the National Prostate Cancer Plan Act, a bipartisan bill which seeks to establish the National Prostate Cancer Council on Screening, Early Detection and Assessment and Monitoring of Prostate Cancer. Prostate cancer impacts one in seven American men and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the U.S., with nearly 30,000 deaths anticipated just this year. African American men are particularly vulnerable, as they are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 2.5 times more likely to die from the disease than their White counterparts. Just last week, House Republicans released their A Better Way agenda to address poverty, but that proposal, like others they have released, will not lift Americans out of poverty. In some cases, these types of proposals can actually push low-income Americans even deeper into poverty, further limiting their access to health care and exacerbating health disparities. So, Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to continue our efforts to address the health disparities and barriers. That is what the Congressional Black Caucus is advocating the evening. We are going to continue this work until every disparity is removed. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank Congressman Butterfield for making us aware of 136 mass shootings in 164 days of this year. Certainly, that is relevant to tonight's topic, because whether it is death by guns or death by healthcare disparities, there are too many deaths. I think you said it so well when you provided the data and the statistics of African American men and their mortality rates and what is happening to them. And yes, African Americans lag behind, and that is why we stand with you bridging the gap and for this call of action. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) from the Second Congressional District, my colleague, my confidant, and my friend. She is a champion of expanding health care. She is a champion, Mr. Speaker, of making sure that we understand that healthcare disparities must end. She is the chair of the powerful and most prestigious Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust. She strives to increase healthcare opportunities for all: for our children, for our senior citizens, and for residents of the underserved communities. It is my honor to ask her to provide some information on today's topic. {time} 2000 Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues and my classmates, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), my friend, and the distinguished gentleman from New [[Page H3739]] York (Mr. Jeffries), for leading this important conversation about bridging the divide to eliminate racial health disparities. But I can't weigh in on that topic until I first address the horrific events of yesterday in Orlando, Florida. Our Nation is horrified and heartbroken by the tragedy in Orlando. We are disgusted by this brutal attack. We will not tolerate terrorism or hate in any form against any group of people because this is just not our way. These ideas of hate will not endure because there is not strength to them. We will win the battle against terrorism and intolerance. We will hold leaders accountable who put their NRA score ahead of the need to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists. We will stand with the LGBTQ community and value their lives, their health, and their security from the threat of violence and hate. And we will work to see that all Americans enjoy the very same freedoms and protections. We have done a lot of moments of silence, but I believe in showing respect through action, not silence, and that is why we are here this evening to discuss what divides us as a country in a health sense. For 45 years, the Congressional Black Caucus has been out front in Congress in fighting for these freedoms and protections. And when it comes to the matter of health equity, I have worked to champion the health policy concerns of vulnerable communities as my predecessors in the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, the Honorable Louis Stokes and Dr. Christensen, have done. Some of my colleagues here know this, but I want to repeat it for anyone who doesn't. Before he was killed, Martin Luther King, Jr., was quoted as saying: ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' I couldn't agree more, and as the chair of the Health Braintrust, I have worked with many of the people in this room to focus on advancing this critical phase of the human rights and civil rights struggle: health equity. When Benjamin Franklin created the Nation's first public hospital, The Pennsylvania Hospital, he did so in order to establish the promotion of public health as a core American value. He did so to care for our Nation's diseased and sick poor. Nearly 300 years later, the Affordable Care Act cemented health care as a fundamental right for all Americans. Yet, today, we find ourselves at a crossroads in health care. Health disparities in communities of color continue to be intractable hurdles in the quest to achieve health equity in America. African Americans are infected with HIV at a rate that is 8 times that of White Americans. While White women are more likely to have breast cancer, African American women are 40 percent more likely to die from the disease. African Americans, Latinos, Asians, and Pacific Islanders, as well as Native Americans, are diagnosed with lupus two to three times more frequently than Caucasians. More than 13 percent of African Americans aged 20 or older have diagnosed diabetes. And people of color are two to four times more likely than Whites to reach end-stage renal disease. This grim snapshot illustrates that, despite the gains we have made since the days of Ben Franklin and the ACA, there is still much ground to cover in closing the health equity gap. Last year, I drafted a comprehensive report, The Kelly Report on Health Disparities, an official Congressional analysis of the state of minority health in the U.S. that offers a blueprint for reversing negative health trends in communities of color. The Kelly Report brought Members of Congress together, medical professionals, and public health thought leaders to examine the root causes and impact of health disparities in America, and provide a comprehensive set of legislative and policy recommendations to address them. The whole can only ever be as healthy as its parts. For America to achieve true health equity, lawmakers, community leaders, and industry stakeholders must come together and aggressively work to reduce disparities nationwide. We all have a part to play in creating a healthier America. We must take heed of Dr. King's words: ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' And we can and we must fix that. Again, because of what happened in Orlando, and I want to say it is the mass shooting that we are talking about, and it is tragic, but the night before, one person was shot. And I often liken this to a 747 crash as we talk about that, but we don't talk about the two-seater. And that two-seater, the person that died alone in that club after she sung Friday night has a brother, a mother, a father, and their pain is just as harsh. So let's not forget that young lady that lost her life. And she did not lose her life to someone that was Muslim or someone that believed in ISIS. She lost her life to an American young man, a Caucasian. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois, (Ms. Kelly). And how appropriate for tonight for the gentlewoman to remind us, as I ask her to constantly do, about why we must, to put it in her words, come together. We must do something. Madam Speaker, tonight we say to you and to our Republican colleagues: Come together and do something. I say to the gentlewoman, Congresswoman Kelly: Let today serve as a turning point in our Nation's ongoing struggle to stamp out hate of all forms. We must mourn those who lost their family members, but we must do more than mourn. We must have action. If we are going to have a hope for a better America, hate has no place in this great Nation. So I thank the gentlewoman, and I will continue to remind others that we know firsthand what it does to our community. But, Madam Speaker, we stand here tonight speaking to all communities. But here is what we know. The NAACP has shared with us that African American children and teens accounted for 45 percent of all child and teen gun deaths in 2008 and 2009, but were only 15 percent of the total child population. The FBI says that approximately 47 percent of victims of the 165,000 homicides from 2000 to 2010, including over 111,000 gun-related homicides, were Black. The Children's Defense Fund, Madam Speaker, says that in 2010, Black males between the ages of 15 and 19 were nearly 30 times more likely to die in a gun homicide than White males of the same age, and more than three times more likely to die in a gun homicide than Hispanic males of the same age. So, Madam Speaker, tonight you will hear us repeatedly make a call for action. You will hear us repeatedly quote great leaders. And I think it is worth quoting again what Congresswoman Kelly said, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King: ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane'' of all inequalities, of all injustices. As we speak of great leaders, it is, indeed, my honor and my privilege to ask my colleague, the gentleman from the 10th Congressional District of New Jersey (Mr. Payne), a man who has made a name for himself, a man who understands firsthand as a father of triplets, as a spouse, as a ranking member on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, a man who has been at the forefront in his community, a man who served before coming here as an elected official, but, more importantly, a person who understands health disparities and the call for action--it gives me great honor to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) to share some wisdom with us tonight. Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I first want to start by thanking Congresswoman Beatty for that very kind and generous introduction. We, in our class, are very proud of our colleagues, and we support each other in times of need. I just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, the gentleman from New York, who is also host of this Special Order. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me. Before I begin, I just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible [[Page H3740]] tragedy in Orlando, and I can only imagine what they are going through. The other thing that is illuminating to me is that, as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence, after that moment of silence, I believe Members were given a 1-minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor, as is customary, and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in Orlando. So not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this House, but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle. Madam Speaker, eliminating racial-based health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all. Even in the 21st century, health disparities are stark, especially in the African American communities, where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among Whites. Today, despite improvement in overall health in the United States, African Americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas, including access to quality care, timelines of care, and health outcomes. For years, the Congressional Black Caucus has called on Republicans to join us and other House Democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities, a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities, such as inequities in environmental, social, and economic conditions in our communities. Instead, we get from them proposals like their so-called A Better Way poverty proposal, a stale, repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about Americans trapped in poverty. Cutting job training programs, food assistance, and Head Start will push low-income Americans further into poverty, making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their well-being and the well-being of their families. We need to, instead, use the government as a source of good. Every American deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment. Yet, low-income and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution, resulting in serious health problems such as asthma, heart problems, and cancer. This is a very real problem across America, a very real problem in my district. Thirteen million people, including 3.5 million children, are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution. {time} 2015 My district is home to the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, part of the Port of New York and New Jersey, the third largest port in the country. According to the EPA, 25 percent of children in Newark suffer from asthma--three times the State average. What we need are additional Federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system. The issue is critical to the low-income and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards. Now, since I am on the topic of environmental justice, I just want to remind everyone that the Republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in Flint, including a vote to block the Families of Flint Act emergency supplemental. Their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for American families, and, I think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities. The way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable. It is to address the environmental, social, and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities. It is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes. It is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations. In closing, Madam Speaker, I also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racial-based health disparities. African Americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor provider-patient communication and health literacy issues. Consequently, they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions. We have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find, understand, and use the information and services. As co-chair of the Congressional Men's Health Caucus, I have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and well-being. So I encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions, to get the security you and your family deserve, and to get the health care that we all need. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank Congressman Payne so much for giving us such compelling information and data and reminding us that the time is now for us to enact those programs that work, and the time is now for us to understand what is at risk. Also, let me thank the gentleman for his role on the Congressional Men's Health Caucus. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from the State of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The gentlewoman from the 18th Congressional District of Texas is someone who I am always amazed when she comes to the mic, someone who is well researched, and someone who delivers an oratorical message that makes us take pause and pay attention. Tonight, I would like to say that Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is a movement. Earlier, I heard her use that word in talk about how we, Madam Speaker, must be the movement against violence, that we must be leading that movement against these disparities in health care. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, there is no doubt how much I appreciate the Congressional Black Caucus and Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman Jeffries for always being timely in allowing us to give a message to our colleagues. We hope maybe the American people will hear us, but we accept that this body is the body to which and to whom we speak. So I am thankful for that. I want to pay tribute, overall, to the Congressional Black Caucus because we are actually here speaking of health disparities, because it was the caucus that triggered this debate through the years that we have been trying to get universal access to health care and was the moving force in the 2009, 2008, and 2010 passage, ultimately, of the Affordable Care Act, where the work that we did, joining Congresswoman Donna Christian-Christiansen, at that time, and Frank Pallone on the Congressional Health Caucus, but on the CBC we had the health disparities task to ensure that the language in the Affordable Care Act addressed the issue of health disparities. There was a large section on that that built on some of the work that some of us had already done creating the Office of Minority Health that I had worked on in years past. So it was the lightning bolt of the caucus, and then working with the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and then the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that we raised the issue that no one was talking about. I remember debating on the floor of the House on the issues of dealing with senior citizen African American men and how they access health care, how do women access health care, and how do women impacted by diabetes access health care. These are some of the diseases that have a proclivity to the African American population. We were finding out that we even had an issue where medical professionals didn't know how to ask the questions. How do you address someone who needs to be diagnosed for prostate cancer or may be diagnosed for prostate cancer and is an African American male, a senior citizen? My father ultimately died from cancer that metastasized from the prostate to the lungs and the brain, so we knew we had a serious issue. [[Page H3741]] So today, I want to mention four points, but I am going to focus on the last one, obesity--a question of access to health care and physical fitness. Many times we live in areas where there is no access to a pool or a tennis court. Mental health--if you lived your life in a segregated America, if you were called ``Boy'' and ``Girl,'' it is a different mental health situation than maybe others may have faced. If you live in a situation of poverty, of a single household, maybe--this is not across the board--these issues will be impacted. If you lived around gun violence, if you saw your 15-year-old friend being shot dead in the street, there is a question of mental health that we need access to that care for us to be able to reach out or maybe counselors to be able to provide for children. HIV/AIDS is something that we have lived through. I remember going to funerals of friends in the 1980s and into the 1990s, particularly with HIV/AIDS. So we have worked in the Congressional Black Caucus to massively talk about testing. Let me get to this point that I want to dwell just for a moment on, and that is gun violence. I was here on the floor earlier with my head held down and my heart heavy as my district, today, had a memorial. They had one yesterday. We will have one tomorrow and have one on Wednesday. I mourn with Congresswoman Corinne Brown of Florida. We are offering legislation dealing with the assault weapons and to complement legislation already passed or already in place. But it is important to note that this is a health issue, because the Centers for Disease Control can assess and study every health issue that faces America today, but they are legislatively, by law, prohibited by my friends on other side of the aisle, by Republicans, disallowed every year to give them permission to study gun violence. Gun violence is killing our children and killing our families. In Orlando, it killed Latinos who happened to be the attendees at the Pulse Club. The LGBTQ community was the dominant community, and a hateful terroristic act using AR-15s and Glock guns killed them. The incident was the deadliest mass shooting. The next deadliest incidents in recent history were April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech, 32 killed, 17 injured; December 14, 2012, Sandy Hook, 26 killed, 1 injured; October 16, 1991, Killeen, Texas, 23 killed, 27 injured. According to Everytown index of mass shootings where four or more people are shot and killed, the incident was the ninth mass shooting in the United States in 2016, and the 150th mass shooting in United States since January 1, 2009. The mass shooting with guns impacts both the mental health, the sanctity, and the minority community. It is shameful that we are not allowed to engage in the kind of research that a Harvard professor talked about, and that is the assessing of violence and the assessing of violence with guns. The materials I have before me make it very clear that most of these violent acts are done with guns--done with guns. San Bernardino, Chattanooga, Charleston, Garland, Oak Creek, and Fort Hood were all done with guns. So I stand here today to challenge this issue of health disparities to say that the heavy brunt of killings, singular killings, are impacted by poverty, lack of access to health care, the proliferation of guns in our inner city communities, and the failure of the United States Congress to put real gun safety legislation, closing the loophole, the Jim Clyburn rule that says that, if you don't get the review and approval by ATF, you do not get the gun. You have to wait until you get the approval from ATF, which may be trying to determine whether this person with multiple problems, mental health or background issues, doesn't need to get a gun and then ultimately go kill their spouse, their children, their neighbors, their family members or strangers. So it is my belief today that this health disparities debate is crucial, and we should come away from here recognizing that obesity, the issues of mental health and HIV/AIDS can be, with great investment, researched for cures, or cancer that proliferates in our community, triple negative breast cancer, legislation that I have put forward and have gotten passed about that impact. But it is the gun violence that we are doing absolutely nothing about. The disparities and the impact on minority communities is atrocious. I want to close simply by saying the word or the acronym LGBTQ community. I want to say it over and over again, because I think it is shameful that, in our debate, in our recognition of the tragedy of Orlando, that we don't acknowledge the horrific hate crime and the hatefulness against that community. As I stand here, that community is diverse, and there are African Americans who are LGBTQ. So I would ask that, as we move forward this week, we will be reminded of this hatefulness and we will have a cure. We will be reminded of this violence, and we will have a cure. That cure, first of all, will be to restrain the use of assault weapons and these weapons of war-type bullets that men and women in the United States military say have no business on the streets of America. I believe, Congresswoman, that health disparities are an important wall and division to overcome. I thank the gentlewoman for having this Special Order to ensure that we will confront these issues and try to save lives. Racial disparities refer to the variation in rates of disease occurrence and disabilities between socioeconomic and/or geographically defined population groups. I want to focus on four areas of racial disparities in health that impact African Americans that we can do something about: 1. Obesity; 2. Mental Health; 3. HIV/AIDS; and 4. Gun Violence. African Americans, based on 2015 Census data, comprise 13.2 percent of the U.S. population, or about 42 million people. Socioeconomic status, in turn, is linked to mental health: People who are impoverished, homeless, incarcerated or have substance abuse problems are at higher risk for poor mental health. As the founder and chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I am especially concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic among African-American youth. More than 40 percent of African American teenagers are overweight, and nearly 25 percent are obese. The percentage of children aged 6-11 years in the United States who were obese increased from 7 percent in 1980 to nearly 18 percent in 2012. African American youth are consuming less nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables and are not getting enough physical exercise. This combination has led to an epidemic of obesity, which directly contributes to numerous deadly or life-threatening diseases or conditions, including the following: Hypertension; Dyslipidemia (High Cholesterol or High Triglyceride Levels); Type 2 Diabetes; Coronary Heart Disease; Stroke; Gallbladder Disease; Osteoarthritis; Asthma, bronchitis, sleep apnea, and other respiratory problems; Cancer (Breast, Colon, and Endometrial). When ethnicity and income are considered, the picture is even more troubling. African American youngsters from low-income families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higher-income families. Efforts such as the Let's Move! Campaign by the First Lady are pivotal to ensuring that communities are able to provide healthy snacks and food and encourage healthier decisions. Since the mid-1970s, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children. Non-Hispanic blacks have the highest age-adjusted rates of obesity at 47.8 percent. According to the CDC, 37.6 percent of men and 56.9 percent of women twenty years and over are obese. Every year, more than 40 million Americans struggle with mental illness. African American men are as likely as anyone else to have mental illness, but they are less likely to get help. Racism continues to have an impact on the mental health of African Americans. Negative stereotypes and attitudes of rejection have decreased, but continue to occur with measurable, adverse consequences. Historical and contemporary instances of negative treatment have led to a mistrust of authorities, many of whom are not seen as having the best interests of African Americans in mind. According to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health: Adult blacks are 20 percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than adult whites. Adult blacks living below poverty are two to three times more likely to report serious psychological distress than those living above poverty. Adult blacks are more likely to have feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness than are adult whites. How African Americans view mental health over generations is a major barrier to accessing mental health services and treatment. [[Page H3742]] In 1996, MHA commissioned a national survey on clinical depression. The survey explored the barriers preventing Americans seeking treatment and gauged overall knowledge of and attitudes toward depression. This survey revealed that: 63 percent of African Americans believe that depression is a personal weakness. This is significantly higher than the overall survey average of 54 percent. Only 31 percent of African Americans believed that depression was a ``health problem.'' African Americans were more likely to believe that depression was ``normal'' than the overall survey average. 56 percent believed that depression was a normal part of aging. 45 percent believed it was normal for a mother to feel depressed for at least two weeks after giving birth. 40 percent believed it was normal for a husband or wife to feel depressed for more than a year after the death of a spouse. Many of these problems persist to this day. As Doctor William Lawson of Howard University (and MHA's District of Columbia affiliate) pointed out in an NPR interview in 2012, ``Many African-Americans have a lot of negative feelings about, or not even aware of mental health services. The ``Mental Health: Culture, Race and Ethnicity Supplement'' to the 1999 U.S. Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health, states the following: African-American physicians are five times more likely than white physicians to treat African-American patients. African-American patients who see African-American physicians rate their physicians' styles of interaction as more participatory. African Americans seeking help for a mental health problem would have trouble finding African American mental health professionals: In 1998, only 2 percent of psychiatrists, 2 percent of psychologists and 4 percent of social workers said they were African Americans. The public mental health safety net of hospitals, community health centers, and local health departments are vital to many African Americans, especially to those in high-need populations. African Americans of all ages are underrepresented in outpatient treatment but over-represented in inpatient treatment. Few African-American children receive treatment in privately funded psychiatric hospitals, but many receive treatment in publicly funded residential treatment centers for emotionally disturbed youth. In 2012, there were an estimated 356,268 inmates with severe mental illnesses in U.S. prisons and jails. There were only 35,000 mentally ill individuals in state psychiatric hospitals. The report, ``The Treatment of Persons With Mental Illness in Prisons and Jails,'' jails ``in 44 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, a prison or jail in that state holds more individuals with serious mental illness than the largest remaining state psychiatric hospital.'' the report said. African Americans today are overrepresented in our jails and prisons. People of color account for 60 percent of the prison population. The Stanford Law School Three Strikes Project's report stated that, ``over the past 15 years, the number of mentally ill people in prison in California has almost doubled.'' In California, 45 percent of state prison inmates have been treated for severe mental illness within the past year. African Americans also account for 14 percent of regular drug users, but for 37 percent of drug arrests. Illicit drug use is frequently associated with self-medication among people with mental illnesses. In January 2014, the Texas Observer reported that, of the 9,000 inmates in Harris County Jail more than 25 percent take medication for mental illness, which means that the jail treats more psychiatric patients than all 10 of Texas' state-run public mental hospitals combined. The passage of the Affordable Care Act created access to health care for those who purchase health insurance and for the poor living in states that are participating in the Medicaid component of the ACA. Disparities can occur, if physicians do not refer patients with signs of mental illness for proper treatment or if referred patients do not seek out treatment. Disparities in access to care and treatment for mental illnesses have also persisted over time. As noted by the Office of Minority Health: Only 8.7 percent of adult blacks, versus 16 percent of adult whites, received treatment for mental health concerns in 2007-2008. Only 6.2 percent of adult blacks, versus 13.9 percent of adult whites, received medications for mental health concerns during 2008. While 68.7 percent of adult whites with a major depressive episode in 2009 received treatment, only 53.2 percent of adult blacks did. The Affordable Care Act will have an impact on this gap by 2016. Depression and other mental illness can be deadly if left untreated. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among African Americans 15 to 24 years old. Untreated mental illness can also make African American men more vulnerable to substance abuse, homelessness, incarceration, and homicide. African Americas are the racial/ethnic group most affected by HIV in the United States. According to the CDC, 44 percent (19,540) of estimated new HIV Diagnoses in the United States were among African Americans, who comprise 12 percent of the US population. HIV/AIDs are now the leading cause of death among African Americans ages 25 to 44--ahead of heart disease, accidents, cancer, and homicide. At the end of 2012, an estimated 496,500 African Americans were living with HIV, representing 41 percent of all Americans living with the Virus. Of African Americans living with HIV, around 14 percent do not know they are infected. African Americans accounted for an estimated 44 percent of all new HIV infections among adults and adolescents (aged 13 years or older) in 2010, despite representing only 12 percent of the U.S. population. HIV is a sexually transmitted disease or STD; it is also spread through intravenous drug use. HIV infections spread through sharing of needles has declined with needle programs, while the STD rates of infection among African Americans has increased at rate higher than any other ethnic group. Have their HIV status checked--not once but annually. Know the HIV status of sexual partner. If HIV positive: Know how to get on antiviral medication, 2 small pills taken each day, and stay on them. Where to go for information if you or your partner is HIV positive. In 2010, men accounted for 70 percent (14,700) of the estimated 20,900 new HIV infections among all adult and adolescent African Americans. The estimated rate of new HIV infections for African American men (103.6/100,000 population) was 7 times that of white men, twice that of Latino men, and nearly 3 times that of African American women. In 2010, African American gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men represented an estimated 72 percent (10,600) of new infections among all African American men and 36 percent of an estimated 29,800 new HIV infections among all gay and bisexual men. Of those gay and bisexual men, 39 percent (4,321) were young men aged 13 to 24. According to the CDC, the numbers of new HIV diagnoses among African American women fell 42 percent between 2005 to 2014, but it is still high compared to women of other races/ethnicities. Most new HIV infections among African American women (87 percent; 5,300) are attributed to heterosexual contact. In 2012, there were 72,010 Texans living with HIV/AIDS. Texas has the 10th highest number of HIV diagnoses in 2013 and ranks 18th for deaths from HIV. Currently 14 percent of the people living with HIV are undiagnosed and only 30 percent of the people with HIV are virally suppressed, which means that 70 percent of the people who are ill are not on medication that can help limit their ability to infect others. HIV is an unnecessarily disproportionate burden on the African American and Latino community. There is a wall of misinformation about the illness and an uncomfortable silence regarding the need to speak about the illness not only to the young, but also the older persons. When treatments were first developed in the 1990s they had lots of side effects that made patients very ill. Few talk about the advances in HIV treatment that now involve taking 2 small pills a day with the result leaving patients feeling healthy and able to engage in life's normal activities. The virus count for those who take their medication is so low that it often does not register in tests. This does not mean that people are cured, but it does mean that there is no reason not to get tested so that you know if you are in need of treatment. Anyone can become infected--so it is up to all of us to educate our families, neighbors, co-workers and friends about getting tested. There are some insurance company practices that have a detrimental impact on the ability of people with HIV to enroll in qualified health insurance plans. In states like Texas that are not fully participating in the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid [[Page H3743]] expansion this is especially problematic for HIV patients who are poor. Some states allow insurance carriers to post misleading or intentionally vague formularies on market place websites or excluding essential HIV medications from drug formularies and impressing high cost sharing. Out of pocket medication cost each month should be capped. Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for reminding us that we should be done with guns like the assault weapons. I thank the gentlewoman for reminding us of the impact that health disparities have on our communities in this Nation. {time} 2030 Madam Speaker, I have two documents that will be entered into the Record. The first document is from Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson. I would like to state for the Record that she was the first nurse to serve in this United States Congress. And the second is a portion of the Special Feature on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities: 30 Years After the Heckler Report. Special Feature on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities: 30 Years After the Heckler Report Introduction The 1985 Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health, released by then Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler, documented significant disparities in the burden of illness and mortality experienced by blacks and other minority groups in the U.S. population compared with whites (41). The report laid out an ambitious agenda, including improving minority access to high-quality health care, expanding health promotion and health education outreach activities, increasing the number of minority health care providers, and enhancing federal and state data collection activities to better report on minority health issues. In the 30 years since the Heckler Report, national efforts to improve minority health through outreach, programming, and monitoring have included the formation of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Minority Health in 1986 (42); the annual National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports first issued in 2003 (43); the adoption of disparities elimination as an overarching goal of Healthy People 2010 (44); and most recently, an HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities--a comprehensive federal commitment to reduce and eventually eliminate disparities in health and health care (45). Race is a social construct influenced by a complex set of factors (46,47). Because of the complexity and difficulty in conceptualizing and defining race, as well as the increasing representation of racial and ethnic subgroups in the United States, racial classification and data collection systems continue to evolve and expand. In 1977, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) required that all federal data collection efforts collect data on a minimum of four race groups (American Indian or Alaskan Native, black, Asian or Pacific Islander, and white) and did not allow the reporting of more than one race (48). In 1997, in response to growing interest in more detailed reporting on race and ethnicity, OMB mandated data collection for a minimum of five race groups, splitting Asian or Pacific Islander into two categories (Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) (49). In addition, the 1997 standards allowed respondents to report more than one race. A minimum of two categories for data collection on ethnicity, ``Hispanic or Latino'' and ``Not Hispanic or Latino,'' were also required under the 1997 OMB standards. Consequently, whereas the Heckler Report primarily documented black-white differences in health and mortality due to data limitations, this Special Feature is able to report on more detailed racial and ethnic groups. For example, Figures 19-21 display trends in infant mortality and low-risk cesarean section deliveries, and the current data on preterm births for five Hispanic-origin groups. At the time of the Heckler Report, 22.3% of the population were considered racial or ethnic minorities (Table 1). Current Census (2014) estimates identify 37.9% of the population as racial or ethnic minorities (50). In 2014, Hispanic persons, who may be of any race, comprised 17.4% of the U.S. population. Non-Hispanic multiple race persons were 2.0% of the population. For the single race groups, non- Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons were 0.7%, non-Hispanic Asian persons were 5.3%, non-Hispanic black persons were 12.4%, non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander persons were 0.2%, and non-Hispanic white persons were 62.1% of the U.S. population in 2014 (50). Understanding the demographic and socioeconomic composition of U.S. racial and ethnic groups is important because these characteristics are associated with health risk factors, disease prevalence, and access to care, which in turn drive health care utilization and expenditures. Non-Hispanic white persons are, on average, older than those in other racial and ethnic groups, with a median age of 43.1 years, and Hispanic individuals are the youngest, with a median age of 28.5 years in 2014 (50). About one-quarter of black only persons (26.2%) and Hispanic persons (23.6%) lived in poverty compared with 10.1% of non-Hispanic white only persons and 12.0% of Asian only persons in 2014 (51). Non-Hispanic black only children and Hispanic children were particularly likely to live in poverty (37.3% and 31.9%, respectively, in 2014) (52). However, Hispanic individuals are often found to have quite favorable health and mortality patterns in comparison with non-Hispanic white persons and particularly with non-Hispanic black persons, despite having a disadvantaged socioeconomic profile--a pattern termed the epidemiologic paradox (53). HHS defines a racial or ethnic health disparity as ``a particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage. Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group'' (54). There are many different ways to measure racial and ethnic differences in health and mortality, which can lead to different conclusions (55-58). This Special Feature on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (Special Feature) uses the maximal rate difference, one of three overall measures used in Healthy People 2020 to measure differences among groups of people (see Technical Notes). The maximal rate difference is an overall measure of health disparities calculated as the absolute difference between the highest and lowest group rates in the population for a given characteristic (59). The identification of groups that experience the highest and lowest rates in this Special Feature was based on observed rates and was not tested for a statistically significant difference against other rates. Ties in highest or lowest rates were resolved by examining decimal places. With respect to changes in health disparities over time, tracking the maximal rate difference over time enables one to determine whether the absolute difference between the highest and lowest group rates is increasing, decreasing, or stable. The Special Feature charts that follow provide detailed comparisons of key measures of mortality, natality, health conditions, health behaviors, and health care access and utilization, by race, race and ethnicity, or by detailed Hispanic origin, depending on data availability. A majority of the 10 graphs in this year's Special Feature present trends in health from 1999-2014. Results indicate that trends in health were generally positive for the overall population and several graphs illustrate success in narrowing gaps in health by racial and ethnic group. Differences in life expectancy, infant mortality, cigarette smoking among women, influenza vaccinations among those aged 65 and over, and health insurance coverage narrowed among the racial and ethnic groups. For example, the absolute difference in infant mortality rates between infants born to non-Hispanic black mothers (highest rate) and infants born to non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander mothers (lowest rate) narrowed between 1999-2014. Differences by racial and ethnic group in the prevalence of high blood pressure and smoking among adult men remained stable throughout the study period, with non- Hispanic black adults more likely to have high blood pressure than adults in other racial and ethnic groups throughout the period, and non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white males more likely to be current smokers than Hispanic and non- Hispanic Asian men. For low-risk cesarean sections, influenza vaccinations among adults aged 18-64, and unmet dental care needs, the gap widened among the racial and ethnic groups between 1999-2014. Despite improvements over time in many of the health measures presented in this Special Feature, disparities by race and ethnicity were found in the most recent year for all 10 measures, indicating that although progress has been made in the 30 years since the Heckler Report, elimination of disparities in health and access to health care has yet to be achieved. Life Expectancy at Birth In 2014, life expectancy was longer for Hispanic men and women than for non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black men and women. Life expectancy is a measure often used to gauge the overall health of a population. Life expectancy at birth represents the average number of years that a group of infants would live if the group were to experience the age- specific death rates present in the year of birth. Differences in life expectancy among various demographic subpopulations, including racial and ethnic groups, may reflect subpopulation differences in a range of factors such as socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and the prevalence of specific risk factors in a particular subpopulation (60,61). During 1980-2014, life expectancy at birth in the United States increased from 70.0 to 76.4 years for males and from 77.4 to 81.2 years for females (Table 15, and data table for Figure 18). During this period, life expectancy at birth for males and females was longest for white persons and shortest for black persons. For both males and females, racial differences in life expectancy at birth narrowed, but persisted during 1980-2014. Life expectancy at birth was 6.9 years longer for white males than for black males in 1980, and this difference narrowed to 4.2 years in 2014. [[Page H3744]] In 1980, life expectancy at birth was 5.6 years longer for white females than for black females, and this difference narrowed to 3.0 years in 2014. In 2014, Hispanic males and females had the longest life expectancy at birth, and non-Hispanic black males and females had the shortest. In 2014, life expectancy at birth was 7.2 years longer for Hispanic males than for non-Hispanic black males and 5.9 years longer for Hispanic females than for non- Hispanic black females. Infant Mortality During 1999-2013, infant mortality rates were highest among infants born to non-Hispanic black women (11.11 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2013). Infant mortality, the death of a baby before his or her first birthday, is an important indicator of the health and wellbeing of a country. It not only measures the risk of infant death but it is used as an indicator of maternal health, community health status, and availability of quality health services and medical technology (62,63). The infant mortality rate in the United States decreased from 7.04 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999 to 6.75 in 2007, and then decreased at a faster rate to 5.96 in 2013. Trends in infant mortality rates during 1999-2013 varied among the five racial and ethnic groups. During 1999-2013, infants born to non-Hispanic black mothers experienced the highest rates of infant mortality (11.11 in 2013) and infants born to non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander mothers experienced the lowest rates (3.90 in 2013). The difference between the highest and lowest infant mortality rates among the five racial and ethnic groups was stable from 1999 to 2006 and then narrowed from 2006 to 2013. The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (non- Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander) infant mortality rates was 9.41 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999, compared with 7.21 in 2013. For infants born to Hispanic mothers, the infant mortality rate remained stable during 1999-2008 (5.71 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999) and then decreased to 5.00 in 2013. During 1999-2013, the infant mortality rate for Hispanic infants varied by the mother's Hispanic-origin group. Throughout this period, infants born to Puerto Rican mothers experienced the highest mortality rates. In all years except 2009, infants born to Cuban mothers and those born to Central and South American mothers experienced the lowest mortality rates at alternate times throughout 1999-2013. The difference between the highest (Puerto Rican) and lowest (Cuban) infant mortality rates among Hispanic-origin groups narrowed from 3.71 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999 to 2.88 in 2013. During 1999-2013, the difference in infant mortality rates was narrower for mothers in the Hispanic- origin groups than for mothers in the five racial and ethnic groups. Preterm Births In 2014, non-Hispanic black mothers had the highest percentage of preterm births of the five racial and ethnic groups, and Puerto Rican mothers had the highest percentage of preterm births of the five Hispanic-origin groups. An infant's gestational age is an important predictor of his or her survival and subsequent health (64-70). Preterm birth prior to 37 weeks gestation affects infant mortality rates and racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality (Figure 19) (71). The degree of prematurity matters--infants born prior to 32 weeks gestation are at greatest risk of death during infancy, with the risk of infant death decreasing as gestational age increases (72). In 2014, 7.7% of singleton births occurred before 37 weeks of gestation; 5.7% at 34-36 weeks; 0.8% at 32-33 weeks gestation; and 1.2% before 32 weeks (data table for Figure 20). In 2014, among the five racial and ethnic groups, non- Hispanic black women had the highest percentage of singleton births before 37 weeks (11.1%) and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander women had the lowest percentage (6.8%). Non- Hispanic black women also had the highest percentage of singleton preterm births at each preterm gestational age. The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander) percentages of singleton preterm births among the five racial and ethnic groups was 4.3 percentage points (before 37 weeks), 2.0 percentage points (34-36 weeks), 0.6 percentage points (32-33 weeks), and 1.7 percentage points (before 32 weeks). Among Hispanic-origin groups in 2014, Puerto Rican mothers had the highest percentage of singleton births before 37 weeks (9.1%) and Cuban mothers had the lowest percentage (7.2%). The difference between the highest (Puerto Rican) and lowest (Cuban) percentages of singleton preterm births among the Hispanic-origin groups was 1.9 percentage points (before 37 weeks) and 1.3 percentage points (34-36 weeks). Central and South American mothers had the lowest percentage of singleton births before 34 weeks. For preterm births before 34 weeks, the difference between the highest (Puerto Rican) and lowest (Central and South American) percentages was 0.2 percentage points (32-33 weeks) and 0.6 percentage points (before 32 weeks). Low-risk Births Delivered by Cesarean Section During 1999-2014 non-Hispanic black mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries among the five racial and ethnic groups (29.9% in 2014); Cuban mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries among the five Hispanic-origin groups (41.49-6 in 2014). Cesarean deliveries comprise approximately one-third of all births in the United States (32.2% in 2014) and can place mothers and infants at increased risk for poor health outcomes (74). Over the past decade, professional medical groups have attempted to reduce low-risk cesarean deliveries defined as cesarean deliveries among full term (37 or more completed weeks of gestation), singleton, vertex (head first) births to women giving birth for the first time (75,76). The percentage of low-risk births that were delivered by cesarean section increased from 19.5% to 26.6% during 1999- 2005, stabilized during 2005-2009, and then decreased to 26.0% in 2014 (data table for Figure 21). Throughout the period 1999-2014, non-Hispanic black mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries (29.9% in 2014) among the five racial and ethnic groups, while non- Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native mothers experienced the lowest percentage (21.5% in 2014). The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native) percentages widened from 4.8 percentage points in 1999 to 8.4 percentage points in 2014. Among Hispanic mothers, the percentage of low-risk births that were delivered by cesarean section increased from 18.7% to 24.6% during 1999-2004, increased at a slower rate from 2004-2009, and then remained stable during 2009-2014 (data table for Figure 21). Throughout the period 1999-2014 Cuban mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries (41.4% in 2014), while Mexican mothers experienced the lowest percentage (24.1% in 2014). Among Hispanic-origin groups, the difference between the highest and lowest percentages of low-risk cesarean deliveries was stable during 1999-2002, widened sharply during 2002-2006, and then narrowed during 2006-2014. The difference between the highest (Cuban) and lowest (Mexican) percentages was 11.7 percentage points in 1999, 21.5 percentage points in 2006, and 17.3 percentage points in 2014. Children and Adolescents With Obesity In 2011-2014 for children and adolescents aged 2-19 years, Hispanic children and adolescents had the highest prevalence of obesity and non-Hispanic Asian children had the lowest prevalence. Childhood obesity is a serious public health challenge in the United States and many other industrialized nations in the world (Figure 8) (19,77,78). Excess body weight in children is associated with excess morbidity in childhood and excess body weight in adulthood (13,14). Obesity among children and adolescents is defined as a body mass index at or above the sex- and age-specific 95th percentile of the CDC growth charts (15). Between 1999-2000 and 2013-2014, the percentage of children and adolescents aged 2-19 with obesity increased from 13.9% to 17.2% (79). However, among youth aged 2-19, the prevalence of obesity did not change from 2003-2004 through 2013-2014 (79). In 2011-2014 for children and adolescents aged 2-19, the percentage with obesity was highest for Hispanic children and adolescents and lowest for non-Hispanic Asian children and adolescents. For those aged 2-19, the difference between the highest (Hispanic) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) percentages was 13.3 percentage points. For children aged 2-5, the percentage with obesity was highest for Hispanic children and lowest for non-Hispanic white children. (The estimate for non-Hispanic Asian children aged 2-5 was not stable and is not shown.) The difference between the highest (Hispanic) and lowest (non-Hispanic white) percentages was 10.4 percentage points for children aged 2-5. For children aged 6-11, the percentage with obesity was highest for Hispanic children and lowest for non-Hispanic Asian children. For children aged 6-11, the difference between the highest (Hispanic) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) percentages was 15.2 percentage points. In 2011-2014 for adolescents aged 12-19, the percentage with obesity was highest for Hispanic adolescents and lowest for non-Hispanic Asian adolescents. The difference between the highest (Hispanic) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) percentages was 13.4 percentage points for adolescents aged 12-19 years. Hypertension In 2011-2014, non-Hispanic black men and women were the most likely to have hypertension compared with adults in the other racial and ethnic groups. Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure, and other health conditions (80,81). In 2011-2014, 84.1% of adults with hypertension were aware of their status, and 76.1% were taking medication to lower their blood pressure (82). Despite improvement in increasing the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension among minority groups remains a challenge (83). Hypertension is defined as reporting taking antihypertensive medication and/or having a measured systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg or a measured diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg. The age-adjusted percentage of adults aged 20 and over with hypertension was stable during 1999-2014 (30.8% in 2013-2014) (data table for Figure 23). During 1999-2014, non-Hispanic black adults had the highest percentage with [[Page H3745]] hypertension among the three racial and ethnic groups (42.7%, age-adjusted in 2013-2014), while with the exception of 1999- 2000, adults of Mexican origin had the lowest percentage with hypertension (28.8%, age-adjusted in 2013-2014). The difference between the highest and lowest age-adjusted percentages of adults with hypertension among the three racial and ethnic groups was stable during 1999-2014; in 2013-2014, the difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (Mexican-origin) percentages was 13.9 percentage points. In 2011-2014, the age-adjusted percentage of adult men and women with hypertension was similar (31.0% and 29.7%, respectively, data table for Figure 23). The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (Hispanic) age-adjusted percentages of men with hypertension among the four racial and ethnic groups was 14.7 percentage points; for women, the difference between the highest (non- Hispanic black) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) was 19.0 percentage points in 2011-2014. Current Cigarette Smoking During 1999-2014, differences in cigarette smoking between racial and ethnic groups were larger for women than for men. Smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year, accounting for about one in five deaths in the United States (84). Smokers are more likely to develop heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Smoking also increases the risk for diabetes, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis, and stillbirth (85). During 1999-2014, the age-adjusted percentage of adults aged 18 and over who were current cigarette smokers decreased from 25.2% to 19.0% for men and from 21.6% to 15.1% for women (data table for Figure 24). Within each of the four racial and ethnic groups, men were more likely to be current cigarette smokers than women. In 2014 for men, the age-adjusted percentage of current cigarette smokers was highest for non-Hispanic black men (22.0%) and lowest for Hispanic men (13.8%). The difference between the highest and lowest age-adjusted percentages of current cigarette smokers among the four racial and ethnic groups remained stable during 1999-2014 because levels for men in all racial and ethnic groups declined similarly during this period. The difference between the highest (non-Hispanic black) and lowest (Hispanic) percentages for men was 8.2 percentage points in 2014. For women, non-Hispanic white women consistently had the highest age-adjusted percentage of current cigarette smokers among the four racial and ethnic groups throughout 1999-2014 (18.3% in 2014), while non-Hispanic Asian women had the lowest age-adjusted percentage (5.1% in 2014). For women, the difference between the highest (non-Hispanic white) and lowest (non-Hispanic Asian) percentages narrowed from 17.5 percentage points in 1999 to 13.2 in 2014. During 1999-2014, racial and ethnic differences in cigarette smoking prevalence were larger for women than for men. Influenza Vaccination During 1999-2014, influenza vaccination was highest for those aged 65 and over and lowest for those aged 18-64, for all racial and ethnic groups. Influenza is a serious illness that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. Influenza vaccination is especially important for people who are at risk of getting seriously ill from influenza, including those with chronic conditions, older adults, and young children. The percentage of adults aged 18-64 who received an influenza vaccination in the past 12 months remained stable during 1999-2006 and then increased to 35.8% in 2014 (data table for Figure 25). This pattern was present for all racial and ethnic groups. Decreases in influenza vaccination coverage in 2005 were related to a vaccine shortage (86). For those aged 18-64, no racial and ethnic group was consistently the most likely to receive influenza vaccination during 1999- 2014. In 2014, non-Hispanic Asian adults had the highest percentage for influenza vaccination receipt (41.3%) and Hispanic adults had the lowest percentage (27.9%). For adults aged 18-64, the difference between the highest and lowest percentages of adults receiving an influenza vaccination among the four racial and ethnic groups widened from 6.9 percentage points in 1999 (non-Hispanic white compared with Hispanic) to 13.4 in 2014 (non-Hispanic Asian compared with Hispanic). For adults aged 65 and over, the percentage who received an influenza vaccination in the past 12 months increased from 65.7% to 70.1% during 1999-2014. During this period, trends in influenza vaccination coverage varied by racial and ethnic group, and no racial and ethnic group was consistently the most or least likely to receive influenza vaccination. In 2014, non-Hispanic Asian adults had the highest percentage for receipt of influenza vaccination (72.7%) and non-Hispanic black adults had the lowest (57.4%). For adults age 65 and over, the difference between the highest (non-Hispanic Asian) and lowest (non-Hispanic black) percentages of older adults receiving an influenza vaccination among the four racial and ethnic groups was stable during 1999-2003 and then narrowed to 15.3 percentage points in 2014. Health Insurance Coverage During 1999 through the first 6 months of 2015 among adults aged 18-64, lack of health insurance coverage was highest among Hispanic adults. Health insurance is a major determinant of access to health care. Children are less likely to be uninsured than adults aged 18-64 because they are more likely to qualify for public coverage, primarily Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (see data table for Figure 26 for estimates for children) (26,87). Passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 (38) authorized states to expand Medicaid eligibility (88) and to establish the health insurance marketplace in 2014. For adults aged 18-64, the percentage without coverage increased from 17.9% to 20.5% during 1999-2013, and then decreased to 12.7% in the first 6 months of 2015 (36). During this period, the trend for lack of coverage varied by racial and ethnic group. During 1999-June 2015, Hispanic adults aged 18-64 had the highest percentage without coverage (27.2% in the first 6 months of 2015), and non-Hispanic white adults aged 18-64 had the lowest, except in the first 6 months of 2015, when non- Hispanic Asian adults had the lowest percentage without coverage. The difference between the highest and lowest percentages of adults aged 18-64 without health insurance among the four racial and ethnic groups narrowed from 1999-June 2015. This difference was 24.9 percentage points in 1999 (Hispanic adults compared with non-Hispanic white adults) and 19.9 percentage points in the first 6 months of 2015 (Hispanic adults compared with non-Hispanic Asian adults). Difficulty Accessing Needed Dental Care Due to Cost During 1999-2014 among adults aged 18-64, nonreceipt of needed dental care due to cost was lowest among non-Hispanic Asian adults. Oral health is integral to general health and wellbeing, and forgoing needed dental health care can have serious health effects (89). In general, fewer adults have dental coverage than medical coverage, and dental coverage tends to be less comprehensive (90-92). In 2012, 44% of dental expenditures among adults aged 18-64 were paid out of pocket, a higher out-of-pocket percentage than for any other type of personal health care expenditure (93). The percentage of adults aged 18-64 who did not receive needed dental care in the past 12 months due to cost increased from 9.3% to 17.3% during 1999-2010, and then decreased to 12.6% in 2014 (data table for Figure 27). During 1999-2014, non-Hispanic Asian adults aged 18-64 had the lowest percentage of not receiving needed dental care due to cost (6.3% in 2014) among the four racial and ethnic groups. No racial and ethnic group consistently had the highest percentage of not receiving needed dental care due to cost during 1999-2014. The difference between the highest and lowest percentages of adults not receiving needed dental care due to cost among the four racial and ethnic groups widened during 1999-2010, and then remained stable from 2010-2014 for those aged 18-64. This difference was 5.9 percentage points in 1999 (non-Hispanic black compared with non-Hispanic Asian) and 9.4 percentage points in 2014 (Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic Asian). Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot tonight. We have heard the call to action by Members. We have heard the relationship to poverty in health disparities, to the socioeconomic conditions of African Americans to health disparities. We have heard the relationship to death by guns to health disparities. We have heard the data and the statistics about the mortality rates from diseases like cardiovascular disease, the leading killer for women and African American women and men. We have heard about the effect of untreated diabetes and how that affects African Americans. The list goes on and on, Madam Speaker. I could tell you whether it is obesity, whether it is stroke--and certainly as a stroke survivor, I understand firsthand the value and the importance of quality, affordable health care--that there are some Federal programs that actually work and bridge the gap. I could say wonderful things about the United States Health and Human Services Office of Minority Affairs that provides data and research and services for us. But before I ask my colleague, Madam Speaker, to say a few words, I ran across something that was said, in my opinion, by one of the most powerful individuals that will go down in current history. And 20 years from now, Madam Speaker, if I were standing here talking about his legacy, health care would be one of them. Let me conclude my part with these brief words that he quoted on April 1 of this year: ``Our Nation was built on an enduring belief that we are all created equal--regardless of the color of our skin or the station into which we were born. From the ambitions we hold for ourselves to the way we take care of our health, this founding premise serves as the guidepost of our national life.'' Yet, to this day, Madam Speaker, minorities continue to experience the [[Page H3746]] healthcare gaps that leave their communities our communities. I will add this to his ending that, Madam Speaker, tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus asks that we recommit to taking action to overcome these disparities. And that person who will leave a great legacy for these words is no other than our President of these United States, President Barack Obama. And now as we begin to close our hour, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries). I could not think of a better colleague, a better coanchor, to come and share with us our call to action. My colleague and classmate, Congressman Jeffries, is a scholar, someone who sits back, listens, and then comes with resolve. He is someone who is no stranger to this process of telling it like it is. He is someone who has spent a lot of time and years with his experience to speak for the individuals of his district. But tonight, Madam Speaker, I asked him to speak for the Congressional Black Caucus. I asked him to close us out on our call for action as we talk about the health disparities in our African American communities. Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio, and our phenomenal anchor for this CBC Special Order hour today and throughout the second session of the 114th Congress. It has been an honor and a privilege to work closely with her. She has done such a phenomenal job, not just on behalf of the people she represents in the great city of Columbus, Ohio, but all throughout the Nation in her various roles, and certainly in her leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus. It is with a heavy heart that I stand on the floor of the House of Representatives today and, with great sadness, acknowledge the pain and the suffering and extend my condolences to those who have suffered this great tragedy in Orlando, Florida, the worst mass shooting in the history of the United States of America. It is a complicated shooting. We understand that it most likely is an act of terror, a hate crime of unspeakable proportions. There are indications that the shooter may have some degree of mental illness and a history of domestic abuse. The shooter appeared to have been, in some measure, on the FBI's radar. But you can add all those things up and there is still something that is missing that we here in Congress have the capacity to deal with, and that is the fact that one individual was able to purchase a weapon of mass destruction--which should be reserved for war, not the hunting of human beings in this great democratic Republic--and inflict death on 49 individuals and maim in ways that are inhumane to more than 50 others. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said: ``In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.'' During the 114th Congress, there have been more than 100 mass shootings. We often come to the floor of the House of Representatives and the Speaker or one of his designees stands at the rostrum and asks us, as Members of the House, to stand in a moment of silence. And then we go on with business as usual, having done nothing about the tremendous gun violence problem that we have in America. The rest of the world is looking around and saying: What are they doing in the United States of America? Five percent of the world's population, 50 percent of the world's guns. It is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns circulating throughout this great land. The FBI and local law enforcement can't tell you where the overwhelming majority of them are because of legislative silence and malpractice. This is an issue, of course, that has great impact on the African American community. Homicides are the leading cause of death through guns of younger African American men. So we in the CBC view it as a public health crisis certainly for our community. I think it is one that all Americans should view as a health crisis for the entire country. But the thing that is also troubling--and we will have time to deal with this tragedy--is hopefully we will be able to take some commonsense steps in the right direction, including making sure that individuals who are on the terrorist watch list can't purchase weapons of mass destruction. How complicated is that to do? But the thing that is striking for many of us in the African American community is that, when you look at some of the leading causes of death--heart disease being number one, and then, of course, diabetes and childhood obesity being problematic, certain forms of cancer, HIV/ AIDS infection--many of these illnesses, these ailments that plague the neighborhoods that I represent in central Brooklyn, in Bedford- Stuyvesant, in East New York, in Ocean Hill-Brownsville, in Canarsie, and in the west end of Coney Island, are preventable, preventable by better exercise, preventable by dealing with some of the environmental racism that many low-income communities of color have been subjected to, resulting in incredibly high rates of asthma and other forms of respiratory illness, preventable by better diet. Senator Booker recently said to many of us--and this has stuck with me--that more African Americans in the United States of America die as a result of drive-throughs, not drive-bys. That is because the diet, the access to healthy food, is limited. The food deserts within which many African Americans, particularly at the lowest socioeconomic level, are forced to reside in are scandalous. So we in the Congressional Black Caucus believe that we have to deal with these issues in a more meaningful, comprehensive fashion. I am thankful that back at home in the west end of Coney Island, Coney Island Cathedral, one of the most important religious institutions in Brooklyn, is actively engaged in a public health campaign to deal with diabetes and heart disease and many of the other ailments that result from a poor diet that exists, a lack of access to healthy food in the Black community. It is a campaign that we want to take across the Nation. We are thankful for the work that has been done by the Congressional Black Caucus and by President Obama through his leadership of the Affordable Care Act. We now know that over 20 million previously uninsured Americans now have access to quality, affordable health care--disproportionately African American. That is a positive step in the right direction. But instead of trying to dismantle this monumental step forward, as House Republicans have attempted to do more than 60 times over the last few years, they have a clinical obsession with a law that has been declared constitutional-- not once, but twice--by the United States Supreme Court. Let's figure out ways to come together as a nation, despite our racial, religious, and ethnic differences, to deal with the disparities that exist in the African American community and beyond. And let us come together as a Congress and as a nation to deal with the scourge of hate, in its most recent form, directed at the LGBT community down in Orlando in such a horrific and invidious fashion. We are better than this. We can do much better here in the United States Congress. The Congressional Black Caucus is here to lead the way on issues, worked in partnership hand in hand with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if they are just willing to meet us some of the way, to deal with the issues of health disparities in the African American community and deal with the scourge of gun violence that takes our young boys and girls in shocking numbers and also impacts people all across the country. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her leadership and for once again yielding to me and anchoring this Special Order in such a phenomenal way. Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Jeffries. Madam Speaker, as we close out tonight, I can't think of a better way to take my last 30 seconds than to speak to you and to speak to America and to ask that we take these last seconds in silence as a call to action to prevent the guns being on the street, as a call to action to reduce the health disparities. But in honor of the families in Orlando, we give them our commitment that we stand with them and that I stand with all of my friends and constituents and supporters who belong to the LGBT community. [[Page H3747]] I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of the special order hour titled ``Bridging the Divide: A Call to Action by the Congressional Black Caucus to Eliminate Racial Health Disparities.'' I would like to thank my colleagues Congressman Hakeem Jeffries and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty for hosting this timely special order. Historically, racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have the highest uninsured rates and are less likely to receive preventive and quality health care. While the Affordable Care Act has helped minorities afford health insurance and access quality care, there is still a need to eliminate existing disparities. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services is currently working to expand access, end racial and ethnic discrimination, perform outreach to underserved communities, improve workforce diversity, and expand data collection and reporting. While this is an ambitious plan, it is one that is extremely necessary. Unfortunately, coverage, access, and outreach may not be the only keys to eliminating disparities. Demographic characteristics contribute heavily to racial and ethnic health status. For example, research shows that privately insured African American and Hispanic adults fare worse than privately insured white adults along measures to access and use of care. Unfortunately, African Americans and Hispanics are less likely to have a regular provider than their white counterparts. The same research also showed that privately insured African Americans and Hispanics had less confidence in their ability to pay for medical costs. Since social determinants like economic stability, education, and environment play such a large role in how we each view and access health care, many of the changes necessary to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities require a much larger plan than just a focus on health-related programs. Reducing disparities in health truly entails addressing racial and ethnic social determinants such as availability of safe housing, affordable food, access to education, job opportunities, community-based resources, public safety, public transportation, and more. Our society must make many changes before we can truly eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities because that also means eliminating disparities in many other sectors. I thank Congressman Jeffries and Congresswoman Beatty for hosting this poignant special order. ____________________",package_114_183.csv,88245,88245,88311,"[congressional record volume 162, number 93 (monday, june 13, 2016)] [house] [pages h3737-h3747] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 bridging the divide: a call to action by the congressional black caucus to eliminate racial health disparities the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from ohio (mrs. beatty) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. general leave mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous materials relevant to the subject matter of this special order. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from ohio? there was no objection. mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, i rise this evening, along with my colleague, congressman hakeem jeffries of the eighth congressional district of new york, for tonight's congressional black caucus special order hour, bridging the divide: a call to action by the congressional black caucus to eliminate racial health disparities. mr. speaker, tonight, the congressional black caucus comes to the house floor to discuss our overarching goal of promoting equality for african americans across the healthcare spectrum. mr. speaker, it is well known that poverty, socioeconomic status, and health disparities are closely linked and latched together. for example, individuals with low incomes tend to have more restricted access to medical care and face greater financial barriers to affordable health care, oftentimes contributing to health disparities. last week, mr. speaker, the house republicans released their conference's poverty plan called a better way. unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, this republican antipoverty proposal isn't a better way, mr. speaker. it isn't even a new way. quite frankly, mr. speaker, it is the wrong way. it uses the same trickle-down, discredited policies that house republicans have put forth in the past. the house republicans' poverty elimination proposal would repeal the affordable care act and undermine affordable, quality health coverage that millions of americans are now enjoying. it would also cut medicaid, the children's health insurance program that we refer to as chip, and it would end the medicare guarantee--programs with proven successes, mr. speaker, in reducing health disparities. so this is, in part, why we are here tonight. we know that health coverage is the first step in securing better healthcare outcomes, and medicaid and chip play a vital role in opening the doorway to the needed health care, especially for our children. as we address the most pressing challenges in achieving health equity and equality for african americans, i want hardworking american families to know that they have voices in congress that aim to protect their safety, invest in their future, and provide affordable health care for all. with the affordable care act, which every member of the congressional black caucus supported when it passed, we have improved access. we have improved affordability and quality of health care. so tonight, mr. speaker, i want to thank president obama for moving the needle forward in helping american families and african american families across this great country and nation to have the financial and health security that comes with health care. [[page h3738]] mr. speaker, we cannot repeal the aca. we must continue to improve and strengthen it, and we will still have more work to do. the congressional black caucus, from its very inception, has long been the voice for bridging the divide on racial healthcare disparities. no, mr. speaker; we have been the voice for standing up for american people, and especially individuals who are african american, against all disparities. we will not only come to this floor tonight. we will continue our fight and we will continue to come to this floor. tonight, you are going to hear a lot of our members weave together our poverty plan. you are going to have members talk about gun violence. you are going to have members talk about all lives matter. if we don't end the gun violence, then we are not going to have a healthy nation. tonight, i want to applaud my good friend and colleague, congresswoman robin kelly of the second district of illinois, chair of our congressional black caucus health braintrust. i want to commend her for her report, the 2015 kelly report on health disparities in america, the official congressional analysis of the state of african americans' health in the united states, and her work on the 40 under 40 leaders in health awards, leaders under 40 who are physicians and medical professionals. and lastly, let me just thank her for her courage and her leadership for recognizing that all lives matter. we cannot come to this house floor and talk about poverty programs and health care and education and about finance if we do not bridge the gap with gun violence. i salute her for no longer standing up until we make a difference. so tonight, we are coming, mr. speaker, with a strong call to action for us to keep this wonderful america healthy. you will hear from congresswoman kelly momentarily. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. butterfield), chairman of the congressional black caucus. he is a chairman who has been a longtime advocate and voice for not only the congressional black caucus, but for his constituents in his congressional district in north carolina. tonight, he speaks for us. tonight, he speaks for the call of action of us to bridge the gap. mr. butterfield. i thank congresswoman beatty for yielding to me this evening. this is such a sad evening for all of us because of the events in orlando. i thank her so very much for having the strength to come to the floor tonight to manage the important topic that we are all so concerned about. i thank congresswoman robin kelly for her incredible work chairing the cbc health braintrust and all the work she does related to health disparities in this country. i thank all of my colleagues for their tireless work. before i begin my remarks, let me just say that i sat on the floor a moment ago and listened to congresswoman corrine brown. it was an incredible 1-minute speech she gave. i want to share in her sentiments this evening and align myself with the pain that she and her constituents are facing in orlando. the mass shootings were absolutely horrific and unthinkable, under any definition. they are just unthinkable. my prayers go out to the families in orlando for their pain and for all that they are having to endure because of these mass shootings. as someone said a few moments ago, a moment of silence is not enough. it is time for this congress to act. it is time for this body, mr. speaker, to have a serious debate about gun violence and to pass legislation that will deprive people the right to own a high-capacity assault weapon and high-caliber bullets and use them to kill innocent people. now is the time. 136 mass shootings have taken place during the first 164 days of this year. it is a sad statistic that we must address. the united states is 5 percent of the world's population, yet we are 31 percent of the mass shootings in the world. it is time to act. let me talk about the topic tonight, very briefly. the congressional black caucus has been committed to advancing access to affordable health care for all americans so that we can eliminate racially based health disparities. that has been our mission for many years. eliminating health disparities means addressing inequities in environmental, social, and economic conditions in all of our communities. by all measurable statistics, from health outcomes to participation in health professions, african americans lag so far behind. for example, more than 40 percent of african americans have high blood pressure--a rate that is one of the highest in the world. african americans are more likely to develop hypertension at a younger age and are at higher risk of stroke, heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and death from heart disease. stroke, mr. speaker, is the third leading cause of death in the united states. african americans are 50 percent more likely to experience a stroke than white americans. that is a fact. according to the federal centers for disease control and prevention, african american children are twice as likely to have asthma as white children, and black children are 10 times more likely than white children to die of complications from asthma. african americans were, on average, 6 years younger than whites when they suffered sudden cardiac arrest. cardiac arrest incidence among african american men was 175 per 100,000; whereas, the incidence for white males was just 84 per 100,000. cardiac arrest in african american women was 90 per 100,000, as opposed to 40 per 100,000 for caucasian women. another illness which disparately impacts the african american community is that of prostate cancer. in june of last year, i introduced the national prostate cancer plan act, a bipartisan bill which seeks to establish the national prostate cancer council on screening, early detection and assessment and monitoring of prostate cancer. prostate cancer impacts one in seven american men and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the u.s., with nearly 30,000 deaths anticipated just this year. african american men are particularly vulnerable, as they are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 2.5 times more likely to die from the disease than their white counterparts. just last week, house republicans released their a better way agenda to address poverty, but that proposal, like others they have released, will not lift americans out of poverty. in some cases, these types of proposals can actually push low-income americans even deeper into poverty, further limiting their access to health care and exacerbating health disparities. so, mr. speaker, it is time for us to continue our efforts to address the health disparities and barriers. that is what the congressional black caucus is advocating the evening. we are going to continue this work until every disparity is removed. mrs. beatty. i thank congressman butterfield for making us aware of 136 mass shootings in 164 days of this year. certainly, that is relevant to tonight's topic, because whether it is death by guns or death by healthcare disparities, there are too many deaths. i think you said it so well when you provided the data and the statistics of african american men and their mortality rates and what is happening to them. and yes, african americans lag behind, and that is why we stand with you bridging the gap and for this call of action. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentlewoman from illinois (ms. kelly) from the second congressional district, my colleague, my confidant, and my friend. she is a champion of expanding health care. she is a champion, mr. speaker, of making sure that we understand that healthcare disparities must end. she is the chair of the powerful and most prestigious congressional black caucus health braintrust. she strives to increase healthcare opportunities for all: for our children, for our senior citizens, and for residents of the underserved communities. it is my honor to ask her to provide some information on today's topic. {time} 2000 ms. kelly of illinois. mr. speaker, i want to thank my colleagues and my classmates, the gentlewoman from ohio (mrs. beatty), my friend, and the distinguished gentleman from new [[page h3739]] york (mr. jeffries), for leading this important conversation about bridging the divide to eliminate racial health disparities. but i can't weigh in on that topic until i first address the horrific events of yesterday in orlando, florida. our nation is horrified and heartbroken by the tragedy in orlando. we are disgusted by this brutal attack. we will not tolerate terrorism or hate in any form against any group of people because this is just not our way. these ideas of hate will not endure because there is not strength to them. we will win the battle against terrorism and intolerance. we will hold leaders accountable who put their nra score ahead of the need to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists. we will stand with the lgbtq community and value their lives, their health, and their security from the threat of violence and hate. and we will work to see that all americans enjoy the very same freedoms and protections. we have done a lot of moments of silence, but i believe in showing respect through action, not silence, and that is why we are here this evening to discuss what divides us as a country in a health sense. for 45 years, the congressional black caucus has been out front in congress in fighting for these freedoms and protections. and when it comes to the matter of health equity, i have worked to champion the health policy concerns of vulnerable communities as my predecessors in the congressional black caucus health braintrust, the honorable louis stokes and dr. christensen, have done. some of my colleagues here know this, but i want to repeat it for anyone who doesn't. before he was killed, martin luther king, jr., was quoted as saying: ``of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' i couldn't agree more, and as the chair of the health braintrust, i have worked with many of the people in this room to focus on advancing this critical phase of the human rights and civil rights struggle: health equity. when benjamin franklin created the nation's first public hospital, the pennsylvania hospital, he did so in order to establish the promotion of public health as a core american value. he did so to care for our nation's diseased and sick poor. nearly 300 years later, the affordable care act cemented health care as a fundamental right for all americans. yet, today, we find ourselves at a crossroads in health care. health disparities in communities of color continue to be intractable hurdles in the quest to achieve health equity in america. african americans are infected with hiv at a rate that is 8 times that of white americans. while white women are more likely to have breast cancer, african american women are 40 percent more likely to die from the disease. african americans, latinos, asians, and pacific islanders, as well as native americans, are diagnosed with lupus two to three times more frequently than caucasians. more than 13 percent of african americans aged 20 or older have diagnosed diabetes. and people of color are two to four times more likely than whites to reach end-stage renal disease. this grim snapshot illustrates that, despite the gains we have made since the days of ben franklin and the aca, there is still much ground to cover in closing the health equity gap. last year, i drafted a comprehensive report, the kelly report on health disparities, an official congressional analysis of the state of minority health in the u.s. that offers a blueprint for reversing negative health trends in communities of color. the kelly report brought members of congress together, medical professionals, and public health thought leaders to examine the root causes and impact of health disparities in america, and provide a comprehensive set of legislative and policy recommendations to address them. the whole can only ever be as healthy as its parts. for america to achieve true health equity, lawmakers, community leaders, and industry stakeholders must come together and aggressively work to reduce disparities nationwide. we all have a part to play in creating a healthier america. we must take heed of dr. king's words: ``of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' and we can and we must fix that. again, because of what happened in orlando, and i want to say it is the mass shooting that we are talking about, and it is tragic, but the night before, one person was shot. and i often liken this to a 747 crash as we talk about that, but we don't talk about the two-seater. and that two-seater, the person that died alone in that club after she sung friday night has a brother, a mother, a father, and their pain is just as harsh. so let's not forget that young lady that lost her life. and she did not lose her life to someone that was muslim or someone that believed in isis. she lost her life to an american young man, a caucasian. mrs. beatty. i thank the gentlewoman from illinois, (ms. kelly). and how appropriate for tonight for the gentlewoman to remind us, as i ask her to constantly do, about why we must, to put it in her words, come together. we must do something. madam speaker, tonight we say to you and to our republican colleagues: come together and do something. i say to the gentlewoman, congresswoman kelly: let today serve as a turning point in our nation's ongoing struggle to stamp out hate of all forms. we must mourn those who lost their family members, but we must do more than mourn. we must have action. if we are going to have a hope for a better america, hate has no place in this great nation. so i thank the gentlewoman, and i will continue to remind others that we know firsthand what it does to our community. but, madam speaker, we stand here tonight speaking to all communities. but here is what we know. the naacp has shared with us that african american children and teens accounted for 45 percent of all child and teen gun deaths in 2008 and 2009, but were only 15 percent of the total child population. the fbi says that approximately 47 percent of victims of the 165,000 homicides from 2000 to 2010, including over 111,000 gun-related homicides, were black. the children's defense fund, madam speaker, says that in 2010, black males between the ages of 15 and 19 were nearly 30 times more likely to die in a gun homicide than white males of the same age, and more than three times more likely to die in a gun homicide than hispanic males of the same age. so, madam speaker, tonight you will hear us repeatedly make a call for action. you will hear us repeatedly quote great leaders. and i think it is worth quoting again what congresswoman kelly said, in the words of dr. martin luther king: ``of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane'' of all inequalities, of all injustices. as we speak of great leaders, it is, indeed, my honor and my privilege to ask my colleague, the gentleman from the 10th congressional district of new jersey (mr. payne), a man who has made a name for himself, a man who understands firsthand as a father of triplets, as a spouse, as a ranking member on homeland security's subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response, and communications, a man who has been at the forefront in his community, a man who served before coming here as an elected official, but, more importantly, a person who understands health disparities and the call for action--it gives me great honor to yield to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. payne) to share some wisdom with us tonight. mr. payne. madam speaker, i first want to start by thanking congresswoman beatty for that very kind and generous introduction. we, in our class, are very proud of our colleagues, and we support each other in times of need. i just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge congressman hakeem jeffries, the gentleman from new york, who is also host of this special order. i appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me. before i begin, i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible [[page h3740]] tragedy in orlando, and i can only imagine what they are going through. the other thing that is illuminating to me is that, as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence, after that moment of silence, i believe members were given a 1-minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor, as is customary, and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando. so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house, but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle. madam speaker, eliminating racial-based health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all. even in the 21st century, health disparities are stark, especially in the african american communities, where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites. today, despite improvement in overall health in the united states, african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas, including access to quality care, timelines of care, and health outcomes. for years, the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities, a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities, such as inequities in environmental, social, and economic conditions in our communities. instead, we get from them proposals like their so-called a better way poverty proposal, a stale, repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty. cutting job training programs, food assistance, and head start will push low-income americans further into poverty, making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their well-being and the well-being of their families. we need to, instead, use the government as a source of good. every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment. yet, low-income and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution, resulting in serious health problems such as asthma, heart problems, and cancer. this is a very real problem across america, a very real problem in my district. thirteen million people, including 3.5 million children, are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution. {time} 2015 my district is home to the port newark-elizabeth marine terminal, part of the port of new york and new jersey, the third largest port in the country. according to the epa, 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthma--three times the state average. what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system. the issue is critical to the low-income and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards. now, since i am on the topic of environmental justice, i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint, including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental. their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families, and, i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities. the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable. it is to address the environmental, social, and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities. it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes. it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations. in closing, madam speaker, i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racial-based health disparities. african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor provider-patient communication and health literacy issues. consequently, they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions. we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find, understand, and use the information and services. as co-chair of the congressional men's health caucus, i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and well-being. so i encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions, to get the security you and your family deserve, and to get the health care that we all need. mrs. beatty. i thank congressman payne so much for giving us such compelling information and data and reminding us that the time is now for us to enact those programs that work, and the time is now for us to understand what is at risk. also, let me thank the gentleman for his role on the congressional men's health caucus. at this time, i yield to the gentlewoman from the state of texas (ms. jackson lee). the gentlewoman from the 18th congressional district of texas is someone who i am always amazed when she comes to the mic, someone who is well researched, and someone who delivers an oratorical message that makes us take pause and pay attention. tonight, i would like to say that congresswoman sheila jackson lee is a movement. earlier, i heard her use that word in talk about how we, madam speaker, must be the movement against violence, that we must be leading that movement against these disparities in health care. ms. jackson lee. madam speaker, there is no doubt how much i appreciate the congressional black caucus and congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries for always being timely in allowing us to give a message to our colleagues. we hope maybe the american people will hear us, but we accept that this body is the body to which and to whom we speak. so i am thankful for that. i want to pay tribute, overall, to the congressional black caucus because we are actually here speaking of health disparities, because it was the caucus that triggered this debate through the years that we have been trying to get universal access to health care and was the moving force in the 2009, 2008, and 2010 passage, ultimately, of the affordable care act, where the work that we did, joining congresswoman donna christian-christiansen, at that time, and frank pallone on the congressional health caucus, but on the cbc we had the health disparities task to ensure that the language in the affordable care act addressed the issue of health disparities. there was a large section on that that built on some of the work that some of us had already done creating the office of minority health that i had worked on in years past. so it was the lightning bolt of the caucus, and then working with the congressional asian pacific american caucus and then the congressional hispanic caucus that we raised the issue that no one was talking about. i remember debating on the floor of the house on the issues of dealing with senior citizen african american men and how they access health care, how do women access health care, and how do women impacted by diabetes access health care. these are some of the diseases that have a proclivity to the african american population. we were finding out that we even had an issue where medical professionals didn't know how to ask the questions. how do you address someone who needs to be diagnosed for prostate cancer or may be diagnosed for prostate cancer and is an african american male, a senior citizen? my father ultimately died from cancer that metastasized from the prostate to the lungs and the brain, so we knew we had a serious issue. [[page h3741]] so today, i want to mention four points, but i am going to focus on the last one, obesity--a question of access to health care and physical fitness. many times we live in areas where there is no access to a pool or a tennis court. mental health--if you lived your life in a segregated america, if you were called ``boy'' and ``girl,'' it is a different mental health situation than maybe others may have faced. if you live in a situation of poverty, of a single household, maybe--this is not across the board--these issues will be impacted. if you lived around gun violence, if you saw your 15-year-old friend being shot dead in the street, there is a question of mental health that we need access to that care for us to be able to reach out or maybe counselors to be able to provide for children. hiv/aids is something that we have lived through. i remember going to funerals of friends in the 1980s and into the 1990s, particularly with hiv/aids. so we have worked in the congressional black caucus to massively talk about testing. let me get to this point that i want to dwell just for a moment on, and that is gun violence. i was here on the floor earlier with my head held down and my heart heavy as my district, today, had a memorial. they had one yesterday. we will have one tomorrow and have one on wednesday. i mourn with congresswoman corinne brown of florida. we are offering legislation dealing with the assault weapons and to complement legislation already passed or already in place. but it is important to note that this is a health issue, because the centers for disease control can assess and study every health issue that faces america today, but they are legislatively, by law, prohibited by my friends on other side of the aisle, by republicans, disallowed every year to give them permission to study gun violence. gun violence is killing our children and killing our families. in orlando, it killed latinos who happened to be the attendees at the pulse club. the lgbtq community was the dominant community, and a hateful terroristic act using ar-15s and glock guns killed them. the incident was the deadliest mass shooting. the next deadliest incidents in recent history were april 16, 2007, virginia tech, 32 killed, 17 injured; december 14, 2012, sandy hook, 26 killed, 1 injured; october 16, 1991, killeen, texas, 23 killed, 27 injured. according to everytown index of mass shootings where four or more people are shot and killed, the incident was the ninth mass shooting in the united states in 2016, and the 150th mass shooting in united states since january 1, 2009. the mass shooting with guns impacts both the mental health, the sanctity, and the minority community. it is shameful that we are not allowed to engage in the kind of research that a harvard professor talked about, and that is the assessing of violence and the assessing of violence with guns. the materials i have before me make it very clear that most of these violent acts are done with guns--done with guns. san bernardino, chattanooga, charleston, garland, oak creek, and fort hood were all done with guns. so i stand here today to challenge this issue of health disparities to say that the heavy brunt of killings, singular killings, are impacted by poverty, lack of access to health care, the proliferation of guns in our inner city communities, and the failure of the united states congress to put real gun safety legislation, closing the loophole, the jim clyburn rule that says that, if you don't get the review and approval by atf, you do not get the gun. you have to wait until you get the approval from atf, which may be trying to determine whether this person with multiple problems, mental health or background issues, doesn't need to get a gun and then ultimately go kill their spouse, their children, their neighbors, their family members or strangers. so it is my belief today that this health disparities debate is crucial, and we should come away from here recognizing that obesity, the issues of mental health and hiv/aids can be, with great investment, researched for cures, or cancer that proliferates in our community, triple negative breast cancer, legislation that i have put forward and have gotten passed about that impact. but it is the gun violence that we are doing absolutely nothing about. the disparities and the impact on minority communities is atrocious. i want to close simply by saying the word or the acronym lgbtq community. i want to say it over and over again, because i think it is shameful that, in our debate, in our recognition of the tragedy of orlando, that we don't acknowledge the horrific hate crime and the hatefulness against that community. as i stand here, that community is diverse, and there are african americans who are lgbtq. so i would ask that, as we move forward this week, we will be reminded of this hatefulness and we will have a cure. we will be reminded of this violence, and we will have a cure. that cure, first of all, will be to restrain the use of assault weapons and these weapons of war-type bullets that men and women in the united states military say have no business on the streets of america. i believe, congresswoman, that health disparities are an important wall and division to overcome. i thank the gentlewoman for having this special order to ensure that we will confront these issues and try to save lives. racial disparities refer to the variation in rates of disease occurrence and disabilities between socioeconomic and/or geographically defined population groups. i want to focus on four areas of racial disparities in health that impact african americans that we can do something about: 1. obesity; 2. mental health; 3. hiv/aids; and 4. gun violence. african americans, based on 2015 census data, comprise 13.2 percent of the u.s. population, or about 42 million people. socioeconomic status, in turn, is linked to mental health: people who are impoverished, homeless, incarcerated or have substance abuse problems are at higher risk for poor mental health. as the founder and chair of the congressional children's caucus, i am especially concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic among african-american youth. more than 40 percent of african american teenagers are overweight, and nearly 25 percent are obese. the percentage of children aged 6-11 years in the united states who were obese increased from 7 percent in 1980 to nearly 18 percent in 2012. african american youth are consuming less nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables and are not getting enough physical exercise. this combination has led to an epidemic of obesity, which directly contributes to numerous deadly or life-threatening diseases or conditions, including the following: hypertension; dyslipidemia (high cholesterol or high triglyceride levels); type 2 diabetes; coronary heart disease; stroke; gallbladder disease; osteoarthritis; asthma, bronchitis, sleep apnea, and other respiratory problems; cancer (breast, colon, and endometrial). when ethnicity and income are considered, the picture is even more troubling. african american youngsters from low-income families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higher-income families. efforts such as the let's move! campaign by the first lady are pivotal to ensuring that communities are able to provide healthy snacks and food and encourage healthier decisions. since the mid-1970s, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children. non-hispanic blacks have the highest age-adjusted rates of obesity at 47.8 percent. according to the cdc, 37.6 percent of men and 56.9 percent of women twenty years and over are obese. every year, more than 40 million americans struggle with mental illness. african american men are as likely as anyone else to have mental illness, but they are less likely to get help. racism continues to have an impact on the mental health of african americans. negative stereotypes and attitudes of rejection have decreased, but continue to occur with measurable, adverse consequences. historical and contemporary instances of negative treatment have led to a mistrust of authorities, many of whom are not seen as having the best interests of african americans in mind. according to the department of health and human services office of minority health: adult blacks are 20 percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than adult whites. adult blacks living below poverty are two to three times more likely to report serious psychological distress than those living above poverty. adult blacks are more likely to have feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness than are adult whites. how african americans view mental health over generations is a major barrier to accessing mental health services and treatment. [[page h3742]] in 1996, mha commissioned a national survey on clinical depression. the survey explored the barriers preventing americans seeking treatment and gauged overall knowledge of and attitudes toward depression. this survey revealed that: 63 percent of african americans believe that depression is a personal weakness. this is significantly higher than the overall survey average of 54 percent. only 31 percent of african americans believed that depression was a ``health problem.'' african americans were more likely to believe that depression was ``normal'' than the overall survey average. 56 percent believed that depression was a normal part of aging. 45 percent believed it was normal for a mother to feel depressed for at least two weeks after giving birth. 40 percent believed it was normal for a husband or wife to feel depressed for more than a year after the death of a spouse. many of these problems persist to this day. as doctor william lawson of howard university (and mha's district of columbia affiliate) pointed out in an npr interview in 2012, ``many african-americans have a lot of negative feelings about, or not even aware of mental health services. the ``mental health: culture, race and ethnicity supplement'' to the 1999 u.s. surgeon general's report on mental health, states the following: african-american physicians are five times more likely than white physicians to treat african-american patients. african-american patients who see african-american physicians rate their physicians' styles of interaction as more participatory. african americans seeking help for a mental health problem would have trouble finding african american mental health professionals: in 1998, only 2 percent of psychiatrists, 2 percent of psychologists and 4 percent of social workers said they were african americans. the public mental health safety net of hospitals, community health centers, and local health departments are vital to many african americans, especially to those in high-need populations. african americans of all ages are underrepresented in outpatient treatment but over-represented in inpatient treatment. few african-american children receive treatment in privately funded psychiatric hospitals, but many receive treatment in publicly funded residential treatment centers for emotionally disturbed youth. in 2012, there were an estimated 356,268 inmates with severe mental illnesses in u.s. prisons and jails. there were only 35,000 mentally ill individuals in state psychiatric hospitals. the report, ``the treatment of persons with mental illness in prisons and jails,'' jails ``in 44 of the 50 states and the district of columbia, a prison or jail in that state holds more individuals with serious mental illness than the largest remaining state psychiatric hospital.'' the report said. african americans today are overrepresented in our jails and prisons. people of color account for 60 percent of the prison population. the stanford law school three strikes project's report stated that, ``over the past 15 years, the number of mentally ill people in prison in california has almost doubled.'' in california, 45 percent of state prison inmates have been treated for severe mental illness within the past year. african americans also account for 14 percent of regular drug users, but for 37 percent of drug arrests. illicit drug use is frequently associated with self-medication among people with mental illnesses. in january 2014, the texas observer reported that, of the 9,000 inmates in harris county jail more than 25 percent take medication for mental illness, which means that the jail treats more psychiatric patients than all 10 of texas' state-run public mental hospitals combined. the passage of the affordable care act created access to health care for those who purchase health insurance and for the poor living in states that are participating in the medicaid component of the aca. disparities can occur, if physicians do not refer patients with signs of mental illness for proper treatment or if referred patients do not seek out treatment. disparities in access to care and treatment for mental illnesses have also persisted over time. as noted by the office of minority health: only 8.7 percent of adult blacks, versus 16 percent of adult whites, received treatment for mental health concerns in 2007-2008. only 6.2 percent of adult blacks, versus 13.9 percent of adult whites, received medications for mental health concerns during 2008. while 68.7 percent of adult whites with a major depressive episode in 2009 received treatment, only 53.2 percent of adult blacks did. the affordable care act will have an impact on this gap by 2016. depression and other mental illness can be deadly if left untreated. suicide is the third leading cause of death among african americans 15 to 24 years old. untreated mental illness can also make african american men more vulnerable to substance abuse, homelessness, incarceration, and homicide. african americas are the racial/ethnic group most affected by hiv in the united states. according to the cdc, 44 percent (19,540) of estimated new hiv diagnoses in the united states were among african americans, who comprise 12 percent of the us population. hiv/aids are now the leading cause of death among african americans ages 25 to 44--ahead of heart disease, accidents, cancer, and homicide. at the end of 2012, an estimated 496,500 african americans were living with hiv, representing 41 percent of all americans living with the virus. of african americans living with hiv, around 14 percent do not know they are infected. african americans accounted for an estimated 44 percent of all new hiv infections among adults and adolescents (aged 13 years or older) in 2010, despite representing only 12 percent of the u.s. population. hiv is a sexually transmitted disease or std; it is also spread through intravenous drug use. hiv infections spread through sharing of needles has declined with needle programs, while the std rates of infection among african americans has increased at rate higher than any other ethnic group. have their hiv status checked--not once but annually. know the hiv status of sexual partner. if hiv positive: know how to get on antiviral medication, 2 small pills taken each day, and stay on them. where to go for information if you or your partner is hiv positive. in 2010, men accounted for 70 percent (14,700) of the estimated 20,900 new hiv infections among all adult and adolescent african americans. the estimated rate of new hiv infections for african american men (103.6/100,000 population) was 7 times that of white men, twice that of latino men, and nearly 3 times that of african american women. in 2010, african american gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men represented an estimated 72 percent (10,600) of new infections among all african american men and 36 percent of an estimated 29,800 new hiv infections among all gay and bisexual men. of those gay and bisexual men, 39 percent (4,321) were young men aged 13 to 24. according to the cdc, the numbers of new hiv diagnoses among african american women fell 42 percent between 2005 to 2014, but it is still high compared to women of other races/ethnicities. most new hiv infections among african american women (87 percent; 5,300) are attributed to heterosexual contact. in 2012, there were 72,010 texans living with hiv/aids. texas has the 10th highest number of hiv diagnoses in 2013 and ranks 18th for deaths from hiv. currently 14 percent of the people living with hiv are undiagnosed and only 30 percent of the people with hiv are virally suppressed, which means that 70 percent of the people who are ill are not on medication that can help limit their ability to infect others. hiv is an unnecessarily disproportionate burden on the african american and latino community. there is a wall of misinformation about the illness and an uncomfortable silence regarding the need to speak about the illness not only to the young, but also the older persons. when treatments were first developed in the 1990s they had lots of side effects that made patients very ill. few talk about the advances in hiv treatment that now involve taking 2 small pills a day with the result leaving patients feeling healthy and able to engage in life's normal activities. the virus count for those who take their medication is so low that it often does not register in tests. this does not mean that people are cured, but it does mean that there is no reason not to get tested so that you know if you are in need of treatment. anyone can become infected--so it is up to all of us to educate our families, neighbors, co-workers and friends about getting tested. there are some insurance company practices that have a detrimental impact on the ability of people with hiv to enroll in qualified health insurance plans. in states like texas that are not fully participating in the affordable care act's medicaid [[page h3743]] expansion this is especially problematic for hiv patients who are poor. some states allow insurance carriers to post misleading or intentionally vague formularies on market place websites or excluding essential hiv medications from drug formularies and impressing high cost sharing. out of pocket medication cost each month should be capped. mrs. beatty. madam speaker, i thank congresswoman sheila jackson lee for reminding us that we should be done with guns like the assault weapons. i thank the gentlewoman for reminding us of the impact that health disparities have on our communities in this nation. {time} 2030 madam speaker, i have two documents that will be entered into the record. the first document is from congresswoman eddie bernice johnson. i would like to state for the record that she was the first nurse to serve in this united states congress. and the second is a portion of the special feature on racial and ethnic health disparities: 30 years after the heckler report. special feature on racial and ethnic health disparities: 30 years after the heckler report introduction the 1985 report of the secretary's task force on black and minority health, released by then secretary of health and human services margaret heckler, documented significant disparities in the burden of illness and mortality experienced by blacks and other minority groups in the u.s. population compared with whites (41). the report laid out an ambitious agenda, including improving minority access to high-quality health care, expanding health promotion and health education outreach activities, increasing the number of minority health care providers, and enhancing federal and state data collection activities to better report on minority health issues. in the 30 years since the heckler report, national efforts to improve minority health through outreach, programming, and monitoring have included the formation of the department of health and human services (hhs) office of minority health in 1986 (42); the annual national healthcare quality and disparities reports first issued in 2003 (43); the adoption of disparities elimination as an overarching goal of healthy people 2010 (44); and most recently, an hhs action plan to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities--a comprehensive federal commitment to reduce and eventually eliminate disparities in health and health care (45). race is a social construct influenced by a complex set of factors (46,47). because of the complexity and difficulty in conceptualizing and defining race, as well as the increasing representation of racial and ethnic subgroups in the united states, racial classification and data collection systems continue to evolve and expand. in 1977, the office of management and budget (omb) required that all federal data collection efforts collect data on a minimum of four race groups (american indian or alaskan native, black, asian or pacific islander, and white) and did not allow the reporting of more than one race (48). in 1997, in response to growing interest in more detailed reporting on race and ethnicity, omb mandated data collection for a minimum of five race groups, splitting asian or pacific islander into two categories (asian, and native hawaiian or other pacific islander) (49). in addition, the 1997 standards allowed respondents to report more than one race. a minimum of two categories for data collection on ethnicity, ``hispanic or latino'' and ``not hispanic or latino,'' were also required under the 1997 omb standards. consequently, whereas the heckler report primarily documented black-white differences in health and mortality due to data limitations, this special feature is able to report on more detailed racial and ethnic groups. for example, figures 19-21 display trends in infant mortality and low-risk cesarean section deliveries, and the current data on preterm births for five hispanic-origin groups. at the time of the heckler report, 22.3% of the population were considered racial or ethnic minorities (table 1). current census (2014) estimates identify 37.9% of the population as racial or ethnic minorities (50). in 2014, hispanic persons, who may be of any race, comprised 17.4% of the u.s. population. non-hispanic multiple race persons were 2.0% of the population. for the single race groups, non- hispanic american indian or alaska native persons were 0.7%, non-hispanic asian persons were 5.3%, non-hispanic black persons were 12.4%, non-hispanic native hawaiian or other pacific islander persons were 0.2%, and non-hispanic white persons were 62.1% of the u.s. population in 2014 (50). understanding the demographic and socioeconomic composition of u.s. racial and ethnic groups is important because these characteristics are associated with health risk factors, disease prevalence, and access to care, which in turn drive health care utilization and expenditures. non-hispanic white persons are, on average, older than those in other racial and ethnic groups, with a median age of 43.1 years, and hispanic individuals are the youngest, with a median age of 28.5 years in 2014 (50). about one-quarter of black only persons (26.2%) and hispanic persons (23.6%) lived in poverty compared with 10.1% of non-hispanic white only persons and 12.0% of asian only persons in 2014 (51). non-hispanic black only children and hispanic children were particularly likely to live in poverty (37.3% and 31.9%, respectively, in 2014) (52). however, hispanic individuals are often found to have quite favorable health and mortality patterns in comparison with non-hispanic white persons and particularly with non-hispanic black persons, despite having a disadvantaged socioeconomic profile--a pattern termed the epidemiologic paradox (53). hhs defines a racial or ethnic health disparity as ``a particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage. health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group'' (54). there are many different ways to measure racial and ethnic differences in health and mortality, which can lead to different conclusions (55-58). this special feature on racial and ethnic health disparities (special feature) uses the maximal rate difference, one of three overall measures used in healthy people 2020 to measure differences among groups of people (see technical notes). the maximal rate difference is an overall measure of health disparities calculated as the absolute difference between the highest and lowest group rates in the population for a given characteristic (59). the identification of groups that experience the highest and lowest rates in this special feature was based on observed rates and was not tested for a statistically significant difference against other rates. ties in highest or lowest rates were resolved by examining decimal places. with respect to changes in health disparities over time, tracking the maximal rate difference over time enables one to determine whether the absolute difference between the highest and lowest group rates is increasing, decreasing, or stable. the special feature charts that follow provide detailed comparisons of key measures of mortality, natality, health conditions, health behaviors, and health care access and utilization, by race, race and ethnicity, or by detailed hispanic origin, depending on data availability. a majority of the 10 graphs in this year's special feature present trends in health from 1999-2014. results indicate that trends in health were generally positive for the overall population and several graphs illustrate success in narrowing gaps in health by racial and ethnic group. differences in life expectancy, infant mortality, cigarette smoking among women, influenza vaccinations among those aged 65 and over, and health insurance coverage narrowed among the racial and ethnic groups. for example, the absolute difference in infant mortality rates between infants born to non-hispanic black mothers (highest rate) and infants born to non-hispanic asian or pacific islander mothers (lowest rate) narrowed between 1999-2014. differences by racial and ethnic group in the prevalence of high blood pressure and smoking among adult men remained stable throughout the study period, with non- hispanic black adults more likely to have high blood pressure than adults in other racial and ethnic groups throughout the period, and non-hispanic black and non-hispanic white males more likely to be current smokers than hispanic and non- hispanic asian men. for low-risk cesarean sections, influenza vaccinations among adults aged 18-64, and unmet dental care needs, the gap widened among the racial and ethnic groups between 1999-2014. despite improvements over time in many of the health measures presented in this special feature, disparities by race and ethnicity were found in the most recent year for all 10 measures, indicating that although progress has been made in the 30 years since the heckler report, elimination of disparities in health and access to health care has yet to be achieved. life expectancy at birth in 2014, life expectancy was longer for hispanic men and women than for non-hispanic white or non-hispanic black men and women. life expectancy is a measure often used to gauge the overall health of a population. life expectancy at birth represents the average number of years that a group of infants would live if the group were to experience the age- specific death rates present in the year of birth. differences in life expectancy among various demographic subpopulations, including racial and ethnic groups, may reflect subpopulation differences in a range of factors such as socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and the prevalence of specific risk factors in a particular subpopulation (60,61). during 1980-2014, life expectancy at birth in the united states increased from 70.0 to 76.4 years for males and from 77.4 to 81.2 years for females (table 15, and data table for figure 18). during this period, life expectancy at birth for males and females was longest for white persons and shortest for black persons. for both males and females, racial differences in life expectancy at birth narrowed, but persisted during 1980-2014. life expectancy at birth was 6.9 years longer for white males than for black males in 1980, and this difference narrowed to 4.2 years in 2014. [[page h3744]] in 1980, life expectancy at birth was 5.6 years longer for white females than for black females, and this difference narrowed to 3.0 years in 2014. in 2014, hispanic males and females had the longest life expectancy at birth, and non-hispanic black males and females had the shortest. in 2014, life expectancy at birth was 7.2 years longer for hispanic males than for non-hispanic black males and 5.9 years longer for hispanic females than for non- hispanic black females. infant mortality during 1999-2013, infant mortality rates were highest among infants born to non-hispanic black women (11.11 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2013). infant mortality, the death of a baby before his or her first birthday, is an important indicator of the health and wellbeing of a country. it not only measures the risk of infant death but it is used as an indicator of maternal health, community health status, and availability of quality health services and medical technology (62,63). the infant mortality rate in the united states decreased from 7.04 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999 to 6.75 in 2007, and then decreased at a faster rate to 5.96 in 2013. trends in infant mortality rates during 1999-2013 varied among the five racial and ethnic groups. during 1999-2013, infants born to non-hispanic black mothers experienced the highest rates of infant mortality (11.11 in 2013) and infants born to non-hispanic asian or pacific islander mothers experienced the lowest rates (3.90 in 2013). the difference between the highest and lowest infant mortality rates among the five racial and ethnic groups was stable from 1999 to 2006 and then narrowed from 2006 to 2013. the difference between the highest (non-hispanic black) and lowest (non- hispanic asian or pacific islander) infant mortality rates was 9.41 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999, compared with 7.21 in 2013. for infants born to hispanic mothers, the infant mortality rate remained stable during 1999-2008 (5.71 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999) and then decreased to 5.00 in 2013. during 1999-2013, the infant mortality rate for hispanic infants varied by the mother's hispanic-origin group. throughout this period, infants born to puerto rican mothers experienced the highest mortality rates. in all years except 2009, infants born to cuban mothers and those born to central and south american mothers experienced the lowest mortality rates at alternate times throughout 1999-2013. the difference between the highest (puerto rican) and lowest (cuban) infant mortality rates among hispanic-origin groups narrowed from 3.71 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999 to 2.88 in 2013. during 1999-2013, the difference in infant mortality rates was narrower for mothers in the hispanic- origin groups than for mothers in the five racial and ethnic groups. preterm births in 2014, non-hispanic black mothers had the highest percentage of preterm births of the five racial and ethnic groups, and puerto rican mothers had the highest percentage of preterm births of the five hispanic-origin groups. an infant's gestational age is an important predictor of his or her survival and subsequent health (64-70). preterm birth prior to 37 weeks gestation affects infant mortality rates and racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality (figure 19) (71). the degree of prematurity matters--infants born prior to 32 weeks gestation are at greatest risk of death during infancy, with the risk of infant death decreasing as gestational age increases (72). in 2014, 7.7% of singleton births occurred before 37 weeks of gestation; 5.7% at 34-36 weeks; 0.8% at 32-33 weeks gestation; and 1.2% before 32 weeks (data table for figure 20). in 2014, among the five racial and ethnic groups, non- hispanic black women had the highest percentage of singleton births before 37 weeks (11.1%) and non-hispanic asian or pacific islander women had the lowest percentage (6.8%). non- hispanic black women also had the highest percentage of singleton preterm births at each preterm gestational age. the difference between the highest (non-hispanic black) and lowest (non-hispanic asian or pacific islander) percentages of singleton preterm births among the five racial and ethnic groups was 4.3 percentage points (before 37 weeks), 2.0 percentage points (34-36 weeks), 0.6 percentage points (32-33 weeks), and 1.7 percentage points (before 32 weeks). among hispanic-origin groups in 2014, puerto rican mothers had the highest percentage of singleton births before 37 weeks (9.1%) and cuban mothers had the lowest percentage (7.2%). the difference between the highest (puerto rican) and lowest (cuban) percentages of singleton preterm births among the hispanic-origin groups was 1.9 percentage points (before 37 weeks) and 1.3 percentage points (34-36 weeks). central and south american mothers had the lowest percentage of singleton births before 34 weeks. for preterm births before 34 weeks, the difference between the highest (puerto rican) and lowest (central and south american) percentages was 0.2 percentage points (32-33 weeks) and 0.6 percentage points (before 32 weeks). low-risk births delivered by cesarean section during 1999-2014 non-hispanic black mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries among the five racial and ethnic groups (29.9% in 2014); cuban mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries among the five hispanic-origin groups (41.49-6 in 2014). cesarean deliveries comprise approximately one-third of all births in the united states (32.2% in 2014) and can place mothers and infants at increased risk for poor health outcomes (74). over the past decade, professional medical groups have attempted to reduce low-risk cesarean deliveries defined as cesarean deliveries among full term (37 or more completed weeks of gestation), singleton, vertex (head first) births to women giving birth for the first time (75,76). the percentage of low-risk births that were delivered by cesarean section increased from 19.5% to 26.6% during 1999- 2005, stabilized during 2005-2009, and then decreased to 26.0% in 2014 (data table for figure 21). throughout the period 1999-2014, non-hispanic black mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries (29.9% in 2014) among the five racial and ethnic groups, while non- hispanic american indian or alaska native mothers experienced the lowest percentage (21.5% in 2014). the difference between the highest (non-hispanic black) and lowest (non-hispanic american indian or alaska native) percentages widened from 4.8 percentage points in 1999 to 8.4 percentage points in 2014. among hispanic mothers, the percentage of low-risk births that were delivered by cesarean section increased from 18.7% to 24.6% during 1999-2004, increased at a slower rate from 2004-2009, and then remained stable during 2009-2014 (data table for figure 21). throughout the period 1999-2014 cuban mothers experienced the highest percentage of low-risk cesarean deliveries (41.4% in 2014), while mexican mothers experienced the lowest percentage (24.1% in 2014). among hispanic-origin groups, the difference between the highest and lowest percentages of low-risk cesarean deliveries was stable during 1999-2002, widened sharply during 2002-2006, and then narrowed during 2006-2014. the difference between the highest (cuban) and lowest (mexican) percentages was 11.7 percentage points in 1999, 21.5 percentage points in 2006, and 17.3 percentage points in 2014. children and adolescents with obesity in 2011-2014 for children and adolescents aged 2-19 years, hispanic children and adolescents had the highest prevalence of obesity and non-hispanic asian children had the lowest prevalence. childhood obesity is a serious public health challenge in the united states and many other industrialized nations in the world (figure 8) (19,77,78). excess body weight in children is associated with excess morbidity in childhood and excess body weight in adulthood (13,14). obesity among children and adolescents is defined as a body mass index at or above the sex- and age-specific 95th percentile of the cdc growth charts (15). between 1999-2000 and 2013-2014, the percentage of children and adolescents aged 2-19 with obesity increased from 13.9% to 17.2% (79). however, among youth aged 2-19, the prevalence of obesity did not change from 2003-2004 through 2013-2014 (79). in 2011-2014 for children and adolescents aged 2-19, the percentage with obesity was highest for hispanic children and adolescents and lowest for non-hispanic asian children and adolescents. for those aged 2-19, the difference between the highest (hispanic) and lowest (non-hispanic asian) percentages was 13.3 percentage points. for children aged 2-5, the percentage with obesity was highest for hispanic children and lowest for non-hispanic white children. (the estimate for non-hispanic asian children aged 2-5 was not stable and is not shown.) the difference between the highest (hispanic) and lowest (non-hispanic white) percentages was 10.4 percentage points for children aged 2-5. for children aged 6-11, the percentage with obesity was highest for hispanic children and lowest for non-hispanic asian children. for children aged 6-11, the difference between the highest (hispanic) and lowest (non-hispanic asian) percentages was 15.2 percentage points. in 2011-2014 for adolescents aged 12-19, the percentage with obesity was highest for hispanic adolescents and lowest for non-hispanic asian adolescents. the difference between the highest (hispanic) and lowest (non-hispanic asian) percentages was 13.4 percentage points for adolescents aged 12-19 years. hypertension in 2011-2014, non-hispanic black men and women were the most likely to have hypertension compared with adults in the other racial and ethnic groups. hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure, and other health conditions (80,81). in 2011-2014, 84.1% of adults with hypertension were aware of their status, and 76.1% were taking medication to lower their blood pressure (82). despite improvement in increasing the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension among minority groups remains a challenge (83). hypertension is defined as reporting taking antihypertensive medication and/or having a measured systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm hg or a measured diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm hg. the age-adjusted percentage of adults aged 20 and over with hypertension was stable during 1999-2014 (30.8% in 2013-2014) (data table for figure 23). during 1999-2014, non-hispanic black adults had the highest percentage with [[page h3745]] hypertension among the three racial and ethnic groups (42.7%, age-adjusted in 2013-2014), while with the exception of 1999- 2000, adults of mexican origin had the lowest percentage with hypertension (28.8%, age-adjusted in 2013-2014). the difference between the highest and lowest age-adjusted percentages of adults with hypertension among the three racial and ethnic groups was stable during 1999-2014; in 2013-2014, the difference between the highest (non-hispanic black) and lowest (mexican-origin) percentages was 13.9 percentage points. in 2011-2014, the age-adjusted percentage of adult men and women with hypertension was similar (31.0% and 29.7%, respectively, data table for figure 23). the difference between the highest (non-hispanic black) and lowest (hispanic) age-adjusted percentages of men with hypertension among the four racial and ethnic groups was 14.7 percentage points; for women, the difference between the highest (non- hispanic black) and lowest (non-hispanic asian) was 19.0 percentage points in 2011-2014. current cigarette smoking during 1999-2014, differences in cigarette smoking between racial and ethnic groups were larger for women than for men. smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year, accounting for about one in five deaths in the united states (84). smokers are more likely to develop heart disease, stroke, and cancer. smoking also increases the risk for diabetes, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis, and stillbirth (85). during 1999-2014, the age-adjusted percentage of adults aged 18 and over who were current cigarette smokers decreased from 25.2% to 19.0% for men and from 21.6% to 15.1% for women (data table for figure 24). within each of the four racial and ethnic groups, men were more likely to be current cigarette smokers than women. in 2014 for men, the age-adjusted percentage of current cigarette smokers was highest for non-hispanic black men (22.0%) and lowest for hispanic men (13.8%). the difference between the highest and lowest age-adjusted percentages of current cigarette smokers among the four racial and ethnic groups remained stable during 1999-2014 because levels for men in all racial and ethnic groups declined similarly during this period. the difference between the highest (non-hispanic black) and lowest (hispanic) percentages for men was 8.2 percentage points in 2014. for women, non-hispanic white women consistently had the highest age-adjusted percentage of current cigarette smokers among the four racial and ethnic groups throughout 1999-2014 (18.3% in 2014), while non-hispanic asian women had the lowest age-adjusted percentage (5.1% in 2014). for women, the difference between the highest (non-hispanic white) and lowest (non-hispanic asian) percentages narrowed from 17.5 percentage points in 1999 to 13.2 in 2014. during 1999-2014, racial and ethnic differences in cigarette smoking prevalence were larger for women than for men. influenza vaccination during 1999-2014, influenza vaccination was highest for those aged 65 and over and lowest for those aged 18-64, for all racial and ethnic groups. influenza is a serious illness that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. influenza vaccination is especially important for people who are at risk of getting seriously ill from influenza, including those with chronic conditions, older adults, and young children. the percentage of adults aged 18-64 who received an influenza vaccination in the past 12 months remained stable during 1999-2006 and then increased to 35.8% in 2014 (data table for figure 25). this pattern was present for all racial and ethnic groups. decreases in influenza vaccination coverage in 2005 were related to a vaccine shortage (86). for those aged 18-64, no racial and ethnic group was consistently the most likely to receive influenza vaccination during 1999- 2014. in 2014, non-hispanic asian adults had the highest percentage for influenza vaccination receipt (41.3%) and hispanic adults had the lowest percentage (27.9%). for adults aged 18-64, the difference between the highest and lowest percentages of adults receiving an influenza vaccination among the four racial and ethnic groups widened from 6.9 percentage points in 1999 (non-hispanic white compared with hispanic) to 13.4 in 2014 (non-hispanic asian compared with hispanic). for adults aged 65 and over, the percentage who received an influenza vaccination in the past 12 months increased from 65.7% to 70.1% during 1999-2014. during this period, trends in influenza vaccination coverage varied by racial and ethnic group, and no racial and ethnic group was consistently the most or least likely to receive influenza vaccination. in 2014, non-hispanic asian adults had the highest percentage for receipt of influenza vaccination (72.7%) and non-hispanic black adults had the lowest (57.4%). for adults age 65 and over, the difference between the highest (non-hispanic asian) and lowest (non-hispanic black) percentages of older adults receiving an influenza vaccination among the four racial and ethnic groups was stable during 1999-2003 and then narrowed to 15.3 percentage points in 2014. health insurance coverage during 1999 through the first 6 months of 2015 among adults aged 18-64, lack of health insurance coverage was highest among hispanic adults. health insurance is a major determinant of access to health care. children are less likely to be uninsured than adults aged 18-64 because they are more likely to qualify for public coverage, primarily medicaid and the children's health insurance program (chip) (see data table for figure 26 for estimates for children) (26,87). passage of the affordable care act (aca) in 2010 (38) authorized states to expand medicaid eligibility (88) and to establish the health insurance marketplace in 2014. for adults aged 18-64, the percentage without coverage increased from 17.9% to 20.5% during 1999-2013, and then decreased to 12.7% in the first 6 months of 2015 (36). during this period, the trend for lack of coverage varied by racial and ethnic group. during 1999-june 2015, hispanic adults aged 18-64 had the highest percentage without coverage (27.2% in the first 6 months of 2015), and non-hispanic white adults aged 18-64 had the lowest, except in the first 6 months of 2015, when non- hispanic asian adults had the lowest percentage without coverage. the difference between the highest and lowest percentages of adults aged 18-64 without health insurance among the four racial and ethnic groups narrowed from 1999-june 2015. this difference was 24.9 percentage points in 1999 (hispanic adults compared with non-hispanic white adults) and 19.9 percentage points in the first 6 months of 2015 (hispanic adults compared with non-hispanic asian adults). difficulty accessing needed dental care due to cost during 1999-2014 among adults aged 18-64, nonreceipt of needed dental care due to cost was lowest among non-hispanic asian adults. oral health is integral to general health and wellbeing, and forgoing needed dental health care can have serious health effects (89). in general, fewer adults have dental coverage than medical coverage, and dental coverage tends to be less comprehensive (90-92). in 2012, 44% of dental expenditures among adults aged 18-64 were paid out of pocket, a higher out-of-pocket percentage than for any other type of personal health care expenditure (93). the percentage of adults aged 18-64 who did not receive needed dental care in the past 12 months due to cost increased from 9.3% to 17.3% during 1999-2010, and then decreased to 12.6% in 2014 (data table for figure 27). during 1999-2014, non-hispanic asian adults aged 18-64 had the lowest percentage of not receiving needed dental care due to cost (6.3% in 2014) among the four racial and ethnic groups. no racial and ethnic group consistently had the highest percentage of not receiving needed dental care due to cost during 1999-2014. the difference between the highest and lowest percentages of adults not receiving needed dental care due to cost among the four racial and ethnic groups widened during 1999-2010, and then remained stable from 2010-2014 for those aged 18-64. this difference was 5.9 percentage points in 1999 (non-hispanic black compared with non-hispanic asian) and 9.4 percentage points in 2014 (hispanic compared with non-hispanic asian). mrs. beatty. madam speaker, we have heard a lot tonight. we have heard the call to action by members. we have heard the relationship to poverty in health disparities, to the socioeconomic conditions of african americans to health disparities. we have heard the relationship to death by guns to health disparities. we have heard the data and the statistics about the mortality rates from diseases like cardiovascular disease, the leading killer for women and african american women and men. we have heard about the effect of untreated diabetes and how that affects african americans. the list goes on and on, madam speaker. i could tell you whether it is obesity, whether it is stroke--and certainly as a stroke survivor, i understand firsthand the value and the importance of quality, affordable health care--that there are some federal programs that actually work and bridge the gap. i could say wonderful things about the united states health and human services office of minority affairs that provides data and research and services for us. but before i ask my colleague, madam speaker, to say a few words, i ran across something that was said, in my opinion, by one of the most powerful individuals that will go down in current history. and 20 years from now, madam speaker, if i were standing here talking about his legacy, health care would be one of them. let me conclude my part with these brief words that he quoted on april 1 of this year: ``our nation was built on an enduring belief that we are all created equal--regardless of the color of our skin or the station into which we were born. from the ambitions we hold for ourselves to the way we take care of our health, this founding premise serves as the guidepost of our national life.'' yet, to this day, madam speaker, minorities continue to experience the [[page h3746]] healthcare gaps that leave their communities our communities. i will add this to his ending that, madam speaker, tonight, the congressional black caucus asks that we recommit to taking action to overcome these disparities. and that person who will leave a great legacy for these words is no other than our president of these united states, president barack obama. and now as we begin to close our hour, i yield to the gentleman from new york (mr. jeffries). i could not think of a better colleague, a better coanchor, to come and share with us our call to action. my colleague and classmate, congressman jeffries, is a scholar, someone who sits back, listens, and then comes with resolve. he is someone who is no stranger to this process of telling it like it is. he is someone who has spent a lot of time and years with his experience to speak for the individuals of his district. but tonight, madam speaker, i asked him to speak for the congressional black caucus. i asked him to close us out on our call for action as we talk about the health disparities in our african american communities. mr. jeffries. madam speaker, i thank my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from ohio, and our phenomenal anchor for this cbc special order hour today and throughout the second session of the 114th congress. it has been an honor and a privilege to work closely with her. she has done such a phenomenal job, not just on behalf of the people she represents in the great city of columbus, ohio, but all throughout the nation in her various roles, and certainly in her leadership in the congressional black caucus. it is with a heavy heart that i stand on the floor of the house of representatives today and, with great sadness, acknowledge the pain and the suffering and extend my condolences to those who have suffered this great tragedy in orlando, florida, the worst mass shooting in the history of the united states of america. it is a complicated shooting. we understand that it most likely is an act of terror, a hate crime of unspeakable proportions. there are indications that the shooter may have some degree of mental illness and a history of domestic abuse. the shooter appeared to have been, in some measure, on the fbi's radar. but you can add all those things up and there is still something that is missing that we here in congress have the capacity to deal with, and that is the fact that one individual was able to purchase a weapon of mass destruction--which should be reserved for war, not the hunting of human beings in this great democratic republic--and inflict death on 49 individuals and maim in ways that are inhumane to more than 50 others. martin luther king, jr., once said: ``in the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.'' during the 114th congress, there have been more than 100 mass shootings. we often come to the floor of the house of representatives and the speaker or one of his designees stands at the rostrum and asks us, as members of the house, to stand in a moment of silence. and then we go on with business as usual, having done nothing about the tremendous gun violence problem that we have in america. the rest of the world is looking around and saying: what are they doing in the united states of america? five percent of the world's population, 50 percent of the world's guns. it is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns circulating throughout this great land. the fbi and local law enforcement can't tell you where the overwhelming majority of them are because of legislative silence and malpractice. this is an issue, of course, that has great impact on the african american community. homicides are the leading cause of death through guns of younger african american men. so we in the cbc view it as a public health crisis certainly for our community. i think it is one that all americans should view as a health crisis for the entire country. but the thing that is also troubling--and we will have time to deal with this tragedy--is hopefully we will be able to take some commonsense steps in the right direction, including making sure that individuals who are on the terrorist watch list can't purchase weapons of mass destruction. how complicated is that to do? but the thing that is striking for many of us in the african american community is that, when you look at some of the leading causes of death--heart disease being number one, and then, of course, diabetes and childhood obesity being problematic, certain forms of cancer, hiv/ aids infection--many of these illnesses, these ailments that plague the neighborhoods that i represent in central brooklyn, in bedford- stuyvesant, in east new york, in ocean hill-brownsville, in canarsie, and in the west end of coney island, are preventable, preventable by better exercise, preventable by dealing with some of the environmental racism that many low-income communities of color have been subjected to, resulting in incredibly high rates of asthma and other forms of respiratory illness, preventable by better diet. senator booker recently said to many of us--and this has stuck with me--that more african americans in the united states of america die as a result of drive-throughs, not drive-bys. that is because the diet, the access to healthy food, is limited. the food deserts within which many african americans, particularly at the lowest socioeconomic level, are forced to reside in are scandalous. so we in the congressional black caucus believe that we have to deal with these issues in a more meaningful, comprehensive fashion. i am thankful that back at home in the west end of coney island, coney island cathedral, one of the most important religious institutions in brooklyn, is actively engaged in a public health campaign to deal with diabetes and heart disease and many of the other ailments that result from a poor diet that exists, a lack of access to healthy food in the black community. it is a campaign that we want to take across the nation. we are thankful for the work that has been done by the congressional black caucus and by president obama through his leadership of the affordable care act. we now know that over 20 million previously uninsured americans now have access to quality, affordable health care--disproportionately african american. that is a positive step in the right direction. but instead of trying to dismantle this monumental step forward, as house republicans have attempted to do more than 60 times over the last few years, they have a clinical obsession with a law that has been declared constitutional-- not once, but twice--by the united states supreme court. let's figure out ways to come together as a nation, despite our racial, religious, and ethnic differences, to deal with the disparities that exist in the african american community and beyond. and let us come together as a congress and as a nation to deal with the scourge of hate, in its most recent form, directed at the lgbt community down in orlando in such a horrific and invidious fashion. we are better than this. we can do much better here in the united states congress. the congressional black caucus is here to lead the way on issues, worked in partnership hand in hand with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if they are just willing to meet us some of the way, to deal with the issues of health disparities in the african american community and deal with the scourge of gun violence that takes our young boys and girls in shocking numbers and also impacts people all across the country. i thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her leadership and for once again yielding to me and anchoring this special order in such a phenomenal way. mrs. beatty. madam speaker, i thank congressman jeffries. madam speaker, as we close out tonight, i can't think of a better way to take my last 30 seconds than to speak to you and to speak to america and to ask that we take these last seconds in silence as a call to action to prevent the guns being on the street, as a call to action to reduce the health disparities. but in honor of the families in orlando, we give them our commitment that we stand with them and that i stand with all of my friends and constituents and supporters who belong to the lgbt community. [[page h3747]] i yield back the balance of my time. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. madam speaker, i rise in honor of the special order hour titled ``bridging the divide: a call to action by the congressional black caucus to eliminate racial health disparities.'' i would like to thank my colleagues congressman hakeem jeffries and congresswoman joyce beatty for hosting this timely special order. historically, racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have the highest uninsured rates and are less likely to receive preventive and quality health care. while the affordable care act has helped minorities afford health insurance and access quality care, there is still a need to eliminate existing disparities. for example, the department of health and human services is currently working to expand access, end racial and ethnic discrimination, perform outreach to underserved communities, improve workforce diversity, and expand data collection and reporting. while this is an ambitious plan, it is one that is extremely necessary. unfortunately, coverage, access, and outreach may not be the only keys to eliminating disparities. demographic characteristics contribute heavily to racial and ethnic health status. for example, research shows that privately insured african american and hispanic adults fare worse than privately insured white adults along measures to access and use of care. unfortunately, african americans and hispanics are less likely to have a regular provider than their white counterparts. the same research also showed that privately insured african americans and hispanics had less confidence in their ability to pay for medical costs. since social determinants like economic stability, education, and environment play such a large role in how we each view and access health care, many of the changes necessary to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities require a much larger plan than just a focus on health-related programs. reducing disparities in health truly entails addressing racial and ethnic social determinants such as availability of safe housing, affordable food, access to education, job opportunities, community-based resources, public safety, public transportation, and more. our society must make many changes before we can truly eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities because that also means eliminating disparities in many other sectors. i thank congressman jeffries and congresswoman beatty for hosting this poignant special order. ____________________",88245
CREC-2016-06-13-pt1-PgH3747,CREC-2016-06-13,114,TIBET,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3747-H3752] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 2045 TIBET The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. McSally). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 30 minutes. General Leave Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks and to enter additional materials into the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, this week, Washington, D.C., is blessed by the presence of His Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, who is visiting the city from June 12 through June 16 for several events and meetings. This visit provides us not only the opportunity to listen to the Dalai Lama speak about the modern world and confronting conflict, but also to take a look at the crisis that faces Tibet and the Tibetan people and ask why the United States is not doing more to protect the rights and to support the autonomy of the Tibetan people. As we seek to comprehend the senseless violence of yesterday's massacre of at least 49 people in Orlando, Florida, and the wounding of more than 50 others--most members of the LGBT community and many of Hispanic descent, all just enjoying their lives on a Saturday night--I can think of no better source of words of wisdom, tolerance, and peace than of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an opinion piece by the Dalai Lama, entitled: ``The Dalai Lama: Why I'm hopeful about the world's future.'' [From the Washington Post, June 13, 2016] The Dalai Lama: Why I'm Hopeful About the World's Future (By the Dalai Lama) The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the spiritual leader of Tibet. Since 1959, he has lived in exile in Dharamsala in northern India. Almost six decades have passed since I left my homeland, Tibet, and became a refugee. Thanks to the kindness of the government and people of India, we Tibetans found a second home where we could live in dignity and freedom, able to keep our language, culture and Buddhist traditions alive. My generation has witnessed so much violence--some historians estimate that more than 200 million people were killed in conflicts in the 20th century. Today, there is no end in sight to the horrific violence in the Middle East, which in the case of Syria has led to the greatest refugee crisis in a generation. Appalling terrorist attacks--as we were sadly reminded this weekend--have created deep-seated fear. While it would be easy to feel a sense of hopelessness and despair, it is all the more necessary in the early years of the 21st century to be realistic and optimistic. There are many reasons for us to be hopeful. Recognition of universal human rights, including the right to self- determination, has expanded beyond anything imagined a century ago. There is growing international consensus in support of gender equality and respect for women. Particularly among the younger generation, there is a widespread rejection of war as a means of solving problems. Across the world, many are doing valuable work to prevent terrorism, recognizing the depths of misunderstanding and the divisive idea of ``us'' and ``them'' that is so dangerous. Significant reductions in the world's arsenal of nuclear weapons mean that setting a timetable for further reductions and ultimately the elimination of nuclear weapons--a sentiment President Obama recently reiterated in Hiroshima, Japan--no longer seem a mere dream. The notion of absolute victory for one side and defeat of another is thoroughly outdated; in some situations, following conflict, suffering arises from a state that cannot be described as either war or peace. Violence inevitably incurs further violence. Indeed, history has shown that nonviolent resistance ushers in more durable and peaceful democracies and is more successful in removing authoritarian regimes than violent struggle. It is not enough simply to pray. There are solutions to many of the problems we face; new mechanisms for dialogue need to be created, along with systems of education to inculcate moral values. These must be grounded in the perspective that we all belong to one human family and that together we can take action to address global challenges. It is encouraging that we have seen many ordinary people across the world displaying great compassion toward the plight of refugees, from those who have rescued them from the sea, to those who have taken them in and provided friendship and support. As a refugee myself, I feel a strong empathy for their situation and when we see their anguish, we should do all we can to help them. I can also understand the fears of people in host countries, who may feel overwhelmed. The combination of circumstances draws attention to the vital importance of collective action toward restoring genuine peace to the lands these refugees are fleeing. Tibetan refugees have firsthand experience of living through such circumstances and, although we have not yet been able to return to our homeland, we are grateful for the humanitarian support we have received through the decades from friends, including the people of the United States. A further source for hope is the genuine cooperation among the world's nations toward a common goal evident in the Paris accord on climate change. When global warming threatens the health of this planet that is our only home, it is only by considering the larger global interest that local and national interests will be met. I have a personal connection to this issue because Tibet is the world's highest plateau and is an epicenter of global climate change, warming nearly three times as fast as the rest of the world. It is the largest repository of water outside the two poles and the source of the Earth's most extensive river system, critical to the world's 10 most densely populated nations. To find solutions to the environmental crisis and violent conflicts that confront us in the 21st century, we need to seek new answers. Even though I am a Buddhist monk, I believe that these solutions lie beyond religion in the promotion of a concept I call secular ethics. This is an approach to educating ourselves based on scientific findings, common experience and common sense--a more universal approach to the promotion of our shared human values. Over more than three decades, my discussions with scientists, educators and social workers from across the globe have revealed common concerns. As a result we have developed a system that incorporates an education of the heart, but one that is based on study of the workings of the mind and emotions through scholarship and scientific research rather than religious practice. Since we need moral principles--compassion, respect for others, kindness, taking responsibility--in every field of human activity, we are working to help schools and colleges create opportunities for young people to develop greater self-awareness, to learn how to manage destructive emotions and cultivate social skills. Such training is being incorporated into the curriculum of many schools in North America and Europe--I am involved with work at Emory University on a new curriculum on secular ethics that is being introduced in several schools in India and the United States. [[Page H3748]] It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the 21st century does not repeat the pain and bloodshed of the past. Because human nature is basically compassionate, I believe it is possible that decades from now we will see an era of peace--but we must work together as global citizens of a shared planet. Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by way of welcoming the Dalai Lama, I would like to say a few words about him and his leadership. The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, describes himself as a simple Buddhist monk. He was recognized as the reincarnation of the previous 13th Dalai Lama when he was only 2 years old, and he was only 6 when he began his monastic studies. But years before he finished his education, when he was still a teenager, he was called upon to assume full political power after China's invasion of Tibet in 1950. When in 1954 he went to Beijing for peace talks with Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders, he was not yet 20. Five years later, with the brutal suppression of the Tibetan national uprising in Lhasa by Chinese troops, the Dalai Lama was forced to escape into exile. Since 1959, he has been living in northern India. That is more than 60 years of exile. I have had the opportunity to meet the Dalai Lama on a number of occasions. He is a warm, generous, compassionate man with a great sense of humor. He is also a man of peace. He has consistently advocated for policies of nonviolence even in the face of extreme aggression. In 1989, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent struggle for the liberation of Tibet. He has received over 150 awards, honorary doctorates, and prizes in recognition of his message of peace, nonviolence, interreligious understanding, universal responsibility, and compassion. His is a voice for tolerance. Unfortunately, as we all know, Tibet has not been liberated. In the late 1990s, under the Dalai Lama's leadership, the Tibetan people formally put aside the goal of independence. Since then, they have been fighting, peacefully, for their autonomy within China; but that struggle is not going very well today. Part of the reason it is not going very well is that the international community seems to be more interested in not offending China than in vigorously supporting the human rights of the Tibetan people. It seems to me that my own government has fallen into that trap. I am looking forward to the Dalai Lama's visit this week, and I know that the leadership of the House and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will welcome him with the greatest appreciation; but it is easy to praise the Dalai Lama, to meet with him, and to benefit from his teachings, yet not lift a finger to help the people of Tibet. The Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people deserve better. Madam Speaker, last November I had the honor of joining Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and my colleagues Joyce Beatty, Ted Lieu, Alan Lowenthal, Betty McCollum, and Tim Walz on a historic congressional delegation to Tibet, Beijing, and Hong Kong. I have long raised concerns about China's human rights record in Tibet. As the first congressional delegation to enter Tibet since the 2008 unrest, our trip was an important opportunity to raise the voices of the Tibetan people, and we did just that. Everywhere we went, in every meeting we had, we talked about Tibet. We talked about the Dalai Lama and his strong bipartisan support in Congress. We talked about the importance of respect for people's cultures and religions, and we talked about the need to strengthen and protect all of the human rights of the Tibetan people. During the delegation visit, we felt we had a good exchange with Chinese officials and, especially, with university students both in Tibet and in Beijing. We saw our trip--and especially the delegation's visit to Tibet--as an important gesture by the Chinese Government; but it was also clear to us that our visit was only a first step and that much more needed to be done. Since our return, we have been looking for ways to build on our visit and to advance the reforms needed for meaningful change. Here are some of the things we identified that need to happen specifically with regard to Tibet: The United States needs to open a consulate in Lhasa, Tibet; More Members of Congress, more journalists, more members of parliament from other nations, and more people in general, including members of the Tibetan community here in the United States, need to be allowed to travel freely to Tibet; Tibetans in China need to be able to travel freely as well; The dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama to resolve longstanding issues of Tibetan autonomy, religious practice, culture, language, and heritage needs to be renewed. I came away from our visit believing even more strongly that the Dalai Lama is part of the solution to resolving Tibetan grievances. Too often during our trip, we heard from some Chinese officials--not all, but some--expressions and characterizations of Tibet and the Dalai Lama that showed that some people's minds and imaginations are stuck in the past, in old prejudices. This concerned me greatly. The issue is not the past. The issue is the future of Tibet and its people. Renewing dialogue must be genuine and productive, and it cannot be just another guise for wasting time or going through the motions. We need to see a dialogue based on good faith and on the mutual need to resolve outstanding issues in a way that is acceptable to all parties. Undertaking such an initiative would be a positive reflection on the capacity of Chinese authorities to engage in constructive dialogue, and it would increase confidence the world over that the government is committed to reconciliation and ending abuses in Tibet. The Chinese Government has invested a great deal in Tibet, and that was very clear to us, but that investment must not come at the price of an entire culture. You cannot confine a people's culture and heritage-- their very sense of identity--to a museum or to a market of handicrafts. The human rights of the Tibetan people must be strengthened and protected, and I returned from the delegation visit with a renewed commitment to continue to work with my colleagues in Congress, with Leader Pelosi, to push for the reforms that are needed to achieve this, and this is the reason we are here today. Madam Speaker, I yield to our distinguished Democratic leader, who led this historic visit to Tibet, Leader Pelosi. Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for calling this Special Order this evening. Special it is, indeed, as we welcome His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, to Washington, D.C. Tomorrow, in a bipartisan way, House and Senate Democrats and Republicans will join in welcoming His Holiness. He is among one of the things we all agree on--his greatness and the honor he brings us with his visit. Madam Speaker, I completely associate myself with every word of Mr. McGovern's comments. He talked about our visit to Lhasa, to Tibet, and to other places in China. We called him Mr. McGovern's spiritual leader of our visit. As the co-chair of the Lantos Human Rights Commission of the House of Representatives, he truly believes, as His Holiness says and as I heard him say today, that we are all God's children, and that is how we have to treat each other. In listening to our colleagues of the previous Special Order, who were members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who discussed various issues of justice--social justice, health justice, and the rest--and who talked about Orlando, it focuses on how special His Holiness' visit is. In coming the day after the terrible massacre of many in the LGBT community, it is really something that should be a comfort to all of us. His Holiness' message of peace, of compassion, of respect for every person is a message of hope that is needed today, tomorrow, and the next day, which are the days His Holiness will be here, but it is needed as we go forward as well. He is a truly great man. When I awoke this morning so sad about what happened yesterday, I was full of hope about hearing what His Holiness would have to say about our responsibilities to each other. Our colleague mentioned our November CODEL. It was something that many of us had been hoping to do for many years. We had been trying for 25 years to get a visa to visit Tibet, and [[Page H3749]] the President of China gave us that opportunity. We went there to see, to learn, to observe, and to make judgments. We did not go there to burn bridges; we went there to build bridges. As Congressman McGovern said, we saw some areas in which we could work together, and we came back with some resolve, hopefully, to get other bridge building done. I have seen His Holiness on many occasions. When he first came to Congress, I was brand new in Congress. He came under the auspices of Mr. Lantos, for whom the Human Rights Commission is named, and he brought us together in a group to listen to His Holiness' plan of action. It included respect for the environment and autonomy for Tibet but not independence. That was over 25 years ago that he had been talking about autonomy. While sometimes the Chinese Government doesn't accept that characterization, it is why many of us support His Holiness. As I mentioned earlier, he has friends on both sides of the aisle on both sides of the Capitol and also down Pennsylvania Avenue. I remember with great pride when we presented His Holiness with a Congressional Gold Medal--again, with great bipartisan support. President Bush came. Not only that--and a bigger honor yet--Mrs. Laura Bush came as well. What an honor for His Holiness and what an honor for our country that our President showed that respect. On that day when we talked about it, we had so many good things to say about His Holiness. One of the things was his unstinting support for peace as a positive example of how to make the world a better place--peace in the world, peace in our country, peace in our communities, peace in our families, peace in ourselves. That inner peace is what he has been preaching. On this trip, we can see His Holiness as he embodies the wisdom and the courage to maintain what he calls a peaceful mind in a modern world, and we look forward to hearing what he has to say about that. In addition to saying we are all God's children and of the respect we need to have for each other and of the compassion that he advocates, His Holiness says that great changes start with individuals. I will tell this story, which, I think, some may find amusing. His Holiness is a gentle man. While he has big challenges and while he is the leader and the champion in the advocacy--I wouldn't use the word ``fight'' as he doesn't like words like that--for respecting the culture, the language, and the religion of the Tibetan people and the autonomy for them as a people, he does so in a very gentle way. I met him here in the Capitol for the first time, and I saw him in Rio at the time of the Earth Summit in 1992, where he spoke as a religious leader. We also acknowledged that he was the first winner of the Nobel Prize--it was part of his proclamation and why he won--for his contribution in protecting the environment. It was the first environmental consideration in a Nobel Prize. How beautiful that was. I have seen him here many times, in California, in New York--you name it--and in Dharamsala, which is where he lives in India. Anyway, we were taking a delegation there to visit--a bipartisan, large delegation to visit him there. {time} 2100 And we saw some of the people right after the crackdown in Tibet-- coincidentally, we had our trip planned for a long time, but it happened to occur right after that crackdown. So many people were coming in from Tibet telling us what they saw there. It was pretty brutal, the reports that they gave us, and it was so sad. So later in the day, when we had lunch with the couple hundred lamas from all over India, that part of India, many of them Tibetan Buddhist lamas, I explained what I had seen that morning and how transformative it was to see people get firsthand knowledge of the humanity of man and that we had to do something about it. We had our Members there. One was going to help with this, and one was going to help with that. You know, there were all these things that we were going to do to help these people. And then I said what I always said: if freedom-loving people do not speak out against oppression in Tibet because of our commercial interests with China, then we surrender all moral authority to speak on behalf of human rights anywhere in the world. Tibet remains a challenge to the conscience of the world, and we must respond to that. When I was finished, His Holiness spoke to the lamas there, and he said to the lamas: Now, let us all pray so that we could rid Nancy of her negative attitudes. Well, I thought I was making the fight, but I am not going to be holier than His Holiness. A gentle approach is what he thinks is best and respectful. I take some level of pride in telling our Chinese friends--and they are our friends. He is your friend, too, in terms of damping down any, shall we say, exuberance when we learn what we consider to be grave injustices and human rights violations. In honor of His Holiness' 80th birthday last summer--Richard Gere is the chairman of the International Campaign for Tibet and has really been a champion for His Holiness and the Tibetan people--Richard Gere and I wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed, and in it we said there is no better way to honor the Dalai Lama than by standing with him and the Tibetan people vowing to keep their cause alive. It is a beautiful culture, indeed. To hear His Holiness, as I did today, speak in Tibetan, which I didn't understand except through translation, and have him explain that the Tibetan language is a beautiful language in specifics, in terms of explaining Buddhism and matters of faith and philosophy because of its intricacies. It enhances your appreciation and understanding of Buddhism to hear it in the words of the Tibetan language, and translated from Tibetan in terms of the intricacies of the language that you would need to translate it into English or another language. So this language is important to the faith of Buddhism. It is important to the culture. It is important to the families. It is important, again, to the education of the children. And the attempts on the part of the Chinese to resettle Han Chinese, dilute the population of Tibetans in Tibet, is something that would be just really wrong, just plain and simple wrong. Again, it is a challenge to the conscience. This morning, His Holiness spoke at the United States Institute of Peace, and he said real change comes through action. He said: You all ask me for my blessing, and people say nice things, but real change comes through action. If I understood it correctly in the translation, he said that karma is not necessarily just about fate. It is about acting, action, taking action. So we all need to take action in what we believe in. Again, every opportunity I get--and I thank the distinguished gentleman, the conscience of our codel and chair of the Tom Lantos Commission on Human Rights. Every opportunity I get, and this is one of them that I treasure on the floor of the House, to say what an honor it is to even be in the same room, the same place with His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, a revered figure throughout the world. The Dalai Lama's name is synonymous with everything that is good, and that is what we emphasized to our Chinese host. We had to move, as Mr. McGovern said, beyond their outmoded thinking into another place. In terms of His Holiness, tomorrow when he comes to the Capitol, I will look forward to thanking him for his tremendous, inspiring leadership. ``Inspiration'' is such an inadequate word when it comes to what he is. We thank him for sharing the strength of his determination in pursuit of peace. He was speaking about it today in terms of something that might take some years. We may not see it, some of us--you might, Mr. McGovern; I might not--a time when the world was completely at peace. When he laughs, it is something very special. We hear the joyousness that transcends despair. In his words, we receive a message of hope and humanity when he is with us. In his presence, we feel inspired to make a difference, to make a difference in ourselves and in our world. I talked earlier about President Bush coming to the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony, and I know that the President will be receiving His Holiness this week. Presidents have done that over time, which is a source of great pride for us in our country and in [[Page H3750]] the relationship between His Holiness and our President. But it goes a long way back. I will just close by saying, when His Holiness was a very little boy and he became the Dalai Lama, he received a gift from the President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt; and he loved it because it was a watch, and the watch had the phases of the Moon. Actually, my Apple watch has the phases of the Sun. The watch had the phases of the Moon, and how prescient President Franklin Roosevelt was to send this little boy this watch, who would become so interested in science and thinking and the brain and faith and what the connection was among all of those factors. But again, the relationship between an American President and His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, goes back to when he was a little boy, and it persists into his eighties now. That is something that, again, brings luster to us in our country that we have such a beautiful relationship with such a spiritual figure in the world. So I look forward to welcoming him here tomorrow. Again, as I said to him today: You could not have come at a better time when we are so in mourning about what happened in Orlando to our LGBT loved ones, to their families, to the community in Orlando. We are grateful to the response of our first responders there and our law enforcement officials and local officials there. Again, it is the spirituality that we need to recover and draw strength to go forward to make sure that we minimize any such actions that hopefully they never happen again. How wonderful that His Holiness is here to bring us that comfort. With that, I am pleased and with great gratitude to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for being such a champion of human rights throughout the world. He and Mr. Pitts, his Republican counterpart, as co-chairs of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, do a great service to our Congress and to our country. They honor our values, the respect for the dignity and worth of every person, recognizing that we are all God's children. We all have a spark of divinity in us, and they always are speaking truth to power. I thank them for their commitment and for their courage, and to you, Mr. McGovern, for calling this Special Order today. Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished leader for being here, and I appreciate her leadership on this issue and her leadership on human rights issues. One of the things that compels us to be here today is our continued concern about the human rights situation for the Tibetan people. And whether it is the latest annual report from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom or whether it is the U.S. State Department's most recent human rights report, or almost any other report, quite frankly, by any major world respected human rights organization, we see that the conditions for the Tibetan people really are quite dire. The Human Rights Watch report, entitled, ``Relentless'' talks about the detention and prosecution of Tibetans from 2013 to 2015 under China's ``stability maintenance'' campaign. The report is based on 479 cases of Tibetans detained or tried for political expression or criticism of government policy. Human Rights Watch only included cases on which its staff was able to obtain credible information. One important source was the terrific database on political prisoners in China that was maintained by the Congressional Executive Commission on China. Without going into a lot of details, let me just highlight a couple of takeaways. Tibetans are now being detained for activities that used to be considered minor offences or not politically sensitive. Many of those detained and prosecuted come from parts of society not previously known for dissent: local community leaders, environmental activists, and villagers involved in social and cultural activities, as well as local writers and singers. I can go on and on and on. I include into the Record the Human Rights Watch report, entitled, ``Relentless,'' Madam Speaker. Relentless: Detention and Prosecution of Tibetans Under China's ``Stability Maintenance'' Campaign Summary We have followed the law in striking out and relentlessly pounding at illegal organizations and key figures, and resolutely followed the law in striking at the illegal organizations and key figures who follow the 14th Dalai Lama clique in carrying out separatist, infiltration, and sabotage activities, knocking out the hidden dangers and soil for undermining Tibet's stability, and effectively safeguarding the state's utmost interests [and] society's overall interests.--Statement by Chen Quanguo, Tibet Autonomous Region Party Secretary, December 2013 This report documents the Chinese government's detention, prosecution, and conviction of Tibetans for largely peaceful activities from 2013 to 2015. Our research shows diminishing tolerance by authorities for forms of expression and assembly protected under international law. This has been marked by an increase in state control over daily life, increasing criminalization of nonviolent forms of protest, and at times disproportionate responses to local protests. These measures, part of a policy known as weiwen or ``stability maintenance,'' have led authorities to expand the range of activities and issues targeted for repression in Tibetan areas, particularly in the countryside. The analysis presented here is based on our assessment of 479 cases for which we were able to obtain credible information. All cases are of Tibetans detained or tried from 2013 to 2015 for political expression or criticism of government policy--``political offenses.'' Our cases paint a detailed picture not available elsewhere. Stringent limitations on access to Tibet and on information flows out of Tibet mean we cannot conclude definitively that our cases are representative of the unknown overall number of political detentions of Tibetans during this period. But they are indicative of the profound impact stability maintenance'' policies have had in those areas, and of shifts in the types of protest and protester Chinese authorities are targeting there. Information on the cases comes from the Chinese government, exile organizations, and foreign media. Of the 479 detainees, 153 were reported to have been sent for trial, convicted, and sentenced to imprisonment. The average sentence they received was 5.7 years in prison. As explained in the methodology section below, the actual number of Tibetans detained and prosecuted during this period for political offenses was likely significantly higher. Many detentions documented here were for activities that the Chinese authorities previously considered to be minor offenses or not politically sensitive. Many of those detained came from segments of society not previously associated with dissent. In addition, many of the detentions took place in rural areas where political activity had not previously been reported. From 2008 to 2012, the Tibetan parts of Sichuan province had posted the highest numbers of protests and detentions on the Tibetan plateau, but in 2013 the epicenter of detentions shifted to the central and western areas of the Tibetan plateau, called the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) since 1965, which until 1950 had been under the government of the Dalai Lama. Our research found that many of those detained and prosecuted were local community leaders, environmental activists, and villagers involved in social and cultural activities, as well as local writers and singers. In the previous three decades, the authorities had rarely accused people from these sectors of Tibetan society of involvement in political unrest. Buddhist monks and nuns, who constituted over 90 percent of political detainees in Tibet in the 1980s, represent less than 40 percent of the 479 cases documented here. Almost all the protests and detentions identified in this report occurred in small towns or rural townships and villages rather than in cities, where most protests and detentions in prior years were reported to have taken place. This suggests that dissent has increased in rural Tibetan areas, where nearly 80 percent of Tibetans live. Our data also shows an overall decline in the total number of Tibetans detained for political offenses between 2013 and 2015, though this may be an artifact of the limitations on information, detailed in the methodology section below. Notably, however, the totals for these three years are significantly higher than for the 10 years before 2008 when stability maintenance policies were expanded following major protests centered in Lhasa (Ch.: Lasa), the capital of the TAR. The changing nature of unrest and politicized detention in Tibet correlates with new phases in the stability maintenance campaign in the TAR and other Tibetan areas. Since 2011, authorities have intensified social control and surveillance at the grassroots level, particularly in the rural areas of the TAR. This has included the transfer of some 21,000 officials to villages and monasteries in the TAR, where they are tasked with implementing new management, security, and propaganda operations, and, more recently, the deployment of nearly 10,000 police in Tibetan villages in Qinghai. This has led to a surge in the creation of local Communist Party organizations, government offices, police posts, security patrols, and political organizations in Tibetan villages and towns, particularly in the TAR. The implementation of these measures appears to explain many of the new patterns of detention, prosecution, and sentencing documented in this report. It was only after the [[Page H3751]] rural phase of the stability maintenance policy in the TAR was implemented from late 2011 that the number of protests and resulting detentions and convictions increased dramatically in that region. These detentions, occurring primarily in rural areas, indicate that the stability maintenance policy in the TAR has entered a third phase. The first phase entailed paramilitary operations in the immediate wake of the 2008 protests in Lhasa, when the authorities detained several thousand people suspected of involvement in those protests or associated rioting. The second phase, which began in late 2011 and is ongoing, involved the transfer of officials to run security and propaganda operations in villages, as described above. The third phase, which dates to early 2013, has involved increasing use of the surveillance and security mechanisms established during the second phase in rural villages of the TAR to single out activities deemed to be precursors of unrest. This has meant that formerly anodyne activities have become the focus of state attention and punishment, including social activities by villagers that had not previously been put under sustained scrutiny by the security forces. In the eastern Tibetan areas--comprising parts of Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, and Yunnan provinces--politicized detentions also appear to correlate with stability maintenance measures. But in these areas, the government's measures have been aimed primarily at stopping self-immolations by Tibetans protesting Chinese rule, most of which have taken place in the eastern areas. Beginning in December 2012 the authorities there conducted an intensified drive to end self-immolations among Tibetans that resulted in a sharp increase in detentions and prosecutions of Tibetans for alleged connections to self- immolations, often with tenuous legal basis. The government's introduction of grassroots stability maintenance mechanisms in the TAR and of measures against self-immolation in the eastern areas, including in many previously quiet rural areas, has resulted in certain Tibetan localities becoming sites of repeated protests and detentions, producing what could be called protest ``cluster sites,'' previously unseen in Tibetan areas. These localities saw greater numbers of politicized detentions, recurrent cycles of protest and detention, higher average sentencing rates compared to other areas, and longer sentences for relatively minor offenses. During 2013-2015, lay and religious leaders of rural communities often received unusually heavy sentences for expressions of dissent, especially if they were from a protest cluster site. Having a sensitive image or text on one's cellphone or computer could also lead to a long prison sentence, especially though not only if it had been sent to other people. Among those who received the longest sentences were people who tried to assist victims of self-immolations, leaders of protests against mining or government construction projects, and organizers of village opposition to unpopular decisions by local officials. Such activities, most of which were not explicitly political and did not directly challenge the legitimacy of the state, received markedly longer sentences than people shouting slogans or distributing leaflets in support of Tibetan independence. The incidents described in this report indicate that outbursts of unrest and waves of politicized detentions occurred in specific localities at certain times rather than being evenly dispersed across the Tibetan areas. But the range of locations and the different social levels of protesters involved suggest that political, environmental, and cultural discontent is widespread among Tibetans in many parts of the plateau. Deaths and ill-health of detainees also continued to be a serious problem in the period covered by this study. Fourteen of those detained, 2.9 percent of the total, were reported to have died in custody or shortly after release, allegedly as a result of mistreatment. The cases also involve the detention of children, including a 14 and a 15-year-old, both monks, and at least one 11-year- old child detained after his father self-immolated. The detentions, prosecutions, and convictions documented here reflect the impact of intensive new efforts by officials in Tibetan areas to prevent any repeat of the Tibet-wide protests that occurred in the spring of 2008. Yet the new policies have led to apparently unprecedented cycles of discontent in certain rural areas, and an overall increase in the types of activities that are treated as criminal challenges to the authority of the Communist Party or the Chinese state. The failure of the central government and local authorities to end these abusive policies and roll back intrusive security and surveillance measures raises the prospect of an intensified cycle of repression and resistance in a region already enduring extraordinary restrictions on basic human rights. Recommendations To the Government of China Unconditionally release from custody all persons detained without charge or convicted for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and belief, or for other conduct protected by international human rights law. Allow independent observers--including journalists, human rights monitors, and United Nations special procedures-- unimpeded access to all areas covered by the ``stability maintenance'' campaign to verify the extent of human rights violations stemming from the campaign's implementation. Ensure that all persons taken into custody have immediate access to lawyers and family members. Those taken into custody should be released unless promptly brought before a court and charged with an offense. End the collective punishment of community members for the actions, criminal or not, of local leaders or other members of their community. Conduct credible, transparent, and impartial investigations into all incidents from 2013 to 2015 that resulted in alleged extrajudicial killings, or alleged torture or other ill- treatment in custody. Make the findings of those investigations public and fairly prosecute anyone responsible for such abuses. Conduct credible, transparent, and impartial investigations into arbitrary detentions and deaths stemming from the March 2008 protests in Lhasa and across Tibetan areas. End interference by officials, party representatives, and the security forces in monasteries and other religious institutions. To the United Nations The UN secretary-general should urge China to honor the offer it made before the Human Rights Council in March 2009 to invite the UN high commissioner for human rights ``at a time mutually convenient to both sides.'' The UN high commissioner for human rights should specifically request to visit the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Tibetan Autonomous Areas in Qinghai and Sichuan provinces. The UN high commissioner for human rights, as well as the special rapporteurs and working groups on torture, enforced disappearances, and independence of judges and lawyers, should reiterate their requests to visit the region to assess the human rights situation. To Concerned Governments Urge the Chinese government to implement the following measures in Tibetan areas: provide information on all persons detained in connection with protests; end arbitrary detention and torture and other ill-treatment in detention; impartially investigate the use of excessive or lethal force by the security forces; and discipline or prosecute as appropriate members of the security forces implicated in serious abuses. Extend full and active support to the international investigation into the Tibetan protests led by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Urge the Chinese government to review the official policies and practices in Tibetan areas that have contributed to unrest. Speak out, when cooperating with China on law enforcement or counterterrorism efforts, against the use of trumped-up public order and terrorism allegations to persecute or curtail the human rights of ethnic groups. Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, this Congress has weighed in many times and in many ways on United States policy concerning Tibet. One of the most significant things we did was to approve the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, which is supposed to guide U.S. Government policy. It encourages dialogue between the Chinese Government and representatives of the Dalai Lama, and it created the post of Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues within the Department of State. Last July, in recognition of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama's 80th birthday, the House approved H. Res. 337, which cited the Tibetan Policy Act. In that resolution, Congress strongly encouraged the Government of the People's Republic of China and His Holiness to hold substantive dialogue, without preconditions, in order to address Tibetan grievances and secure a negotiated agreement for the Tibetan people. We also called for the establishment of a U.S. consulate in Lhasa. We urged the immediate and unconditional release of Tibetan political prisoners, including the 11th Panchen Lama, and Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, a Tibetan monk who tragically and unnecessarily died in Chinese custody shortly after. We called on the United States Government to underscore that any government's interference in the Tibetan reincarnation process is a violation of the internationally recognized right to religious freedom. We called upon the Government of China to allow U.S. officials and journalists and other citizens unrestricted access to Tibetan areas of China, as we allow Chinese officials and citizens access to the United States' territory. We asked that the United States and international governments, organizations, and civil society renew and reinforce initiatives to promote the preservation of the distinct religious, cultural, linguistic, and national identity of the Tibetan people. We urged the United States to use its voice and vote to encourage development organizations and agencies to design and implement development [[Page H3752]] projects that fully comply with the Tibet Project principles. These principles are meant to ensure that the needs of the Tibetan people guide all development in Tibetan areas; that their projects respect Tibetan culture, traditions, knowledge, and wisdom; and that the development initiatives neither provide incentives for nor facilitate the migration and settlement of non-Tibetans into Tibet, nor the transfer of ownership of Tibetan land or natural resources to non- Tibetans. All of these recommendations for what the United States Government should be doing are just as valid today as they were last year because very little progress has been made in the last year. I say ``very little'' because we have acknowledged the important gesture China made in allowing last fall's codel to travel to Tibet, but that is about all that has happened, and the Dalai Lama is about to be a year older. If we are not going to get moving on those longstanding recommendations, let me suggest some other things we could try. We could start a campaign to get China to allow the Dalai Lama to return to Tibet. Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state and, two, everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country. It is time to let the Dalai Lama return to his country. This House could pass a bill that I introduced, the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act, basically saying that, if the Chinese Government restricts U.S. officials and U.S. citizens access to Tibet, then we should consider limiting the access of Chinese officials when they visit the United States. We could make sure that the U.S. Government invites the Dalai Lama to every event on every occasion where his decades of knowledge, experience, and reflections would be helpful for addressing the world's problems. The Dalai Lama is a world spiritual and philosophical leader who should be contributing to global debates on countering violent extremism and on fostering peace in war-torn countries. These are just a couple of topics on which I am convinced we could all benefit from his wisdom. We could insist that Tibet be part of our climate change discussions with China. Climate change is one of the few topics on which the U.S. and China have found common ground. It is a critically important topic for Tibet, given its fragile environment and its critically important reserves of freshwater. Tibet is warming three times as fast as the rest of the world, but it is absent from the global climate change debate. {time} 2115 The Chinese leadership has acknowledged at the highest levels the scale of the environmental crisis it faces. Conserving the Tibetan Plateau is surely a shared interest, and it can only be achieved with the full participation of the Tibetan people. It is time to rally around some of these ideas or to find others. It is time to do something different on Tibet. It is time for us to think differently and to think out of the box on ways that we can advance dialogue with China, not in a confrontational way, but in ways to get China to understand the importance of recognizing the human rights of the Tibetan people and recognizing the importance of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and allowing him to return to his homeland. Madam Speaker, many of my colleagues wanted to be here today to speak on this. I include the statements of the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) in the Record. Last week the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) submitted their statements to the Record. In closing, again, I would urge all of my colleagues to join with the leader and myself in welcoming His Holiness the Dalai Lama to Washington, D.C., to the United States, wishing him good health and praying that reconciliation between the Tibetan people and the Chinese Government happens very, very soon. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I believe that the U.S. must remain committed to defending human rights and personal freedoms both within the U.S. and abroad. As our country continues to advance U.S.-China relations, we must never forget the people of Tibet. Restrictions on human rights and religious freedom in Tibet have been a growing concern to many. As a member of the Congressional Executive Committee on China, I share this concern. While Chinese investments have undoubtedly helped to modernize Tibet, these investments must not come at the expense of the rich cultural, linguistic, and religious heritage of the Tibetan people. We must continue to support the protection of traditional Tibetan culture. As you may know, I had the opportunity to be one of the first groups of Americans to travel to China and teach Chinese high school students in 1989. During that trip, I also traveled to Tibet in 1990 and, most recently, I have returned as a member of the Congressional Delegation visiting China and Tibet. The boosted economic growth, higher household incomes, and constructed railway projects have facilitated the rapid modernization of the Tibet Autonomous Region. However, we need to continue to have constructive dialogues with China to ensure the preservation of traditional Tibetan culture and Tibet's fragile ecology. The Congressional Delegation trip to Tibet provided an opportunity to have a healthy dialogue, and I want to thank our Chinese friends for engaging with us in a discussion over the most sensitive issues concerning Tibet. As a southern Minnesotan, I understand the importance of spurring economic growth while simultaneously protecting natural wonders and culture. With this in mind, I believe that Tibetans must receive the necessary rights that will allow them to protect their culture, language, religion, and environment. The U.S. was founded on the ideas of universal freedom, and I believe that we must continue to urge the Chinese government to provide less regulated religious freedom to the Tibetans. I strongly believe that a critical step to achieving religious freedom in Tibet is including the Dalai Lama in future dialogues. I have had the pleasure of meeting His Holiness on three occasions, and I share his desire to preserve Tibetan culture and resolve other issues concerning Tibet. Lastly, I encourage the Chinese government to agree to establish a U.S. Consulate in the Tibetan city of Lhasa because I believe diplomacy and talking through our concerns and partnerships under the lens of transparency can only strengthen the relationship between our two countries. I will continue to support attempts to have productive dialogues with the Chinese government concerning the future of Tibet. Improvements in the quality of life, access to clean water, and access to health care services in Tibet must also include efforts to preserve the Tibetan way of life. Mr. CAPUANO. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to His Holiness the Dalai Lama. He has come to Washington to be present when the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) awards its Democracy Service Medal posthumously to another heroic spiritual leader, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, who died in captivity in China in July of last year. The NED will also honor the Central Tibetan Administration, based in Dharamshala, India, for its commitment to freedom and democracy. It is fitting, too, as Prime Minister Nahrendra Modi concludes his visit, to recognize the generosity India has shown to exiles seeking political and religious liberty within its borders. With His Holiness and with all Tibetans, we grieve for all they have endured since the Chinese invasion, the sorrows of those who live in exile and the sufferings of those who remain. I am outraged that oppression and murder continue unabated. With His Holiness and with Tenzin Delek Rinpoche's cousin Geshe Nyima, representing his bereaved family, we mourn the shameful persecution and tragic death of a man committed to nonviolence. I urge the House to approve H. Res 584, urging President Obama to seek an independent investigation of his death and to call publicly for an end to the repressive policies of the People's Republic of China in Tibet. It has been in committee for many months. Elie Wiesel, like His Holiness awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, exhorts us: There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest. Indeed, we do protest, and further we should never cease to hold oppressors accountable. The people of Tibet, inspired by the Dalai Lama, continue to cherish their culture and traditions. I wish them all his faith and courage, today, tomorrow and every day until Tibet is free. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3747-H3752] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 2045 TIBET The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. McSally). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 30 minutes. General Leave Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks and to enter additional materials into the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, this week, Washington, D.C., is blessed by the presence of His Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, who is visiting the city from June 12 through June 16 for several events and meetings. This visit provides us not only the opportunity to listen to the Dalai Lama speak about the modern world and confronting conflict, but also to take a look at the crisis that faces Tibet and the Tibetan people and ask why the United States is not doing more to protect the rights and to support the autonomy of the Tibetan people. As we seek to comprehend the senseless violence of yesterday's massacre of at least 49 people in Orlando, Florida, and the wounding of more than 50 others--most members of the LGBT community and many of Hispanic descent, all just enjoying their lives on a Saturday night--I can think of no better source of words of wisdom, tolerance, and peace than of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an opinion piece by the Dalai Lama, entitled: ``The Dalai Lama: Why I'm hopeful about the world's future.'' [From the Washington Post, June 13, 2016] The Dalai Lama: Why I'm Hopeful About the World's Future (By the Dalai Lama) The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the spiritual leader of Tibet. Since 1959, he has lived in exile in Dharamsala in northern India. Almost six decades have passed since I left my homeland, Tibet, and became a refugee. Thanks to the kindness of the government and people of India, we Tibetans found a second home where we could live in dignity and freedom, able to keep our language, culture and Buddhist traditions alive. My generation has witnessed so much violence--some historians estimate that more than 200 million people were killed in conflicts in the 20th century. Today, there is no end in sight to the horrific violence in the Middle East, which in the case of Syria has led to the greatest refugee crisis in a generation. Appalling terrorist attacks--as we were sadly reminded this weekend--have created deep-seated fear. While it would be easy to feel a sense of hopelessness and despair, it is all the more necessary in the early years of the 21st century to be realistic and optimistic. There are many reasons for us to be hopeful. Recognition of universal human rights, including the right to self- determination, has expanded beyond anything imagined a century ago. There is growing international consensus in support of gender equality and respect for women. Particularly among the younger generation, there is a widespread rejection of war as a means of solving problems. Across the world, many are doing valuable work to prevent terrorism, recognizing the depths of misunderstanding and the divisive idea of ``us'' and ``them'' that is so dangerous. Significant reductions in the world's arsenal of nuclear weapons mean that setting a timetable for further reductions and ultimately the elimination of nuclear weapons--a sentiment President Obama recently reiterated in Hiroshima, Japan--no longer seem a mere dream. The notion of absolute victory for one side and defeat of another is thoroughly outdated; in some situations, following conflict, suffering arises from a state that cannot be described as either war or peace. Violence inevitably incurs further violence. Indeed, history has shown that nonviolent resistance ushers in more durable and peaceful democracies and is more successful in removing authoritarian regimes than violent struggle. It is not enough simply to pray. There are solutions to many of the problems we face; new mechanisms for dialogue need to be created, along with systems of education to inculcate moral values. These must be grounded in the perspective that we all belong to one human family and that together we can take action to address global challenges. It is encouraging that we have seen many ordinary people across the world displaying great compassion toward the plight of refugees, from those who have rescued them from the sea, to those who have taken them in and provided friendship and support. As a refugee myself, I feel a strong empathy for their situation and when we see their anguish, we should do all we can to help them. I can also understand the fears of people in host countries, who may feel overwhelmed. The combination of circumstances draws attention to the vital importance of collective action toward restoring genuine peace to the lands these refugees are fleeing. Tibetan refugees have firsthand experience of living through such circumstances and, although we have not yet been able to return to our homeland, we are grateful for the humanitarian support we have received through the decades from friends, including the people of the United States. A further source for hope is the genuine cooperation among the world's nations toward a common goal evident in the Paris accord on climate change. When global warming threatens the health of this planet that is our only home, it is only by considering the larger global interest that local and national interests will be met. I have a personal connection to this issue because Tibet is the world's highest plateau and is an epicenter of global climate change, warming nearly three times as fast as the rest of the world. It is the largest repository of water outside the two poles and the source of the Earth's most extensive river system, critical to the world's 10 most densely populated nations. To find solutions to the environmental crisis and violent conflicts that confront us in the 21st century, we need to seek new answers. Even though I am a Buddhist monk, I believe that these solutions lie beyond religion in the promotion of a concept I call secular ethics. This is an approach to educating ourselves based on scientific findings, common experience and common sense--a more universal approach to the promotion of our shared human values. Over more than three decades, my discussions with scientists, educators and social workers from across the globe have revealed common concerns. As a result we have developed a system that incorporates an education of the heart, but one that is based on study of the workings of the mind and emotions through scholarship and scientific research rather than religious practice. Since we need moral principles--compassion, respect for others, kindness, taking responsibility--in every field of human activity, we are working to help schools and colleges create opportunities for young people to develop greater self-awareness, to learn how to manage destructive emotions and cultivate social skills. Such training is being incorporated into the curriculum of many schools in North America and Europe--I am involved with work at Emory University on a new curriculum on secular ethics that is being introduced in several schools in India and the United States. [[Page H3748]] It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the 21st century does not repeat the pain and bloodshed of the past. Because human nature is basically compassionate, I believe it is possible that decades from now we will see an era of peace--but we must work together as global citizens of a shared planet. Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by way of welcoming the Dalai Lama, I would like to say a few words about him and his leadership. The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, describes himself as a simple Buddhist monk. He was recognized as the reincarnation of the previous 13th Dalai Lama when he was only 2 years old, and he was only 6 when he began his monastic studies. But years before he finished his education, when he was still a teenager, he was called upon to assume full political power after China's invasion of Tibet in 1950. When in 1954 he went to Beijing for peace talks with Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders, he was not yet 20. Five years later, with the brutal suppression of the Tibetan national uprising in Lhasa by Chinese troops, the Dalai Lama was forced to escape into exile. Since 1959, he has been living in northern India. That is more than 60 years of exile. I have had the opportunity to meet the Dalai Lama on a number of occasions. He is a warm, generous, compassionate man with a great sense of humor. He is also a man of peace. He has consistently advocated for policies of nonviolence even in the face of extreme aggression. In 1989, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent struggle for the liberation of Tibet. He has received over 150 awards, honorary doctorates, and prizes in recognition of his message of peace, nonviolence, interreligious understanding, universal responsibility, and compassion. His is a voice for tolerance. Unfortunately, as we all know, Tibet has not been liberated. In the late 1990s, under the Dalai Lama's leadership, the Tibetan people formally put aside the goal of independence. Since then, they have been fighting, peacefully, for their autonomy within China; but that struggle is not going very well today. Part of the reason it is not going very well is that the international community seems to be more interested in not offending China than in vigorously supporting the human rights of the Tibetan people. It seems to me that my own government has fallen into that trap. I am looking forward to the Dalai Lama's visit this week, and I know that the leadership of the House and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will welcome him with the greatest appreciation; but it is easy to praise the Dalai Lama, to meet with him, and to benefit from his teachings, yet not lift a finger to help the people of Tibet. The Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people deserve better. Madam Speaker, last November I had the honor of joining Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and my colleagues Joyce Beatty, Ted Lieu, Alan Lowenthal, Betty McCollum, and Tim Walz on a historic congressional delegation to Tibet, Beijing, and Hong Kong. I have long raised concerns about China's human rights record in Tibet. As the first congressional delegation to enter Tibet since the 2008 unrest, our trip was an important opportunity to raise the voices of the Tibetan people, and we did just that. Everywhere we went, in every meeting we had, we talked about Tibet. We talked about the Dalai Lama and his strong bipartisan support in Congress. We talked about the importance of respect for people's cultures and religions, and we talked about the need to strengthen and protect all of the human rights of the Tibetan people. During the delegation visit, we felt we had a good exchange with Chinese officials and, especially, with university students both in Tibet and in Beijing. We saw our trip--and especially the delegation's visit to Tibet--as an important gesture by the Chinese Government; but it was also clear to us that our visit was only a first step and that much more needed to be done. Since our return, we have been looking for ways to build on our visit and to advance the reforms needed for meaningful change. Here are some of the things we identified that need to happen specifically with regard to Tibet: The United States needs to open a consulate in Lhasa, Tibet; More Members of Congress, more journalists, more members of parliament from other nations, and more people in general, including members of the Tibetan community here in the United States, need to be allowed to travel freely to Tibet; Tibetans in China need to be able to travel freely as well; The dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama to resolve longstanding issues of Tibetan autonomy, religious practice, culture, language, and heritage needs to be renewed. I came away from our visit believing even more strongly that the Dalai Lama is part of the solution to resolving Tibetan grievances. Too often during our trip, we heard from some Chinese officials--not all, but some--expressions and characterizations of Tibet and the Dalai Lama that showed that some people's minds and imaginations are stuck in the past, in old prejudices. This concerned me greatly. The issue is not the past. The issue is the future of Tibet and its people. Renewing dialogue must be genuine and productive, and it cannot be just another guise for wasting time or going through the motions. We need to see a dialogue based on good faith and on the mutual need to resolve outstanding issues in a way that is acceptable to all parties. Undertaking such an initiative would be a positive reflection on the capacity of Chinese authorities to engage in constructive dialogue, and it would increase confidence the world over that the government is committed to reconciliation and ending abuses in Tibet. The Chinese Government has invested a great deal in Tibet, and that was very clear to us, but that investment must not come at the price of an entire culture. You cannot confine a people's culture and heritage-- their very sense of identity--to a museum or to a market of handicrafts. The human rights of the Tibetan people must be strengthened and protected, and I returned from the delegation visit with a renewed commitment to continue to work with my colleagues in Congress, with Leader Pelosi, to push for the reforms that are needed to achieve this, and this is the reason we are here today. Madam Speaker, I yield to our distinguished Democratic leader, who led this historic visit to Tibet, Leader Pelosi. Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for calling this Special Order this evening. Special it is, indeed, as we welcome His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, to Washington, D.C. Tomorrow, in a bipartisan way, House and Senate Democrats and Republicans will join in welcoming His Holiness. He is among one of the things we all agree on--his greatness and the honor he brings us with his visit. Madam Speaker, I completely associate myself with every word of Mr. McGovern's comments. He talked about our visit to Lhasa, to Tibet, and to other places in China. We called him Mr. McGovern's spiritual leader of our visit. As the co-chair of the Lantos Human Rights Commission of the House of Representatives, he truly believes, as His Holiness says and as I heard him say today, that we are all God's children, and that is how we have to treat each other. In listening to our colleagues of the previous Special Order, who were members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who discussed various issues of justice--social justice, health justice, and the rest--and who talked about Orlando, it focuses on how special His Holiness' visit is. In coming the day after the terrible massacre of many in the LGBT community, it is really something that should be a comfort to all of us. His Holiness' message of peace, of compassion, of respect for every person is a message of hope that is needed today, tomorrow, and the next day, which are the days His Holiness will be here, but it is needed as we go forward as well. He is a truly great man. When I awoke this morning so sad about what happened yesterday, I was full of hope about hearing what His Holiness would have to say about our responsibilities to each other. Our colleague mentioned our November CODEL. It was something that many of us had been hoping to do for many years. We had been trying for 25 years to get a visa to visit Tibet, and [[Page H3749]] the President of China gave us that opportunity. We went there to see, to learn, to observe, and to make judgments. We did not go there to burn bridges; we went there to build bridges. As Congressman McGovern said, we saw some areas in which we could work together, and we came back with some resolve, hopefully, to get other bridge building done. I have seen His Holiness on many occasions. When he first came to Congress, I was brand new in Congress. He came under the auspices of Mr. Lantos, for whom the Human Rights Commission is named, and he brought us together in a group to listen to His Holiness' plan of action. It included respect for the environment and autonomy for Tibet but not independence. That was over 25 years ago that he had been talking about autonomy. While sometimes the Chinese Government doesn't accept that characterization, it is why many of us support His Holiness. As I mentioned earlier, he has friends on both sides of the aisle on both sides of the Capitol and also down Pennsylvania Avenue. I remember with great pride when we presented His Holiness with a Congressional Gold Medal--again, with great bipartisan support. President Bush came. Not only that--and a bigger honor yet--Mrs. Laura Bush came as well. What an honor for His Holiness and what an honor for our country that our President showed that respect. On that day when we talked about it, we had so many good things to say about His Holiness. One of the things was his unstinting support for peace as a positive example of how to make the world a better place--peace in the world, peace in our country, peace in our communities, peace in our families, peace in ourselves. That inner peace is what he has been preaching. On this trip, we can see His Holiness as he embodies the wisdom and the courage to maintain what he calls a peaceful mind in a modern world, and we look forward to hearing what he has to say about that. In addition to saying we are all God's children and of the respect we need to have for each other and of the compassion that he advocates, His Holiness says that great changes start with individuals. I will tell this story, which, I think, some may find amusing. His Holiness is a gentle man. While he has big challenges and while he is the leader and the champion in the advocacy--I wouldn't use the word ``fight'' as he doesn't like words like that--for respecting the culture, the language, and the religion of the Tibetan people and the autonomy for them as a people, he does so in a very gentle way. I met him here in the Capitol for the first time, and I saw him in Rio at the time of the Earth Summit in 1992, where he spoke as a religious leader. We also acknowledged that he was the first winner of the Nobel Prize--it was part of his proclamation and why he won--for his contribution in protecting the environment. It was the first environmental consideration in a Nobel Prize. How beautiful that was. I have seen him here many times, in California, in New York--you name it--and in Dharamsala, which is where he lives in India. Anyway, we were taking a delegation there to visit--a bipartisan, large delegation to visit him there. {time} 2100 And we saw some of the people right after the crackdown in Tibet-- coincidentally, we had our trip planned for a long time, but it happened to occur right after that crackdown. So many people were coming in from Tibet telling us what they saw there. It was pretty brutal, the reports that they gave us, and it was so sad. So later in the day, when we had lunch with the couple hundred lamas from all over India, that part of India, many of them Tibetan Buddhist lamas, I explained what I had seen that morning and how transformative it was to see people get firsthand knowledge of the humanity of man and that we had to do something about it. We had our Members there. One was going to help with this, and one was going to help with that. You know, there were all these things that we were going to do to help these people. And then I said what I always said: if freedom-loving people do not speak out against oppression in Tibet because of our commercial interests with China, then we surrender all moral authority to speak on behalf of human rights anywhere in the world. Tibet remains a challenge to the conscience of the world, and we must respond to that. When I was finished, His Holiness spoke to the lamas there, and he said to the lamas: Now, let us all pray so that we could rid Nancy of her negative attitudes. Well, I thought I was making the fight, but I am not going to be holier than His Holiness. A gentle approach is what he thinks is best and respectful. I take some level of pride in telling our Chinese friends--and they are our friends. He is your friend, too, in terms of damping down any, shall we say, exuberance when we learn what we consider to be grave injustices and human rights violations. In honor of His Holiness' 80th birthday last summer--Richard Gere is the chairman of the International Campaign for Tibet and has really been a champion for His Holiness and the Tibetan people--Richard Gere and I wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed, and in it we said there is no better way to honor the Dalai Lama than by standing with him and the Tibetan people vowing to keep their cause alive. It is a beautiful culture, indeed. To hear His Holiness, as I did today, speak in Tibetan, which I didn't understand except through translation, and have him explain that the Tibetan language is a beautiful language in specifics, in terms of explaining Buddhism and matters of faith and philosophy because of its intricacies. It enhances your appreciation and understanding of Buddhism to hear it in the words of the Tibetan language, and translated from Tibetan in terms of the intricacies of the language that you would need to translate it into English or another language. So this language is important to the faith of Buddhism. It is important to the culture. It is important to the families. It is important, again, to the education of the children. And the attempts on the part of the Chinese to resettle Han Chinese, dilute the population of Tibetans in Tibet, is something that would be just really wrong, just plain and simple wrong. Again, it is a challenge to the conscience. This morning, His Holiness spoke at the United States Institute of Peace, and he said real change comes through action. He said: You all ask me for my blessing, and people say nice things, but real change comes through action. If I understood it correctly in the translation, he said that karma is not necessarily just about fate. It is about acting, action, taking action. So we all need to take action in what we believe in. Again, every opportunity I get--and I thank the distinguished gentleman, the conscience of our codel and chair of the Tom Lantos Commission on Human Rights. Every opportunity I get, and this is one of them that I treasure on the floor of the House, to say what an honor it is to even be in the same room, the same place with His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, a revered figure throughout the world. The Dalai Lama's name is synonymous with everything that is good, and that is what we emphasized to our Chinese host. We had to move, as Mr. McGovern said, beyond their outmoded thinking into another place. In terms of His Holiness, tomorrow when he comes to the Capitol, I will look forward to thanking him for his tremendous, inspiring leadership. ``Inspiration'' is such an inadequate word when it comes to what he is. We thank him for sharing the strength of his determination in pursuit of peace. He was speaking about it today in terms of something that might take some years. We may not see it, some of us--you might, Mr. McGovern; I might not--a time when the world was completely at peace. When he laughs, it is something very special. We hear the joyousness that transcends despair. In his words, we receive a message of hope and humanity when he is with us. In his presence, we feel inspired to make a difference, to make a difference in ourselves and in our world. I talked earlier about President Bush coming to the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony, and I know that the President will be receiving His Holiness this week. Presidents have done that over time, which is a source of great pride for us in our country and in [[Page H3750]] the relationship between His Holiness and our President. But it goes a long way back. I will just close by saying, when His Holiness was a very little boy and he became the Dalai Lama, he received a gift from the President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt; and he loved it because it was a watch, and the watch had the phases of the Moon. Actually, my Apple watch has the phases of the Sun. The watch had the phases of the Moon, and how prescient President Franklin Roosevelt was to send this little boy this watch, who would become so interested in science and thinking and the brain and faith and what the connection was among all of those factors. But again, the relationship between an American President and His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, goes back to when he was a little boy, and it persists into his eighties now. That is something that, again, brings luster to us in our country that we have such a beautiful relationship with such a spiritual figure in the world. So I look forward to welcoming him here tomorrow. Again, as I said to him today: You could not have come at a better time when we are so in mourning about what happened in Orlando to our LGBT loved ones, to their families, to the community in Orlando. We are grateful to the response of our first responders there and our law enforcement officials and local officials there. Again, it is the spirituality that we need to recover and draw strength to go forward to make sure that we minimize any such actions that hopefully they never happen again. How wonderful that His Holiness is here to bring us that comfort. With that, I am pleased and with great gratitude to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for being such a champion of human rights throughout the world. He and Mr. Pitts, his Republican counterpart, as co-chairs of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, do a great service to our Congress and to our country. They honor our values, the respect for the dignity and worth of every person, recognizing that we are all God's children. We all have a spark of divinity in us, and they always are speaking truth to power. I thank them for their commitment and for their courage, and to you, Mr. McGovern, for calling this Special Order today. Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished leader for being here, and I appreciate her leadership on this issue and her leadership on human rights issues. One of the things that compels us to be here today is our continued concern about the human rights situation for the Tibetan people. And whether it is the latest annual report from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom or whether it is the U.S. State Department's most recent human rights report, or almost any other report, quite frankly, by any major world respected human rights organization, we see that the conditions for the Tibetan people really are quite dire. The Human Rights Watch report, entitled, ``Relentless'' talks about the detention and prosecution of Tibetans from 2013 to 2015 under China's ``stability maintenance'' campaign. The report is based on 479 cases of Tibetans detained or tried for political expression or criticism of government policy. Human Rights Watch only included cases on which its staff was able to obtain credible information. One important source was the terrific database on political prisoners in China that was maintained by the Congressional Executive Commission on China. Without going into a lot of details, let me just highlight a couple of takeaways. Tibetans are now being detained for activities that used to be considered minor offences or not politically sensitive. Many of those detained and prosecuted come from parts of society not previously known for dissent: local community leaders, environmental activists, and villagers involved in social and cultural activities, as well as local writers and singers. I can go on and on and on. I include into the Record the Human Rights Watch report, entitled, ``Relentless,'' Madam Speaker. Relentless: Detention and Prosecution of Tibetans Under China's ``Stability Maintenance'' Campaign Summary We have followed the law in striking out and relentlessly pounding at illegal organizations and key figures, and resolutely followed the law in striking at the illegal organizations and key figures who follow the 14th Dalai Lama clique in carrying out separatist, infiltration, and sabotage activities, knocking out the hidden dangers and soil for undermining Tibet's stability, and effectively safeguarding the state's utmost interests [and] society's overall interests.--Statement by Chen Quanguo, Tibet Autonomous Region Party Secretary, December 2013 This report documents the Chinese government's detention, prosecution, and conviction of Tibetans for largely peaceful activities from 2013 to 2015. Our research shows diminishing tolerance by authorities for forms of expression and assembly protected under international law. This has been marked by an increase in state control over daily life, increasing criminalization of nonviolent forms of protest, and at times disproportionate responses to local protests. These measures, part of a policy known as weiwen or ``stability maintenance,'' have led authorities to expand the range of activities and issues targeted for repression in Tibetan areas, particularly in the countryside. The analysis presented here is based on our assessment of 479 cases for which we were able to obtain credible information. All cases are of Tibetans detained or tried from 2013 to 2015 for political expression or criticism of government policy--``political offenses.'' Our cases paint a detailed picture not available elsewhere. Stringent limitations on access to Tibet and on information flows out of Tibet mean we cannot conclude definitively that our cases are representative of the unknown overall number of political detentions of Tibetans during this period. But they are indicative of the profound impact stability maintenance'' policies have had in those areas, and of shifts in the types of protest and protester Chinese authorities are targeting there. Information on the cases comes from the Chinese government, exile organizations, and foreign media. Of the 479 detainees, 153 were reported to have been sent for trial, convicted, and sentenced to imprisonment. The average sentence they received was 5.7 years in prison. As explained in the methodology section below, the actual number of Tibetans detained and prosecuted during this period for political offenses was likely significantly higher. Many detentions documented here were for activities that the Chinese authorities previously considered to be minor offenses or not politically sensitive. Many of those detained came from segments of society not previously associated with dissent. In addition, many of the detentions took place in rural areas where political activity had not previously been reported. From 2008 to 2012, the Tibetan parts of Sichuan province had posted the highest numbers of protests and detentions on the Tibetan plateau, but in 2013 the epicenter of detentions shifted to the central and western areas of the Tibetan plateau, called the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) since 1965, which until 1950 had been under the government of the Dalai Lama. Our research found that many of those detained and prosecuted were local community leaders, environmental activists, and villagers involved in social and cultural activities, as well as local writers and singers. In the previous three decades, the authorities had rarely accused people from these sectors of Tibetan society of involvement in political unrest. Buddhist monks and nuns, who constituted over 90 percent of political detainees in Tibet in the 1980s, represent less than 40 percent of the 479 cases documented here. Almost all the protests and detentions identified in this report occurred in small towns or rural townships and villages rather than in cities, where most protests and detentions in prior years were reported to have taken place. This suggests that dissent has increased in rural Tibetan areas, where nearly 80 percent of Tibetans live. Our data also shows an overall decline in the total number of Tibetans detained for political offenses between 2013 and 2015, though this may be an artifact of the limitations on information, detailed in the methodology section below. Notably, however, the totals for these three years are significantly higher than for the 10 years before 2008 when stability maintenance policies were expanded following major protests centered in Lhasa (Ch.: Lasa), the capital of the TAR. The changing nature of unrest and politicized detention in Tibet correlates with new phases in the stability maintenance campaign in the TAR and other Tibetan areas. Since 2011, authorities have intensified social control and surveillance at the grassroots level, particularly in the rural areas of the TAR. This has included the transfer of some 21,000 officials to villages and monasteries in the TAR, where they are tasked with implementing new management, security, and propaganda operations, and, more recently, the deployment of nearly 10,000 police in Tibetan villages in Qinghai. This has led to a surge in the creation of local Communist Party organizations, government offices, police posts, security patrols, and political organizations in Tibetan villages and towns, particularly in the TAR. The implementation of these measures appears to explain many of the new patterns of detention, prosecution, and sentencing documented in this report. It was only after the [[Page H3751]] rural phase of the stability maintenance policy in the TAR was implemented from late 2011 that the number of protests and resulting detentions and convictions increased dramatically in that region. These detentions, occurring primarily in rural areas, indicate that the stability maintenance policy in the TAR has entered a third phase. The first phase entailed paramilitary operations in the immediate wake of the 2008 protests in Lhasa, when the authorities detained several thousand people suspected of involvement in those protests or associated rioting. The second phase, which began in late 2011 and is ongoing, involved the transfer of officials to run security and propaganda operations in villages, as described above. The third phase, which dates to early 2013, has involved increasing use of the surveillance and security mechanisms established during the second phase in rural villages of the TAR to single out activities deemed to be precursors of unrest. This has meant that formerly anodyne activities have become the focus of state attention and punishment, including social activities by villagers that had not previously been put under sustained scrutiny by the security forces. In the eastern Tibetan areas--comprising parts of Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, and Yunnan provinces--politicized detentions also appear to correlate with stability maintenance measures. But in these areas, the government's measures have been aimed primarily at stopping self-immolations by Tibetans protesting Chinese rule, most of which have taken place in the eastern areas. Beginning in December 2012 the authorities there conducted an intensified drive to end self-immolations among Tibetans that resulted in a sharp increase in detentions and prosecutions of Tibetans for alleged connections to self- immolations, often with tenuous legal basis. The government's introduction of grassroots stability maintenance mechanisms in the TAR and of measures against self-immolation in the eastern areas, including in many previously quiet rural areas, has resulted in certain Tibetan localities becoming sites of repeated protests and detentions, producing what could be called protest ``cluster sites,'' previously unseen in Tibetan areas. These localities saw greater numbers of politicized detentions, recurrent cycles of protest and detention, higher average sentencing rates compared to other areas, and longer sentences for relatively minor offenses. During 2013-2015, lay and religious leaders of rural communities often received unusually heavy sentences for expressions of dissent, especially if they were from a protest cluster site. Having a sensitive image or text on one's cellphone or computer could also lead to a long prison sentence, especially though not only if it had been sent to other people. Among those who received the longest sentences were people who tried to assist victims of self-immolations, leaders of protests against mining or government construction projects, and organizers of village opposition to unpopular decisions by local officials. Such activities, most of which were not explicitly political and did not directly challenge the legitimacy of the state, received markedly longer sentences than people shouting slogans or distributing leaflets in support of Tibetan independence. The incidents described in this report indicate that outbursts of unrest and waves of politicized detentions occurred in specific localities at certain times rather than being evenly dispersed across the Tibetan areas. But the range of locations and the different social levels of protesters involved suggest that political, environmental, and cultural discontent is widespread among Tibetans in many parts of the plateau. Deaths and ill-health of detainees also continued to be a serious problem in the period covered by this study. Fourteen of those detained, 2.9 percent of the total, were reported to have died in custody or shortly after release, allegedly as a result of mistreatment. The cases also involve the detention of children, including a 14 and a 15-year-old, both monks, and at least one 11-year- old child detained after his father self-immolated. The detentions, prosecutions, and convictions documented here reflect the impact of intensive new efforts by officials in Tibetan areas to prevent any repeat of the Tibet-wide protests that occurred in the spring of 2008. Yet the new policies have led to apparently unprecedented cycles of discontent in certain rural areas, and an overall increase in the types of activities that are treated as criminal challenges to the authority of the Communist Party or the Chinese state. The failure of the central government and local authorities to end these abusive policies and roll back intrusive security and surveillance measures raises the prospect of an intensified cycle of repression and resistance in a region already enduring extraordinary restrictions on basic human rights. Recommendations To the Government of China Unconditionally release from custody all persons detained without charge or convicted for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and belief, or for other conduct protected by international human rights law. Allow independent observers--including journalists, human rights monitors, and United Nations special procedures-- unimpeded access to all areas covered by the ``stability maintenance'' campaign to verify the extent of human rights violations stemming from the campaign's implementation. Ensure that all persons taken into custody have immediate access to lawyers and family members. Those taken into custody should be released unless promptly brought before a court and charged with an offense. End the collective punishment of community members for the actions, criminal or not, of local leaders or other members of their community. Conduct credible, transparent, and impartial investigations into all incidents from 2013 to 2015 that resulted in alleged extrajudicial killings, or alleged torture or other ill- treatment in custody. Make the findings of those investigations public and fairly prosecute anyone responsible for such abuses. Conduct credible, transparent, and impartial investigations into arbitrary detentions and deaths stemming from the March 2008 protests in Lhasa and across Tibetan areas. End interference by officials, party representatives, and the security forces in monasteries and other religious institutions. To the United Nations The UN secretary-general should urge China to honor the offer it made before the Human Rights Council in March 2009 to invite the UN high commissioner for human rights ``at a time mutually convenient to both sides.'' The UN high commissioner for human rights should specifically request to visit the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Tibetan Autonomous Areas in Qinghai and Sichuan provinces. The UN high commissioner for human rights, as well as the special rapporteurs and working groups on torture, enforced disappearances, and independence of judges and lawyers, should reiterate their requests to visit the region to assess the human rights situation. To Concerned Governments Urge the Chinese government to implement the following measures in Tibetan areas: provide information on all persons detained in connection with protests; end arbitrary detention and torture and other ill-treatment in detention; impartially investigate the use of excessive or lethal force by the security forces; and discipline or prosecute as appropriate members of the security forces implicated in serious abuses. Extend full and active support to the international investigation into the Tibetan protests led by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Urge the Chinese government to review the official policies and practices in Tibetan areas that have contributed to unrest. Speak out, when cooperating with China on law enforcement or counterterrorism efforts, against the use of trumped-up public order and terrorism allegations to persecute or curtail the human rights of ethnic groups. Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, this Congress has weighed in many times and in many ways on United States policy concerning Tibet. One of the most significant things we did was to approve the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, which is supposed to guide U.S. Government policy. It encourages dialogue between the Chinese Government and representatives of the Dalai Lama, and it created the post of Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues within the Department of State. Last July, in recognition of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama's 80th birthday, the House approved H. Res. 337, which cited the Tibetan Policy Act. In that resolution, Congress strongly encouraged the Government of the People's Republic of China and His Holiness to hold substantive dialogue, without preconditions, in order to address Tibetan grievances and secure a negotiated agreement for the Tibetan people. We also called for the establishment of a U.S. consulate in Lhasa. We urged the immediate and unconditional release of Tibetan political prisoners, including the 11th Panchen Lama, and Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, a Tibetan monk who tragically and unnecessarily died in Chinese custody shortly after. We called on the United States Government to underscore that any government's interference in the Tibetan reincarnation process is a violation of the internationally recognized right to religious freedom. We called upon the Government of China to allow U.S. officials and journalists and other citizens unrestricted access to Tibetan areas of China, as we allow Chinese officials and citizens access to the United States' territory. We asked that the United States and international governments, organizations, and civil society renew and reinforce initiatives to promote the preservation of the distinct religious, cultural, linguistic, and national identity of the Tibetan people. We urged the United States to use its voice and vote to encourage development organizations and agencies to design and implement development [[Page H3752]] projects that fully comply with the Tibet Project principles. These principles are meant to ensure that the needs of the Tibetan people guide all development in Tibetan areas; that their projects respect Tibetan culture, traditions, knowledge, and wisdom; and that the development initiatives neither provide incentives for nor facilitate the migration and settlement of non-Tibetans into Tibet, nor the transfer of ownership of Tibetan land or natural resources to non- Tibetans. All of these recommendations for what the United States Government should be doing are just as valid today as they were last year because very little progress has been made in the last year. I say ``very little'' because we have acknowledged the important gesture China made in allowing last fall's codel to travel to Tibet, but that is about all that has happened, and the Dalai Lama is about to be a year older. If we are not going to get moving on those longstanding recommendations, let me suggest some other things we could try. We could start a campaign to get China to allow the Dalai Lama to return to Tibet. Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state and, two, everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country. It is time to let the Dalai Lama return to his country. This House could pass a bill that I introduced, the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act, basically saying that, if the Chinese Government restricts U.S. officials and U.S. citizens access to Tibet, then we should consider limiting the access of Chinese officials when they visit the United States. We could make sure that the U.S. Government invites the Dalai Lama to every event on every occasion where his decades of knowledge, experience, and reflections would be helpful for addressing the world's problems. The Dalai Lama is a world spiritual and philosophical leader who should be contributing to global debates on countering violent extremism and on fostering peace in war-torn countries. These are just a couple of topics on which I am convinced we could all benefit from his wisdom. We could insist that Tibet be part of our climate change discussions with China. Climate change is one of the few topics on which the U.S. and China have found common ground. It is a critically important topic for Tibet, given its fragile environment and its critically important reserves of freshwater. Tibet is warming three times as fast as the rest of the world, but it is absent from the global climate change debate. {time} 2115 The Chinese leadership has acknowledged at the highest levels the scale of the environmental crisis it faces. Conserving the Tibetan Plateau is surely a shared interest, and it can only be achieved with the full participation of the Tibetan people. It is time to rally around some of these ideas or to find others. It is time to do something different on Tibet. It is time for us to think differently and to think out of the box on ways that we can advance dialogue with China, not in a confrontational way, but in ways to get China to understand the importance of recognizing the human rights of the Tibetan people and recognizing the importance of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and allowing him to return to his homeland. Madam Speaker, many of my colleagues wanted to be here today to speak on this. I include the statements of the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) in the Record. Last week the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) submitted their statements to the Record. In closing, again, I would urge all of my colleagues to join with the leader and myself in welcoming His Holiness the Dalai Lama to Washington, D.C., to the United States, wishing him good health and praying that reconciliation between the Tibetan people and the Chinese Government happens very, very soon. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I believe that the U.S. must remain committed to defending human rights and personal freedoms both within the U.S. and abroad. As our country continues to advance U.S.-China relations, we must never forget the people of Tibet. Restrictions on human rights and religious freedom in Tibet have been a growing concern to many. As a member of the Congressional Executive Committee on China, I share this concern. While Chinese investments have undoubtedly helped to modernize Tibet, these investments must not come at the expense of the rich cultural, linguistic, and religious heritage of the Tibetan people. We must continue to support the protection of traditional Tibetan culture. As you may know, I had the opportunity to be one of the first groups of Americans to travel to China and teach Chinese high school students in 1989. During that trip, I also traveled to Tibet in 1990 and, most recently, I have returned as a member of the Congressional Delegation visiting China and Tibet. The boosted economic growth, higher household incomes, and constructed railway projects have facilitated the rapid modernization of the Tibet Autonomous Region. However, we need to continue to have constructive dialogues with China to ensure the preservation of traditional Tibetan culture and Tibet's fragile ecology. The Congressional Delegation trip to Tibet provided an opportunity to have a healthy dialogue, and I want to thank our Chinese friends for engaging with us in a discussion over the most sensitive issues concerning Tibet. As a southern Minnesotan, I understand the importance of spurring economic growth while simultaneously protecting natural wonders and culture. With this in mind, I believe that Tibetans must receive the necessary rights that will allow them to protect their culture, language, religion, and environment. The U.S. was founded on the ideas of universal freedom, and I believe that we must continue to urge the Chinese government to provide less regulated religious freedom to the Tibetans. I strongly believe that a critical step to achieving religious freedom in Tibet is including the Dalai Lama in future dialogues. I have had the pleasure of meeting His Holiness on three occasions, and I share his desire to preserve Tibetan culture and resolve other issues concerning Tibet. Lastly, I encourage the Chinese government to agree to establish a U.S. Consulate in the Tibetan city of Lhasa because I believe diplomacy and talking through our concerns and partnerships under the lens of transparency can only strengthen the relationship between our two countries. I will continue to support attempts to have productive dialogues with the Chinese government concerning the future of Tibet. Improvements in the quality of life, access to clean water, and access to health care services in Tibet must also include efforts to preserve the Tibetan way of life. Mr. CAPUANO. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to His Holiness the Dalai Lama. He has come to Washington to be present when the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) awards its Democracy Service Medal posthumously to another heroic spiritual leader, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, who died in captivity in China in July of last year. The NED will also honor the Central Tibetan Administration, based in Dharamshala, India, for its commitment to freedom and democracy. It is fitting, too, as Prime Minister Nahrendra Modi concludes his visit, to recognize the generosity India has shown to exiles seeking political and religious liberty within its borders. With His Holiness and with all Tibetans, we grieve for all they have endured since the Chinese invasion, the sorrows of those who live in exile and the sufferings of those who remain. I am outraged that oppression and murder continue unabated. With His Holiness and with Tenzin Delek Rinpoche's cousin Geshe Nyima, representing his bereaved family, we mourn the shameful persecution and tragic death of a man committed to nonviolence. I urge the House to approve H. Res 584, urging President Obama to seek an independent investigation of his death and to call publicly for an end to the repressive policies of the People's Republic of China in Tibet. It has been in committee for many months. Elie Wiesel, like His Holiness awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, exhorts us: There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest. Indeed, we do protest, and further we should never cease to hold oppressors accountable. The people of Tibet, inspired by the Dalai Lama, continue to cherish their culture and traditions. I wish them all his faith and courage, today, tomorrow and every day until Tibet is free. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [House] [Pages H3747-H3752] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 2045 TIBET The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. McSally). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 30 minutes. General Leave Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks and to enter additional materials into the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, this week, Washington, D.C., is blessed by the presence of His Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, who is visiting the city from June 12 through June 16 for several events and meetings. This visit provides us not only the opportunity to listen to the Dalai Lama speak about the modern world and confronting conflict, but also to take a look at the crisis that faces Tibet and the Tibetan people and ask why the United States is not doing more to protect the rights and to support the autonomy of the Tibetan people. As we seek to comprehend the senseless violence of yesterday's massacre of at least 49 people in Orlando, Florida, and the wounding of more than 50 others--most members of the LGBT community and many of Hispanic descent, all just enjoying their lives on a Saturday night--I can think of no better source of words of wisdom, tolerance, and peace than of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an opinion piece by the Dalai Lama, entitled: ``The Dalai Lama: Why I'm hopeful about the world's future.'' [From the Washington Post, June 13, 2016] The Dalai Lama: Why I'm Hopeful About the World's Future (By the Dalai Lama) The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the spiritual leader of Tibet. Since 1959, he has lived in exile in Dharamsala in northern India. Almost six decades have passed since I left my homeland, Tibet, and became a refugee. Thanks to the kindness of the government and people of India, we Tibetans found a second home where we could live in dignity and freedom, able to keep our language, culture and Buddhist traditions alive. My generation has witnessed so much violence--some historians estimate that more than 200 million people were killed in conflicts in the 20th century. Today, there is no end in sight to the horrific violence in the Middle East, which in the case of Syria has led to the greatest refugee crisis in a generation. Appalling terrorist attacks--as we were sadly reminded this weekend--have created deep-seated fear. While it would be easy to feel a sense of hopelessness and despair, it is all the more necessary in the early years of the 21st century to be realistic and optimistic. There are many reasons for us to be hopeful. Recognition of universal human rights, including the right to self- determination, has expanded beyond anything imagined a century ago. There is growing international consensus in support of gender equality and respect for women. Particularly among the younger generation, there is a widespread rejection of war as a means of solving problems. Across the world, many are doing valuable work to prevent terrorism, recognizing the depths of misunderstanding and the divisive idea of ``us'' and ``them'' that is so dangerous. Significant reductions in the world's arsenal of nuclear weapons mean that setting a timetable for further reductions and ultimately the elimination of nuclear weapons--a sentiment President Obama recently reiterated in Hiroshima, Japan--no longer seem a mere dream. The notion of absolute victory for one side and defeat of another is thoroughly outdated; in some situations, following conflict, suffering arises from a state that cannot be described as either war or peace. Violence inevitably incurs further violence. Indeed, history has shown that nonviolent resistance ushers in more durable and peaceful democracies and is more successful in removing authoritarian regimes than violent struggle. It is not enough simply to pray. There are solutions to many of the problems we face; new mechanisms for dialogue need to be created, along with systems of education to inculcate moral values. These must be grounded in the perspective that we all belong to one human family and that together we can take action to address global challenges. It is encouraging that we have seen many ordinary people across the world displaying great compassion toward the plight of refugees, from those who have rescued them from the sea, to those who have taken them in and provided friendship and support. As a refugee myself, I feel a strong empathy for their situation and when we see their anguish, we should do all we can to help them. I can also understand the fears of people in host countries, who may feel overwhelmed. The combination of circumstances draws attention to the vital importance of collective action toward restoring genuine peace to the lands these refugees are fleeing. Tibetan refugees have firsthand experience of living through such circumstances and, although we have not yet been able to return to our homeland, we are grateful for the humanitarian support we have received through the decades from friends, including the people of the United States. A further source for hope is the genuine cooperation among the world's nations toward a common goal evident in the Paris accord on climate change. When global warming threatens the health of this planet that is our only home, it is only by considering the larger global interest that local and national interests will be met. I have a personal connection to this issue because Tibet is the world's highest plateau and is an epicenter of global climate change, warming nearly three times as fast as the rest of the world. It is the largest repository of water outside the two poles and the source of the Earth's most extensive river system, critical to the world's 10 most densely populated nations. To find solutions to the environmental crisis and violent conflicts that confront us in the 21st century, we need to seek new answers. Even though I am a Buddhist monk, I believe that these solutions lie beyond religion in the promotion of a concept I call secular ethics. This is an approach to educating ourselves based on scientific findings, common experience and common sense--a more universal approach to the promotion of our shared human values. Over more than three decades, my discussions with scientists, educators and social workers from across the globe have revealed common concerns. As a result we have developed a system that incorporates an education of the heart, but one that is based on study of the workings of the mind and emotions through scholarship and scientific research rather than religious practice. Since we need moral principles--compassion, respect for others, kindness, taking responsibility--in every field of human activity, we are working to help schools and colleges create opportunities for young people to develop greater self-awareness, to learn how to manage destructive emotions and cultivate social skills. Such training is being incorporated into the curriculum of many schools in North America and Europe--I am involved with work at Emory University on a new curriculum on secular ethics that is being introduced in several schools in India and the United States. [[Page H3748]] It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the 21st century does not repeat the pain and bloodshed of the past. Because human nature is basically compassionate, I believe it is possible that decades from now we will see an era of peace--but we must work together as global citizens of a shared planet. Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by way of welcoming the Dalai Lama, I would like to say a few words about him and his leadership. The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, describes himself as a simple Buddhist monk. He was recognized as the reincarnation of the previous 13th Dalai Lama when he was only 2 years old, and he was only 6 when he began his monastic studies. But years before he finished his education, when he was still a teenager, he was called upon to assume full political power after China's invasion of Tibet in 1950. When in 1954 he went to Beijing for peace talks with Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders, he was not yet 20. Five years later, with the brutal suppression of the Tibetan national uprising in Lhasa by Chinese troops, the Dalai Lama was forced to escape into exile. Since 1959, he has been living in northern India. That is more than 60 years of exile. I have had the opportunity to meet the Dalai Lama on a number of occasions. He is a warm, generous, compassionate man with a great sense of humor. He is also a man of peace. He has consistently advocated for policies of nonviolence even in the face of extreme aggression. In 1989, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent struggle for the liberation of Tibet. He has received over 150 awards, honorary doctorates, and prizes in recognition of his message of peace, nonviolence, interreligious understanding, universal responsibility, and compassion. His is a voice for tolerance. Unfortunately, as we all know, Tibet has not been liberated. In the late 1990s, under the Dalai Lama's leadership, the Tibetan people formally put aside the goal of independence. Since then, they have been fighting, peacefully, for their autonomy within China; but that struggle is not going very well today. Part of the reason it is not going very well is that the international community seems to be more interested in not offending China than in vigorously supporting the human rights of the Tibetan people. It seems to me that my own government has fallen into that trap. I am looking forward to the Dalai Lama's visit this week, and I know that the leadership of the House and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will welcome him with the greatest appreciation; but it is easy to praise the Dalai Lama, to meet with him, and to benefit from his teachings, yet not lift a finger to help the people of Tibet. The Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people deserve better. Madam Speaker, last November I had the honor of joining Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and my colleagues Joyce Beatty, Ted Lieu, Alan Lowenthal, Betty McCollum, and Tim Walz on a historic congressional delegation to Tibet, Beijing, and Hong Kong. I have long raised concerns about China's human rights record in Tibet. As the first congressional delegation to enter Tibet since the 2008 unrest, our trip was an important opportunity to raise the voices of the Tibetan people, and we did just that. Everywhere we went, in every meeting we had, we talked about Tibet. We talked about the Dalai Lama and his strong bipartisan support in Congress. We talked about the importance of respect for people's cultures and religions, and we talked about the need to strengthen and protect all of the human rights of the Tibetan people. During the delegation visit, we felt we had a good exchange with Chinese officials and, especially, with university students both in Tibet and in Beijing. We saw our trip--and especially the delegation's visit to Tibet--as an important gesture by the Chinese Government; but it was also clear to us that our visit was only a first step and that much more needed to be done. Since our return, we have been looking for ways to build on our visit and to advance the reforms needed for meaningful change. Here are some of the things we identified that need to happen specifically with regard to Tibet: The United States needs to open a consulate in Lhasa, Tibet; More Members of Congress, more journalists, more members of parliament from other nations, and more people in general, including members of the Tibetan community here in the United States, need to be allowed to travel freely to Tibet; Tibetans in China need to be able to travel freely as well; The dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama to resolve longstanding issues of Tibetan autonomy, religious practice, culture, language, and heritage needs to be renewed. I came away from our visit believing even more strongly that the Dalai Lama is part of the solution to resolving Tibetan grievances. Too often during our trip, we heard from some Chinese officials--not all, but some--expressions and characterizations of Tibet and the Dalai Lama that showed that some people's minds and imaginations are stuck in the past, in old prejudices. This concerned me greatly. The issue is not the past. The issue is the future of Tibet and its people. Renewing dialogue must be genuine and productive, and it cannot be just another guise for wasting time or going through the motions. We need to see a dialogue based on good faith and on the mutual need to resolve outstanding issues in a way that is acceptable to all parties. Undertaking such an initiative would be a positive reflection on the capacity of Chinese authorities to engage in constructive dialogue, and it would increase confidence the world over that the government is committed to reconciliation and ending abuses in Tibet. The Chinese Government has invested a great deal in Tibet, and that was very clear to us, but that investment must not come at the price of an entire culture. You cannot confine a people's culture and heritage-- their very sense of identity--to a museum or to a market of handicrafts. The human rights of the Tibetan people must be strengthened and protected, and I returned from the delegation visit with a renewed commitment to continue to work with my colleagues in Congress, with Leader Pelosi, to push for the reforms that are needed to achieve this, and this is the reason we are here today. Madam Speaker, I yield to our distinguished Democratic leader, who led this historic visit to Tibet, Leader Pelosi. Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for calling this Special Order this evening. Special it is, indeed, as we welcome His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, to Washington, D.C. Tomorrow, in a bipartisan way, House and Senate Democrats and Republicans will join in welcoming His Holiness. He is among one of the things we all agree on--his greatness and the honor he brings us with his visit. Madam Speaker, I completely associate myself with every word of Mr. McGovern's comments. He talked about our visit to Lhasa, to Tibet, and to other places in China. We called him Mr. McGovern's spiritual leader of our visit. As the co-chair of the Lantos Human Rights Commission of the House of Representatives, he truly believes, as His Holiness says and as I heard him say today, that we are all God's children, and that is how we have to treat each other. In listening to our colleagues of the previous Special Order, who were members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who discussed various issues of justice--social justice, health justice, and the rest--and who talked about Orlando, it focuses on how special His Holiness' visit is. In coming the day after the terrible massacre of many in the LGBT community, it is really something that should be a comfort to all of us. His Holiness' message of peace, of compassion, of respect for every person is a message of hope that is needed today, tomorrow, and the next day, which are the days His Holiness will be here, but it is needed as we go forward as well. He is a truly great man. When I awoke this morning so sad about what happened yesterday, I was full of hope about hearing what His Holiness would have to say about our responsibilities to each other. Our colleague mentioned our November CODEL. It was something that many of us had been hoping to do for many years. We had been trying for 25 years to get a visa to visit Tibet, and [[Page H3749]] the President of China gave us that opportunity. We went there to see, to learn, to observe, and to make judgments. We did not go there to burn bridges; we went there to build bridges. As Congressman McGovern said, we saw some areas in which we could work together, and we came back with some resolve, hopefully, to get other bridge building done. I have seen His Holiness on many occasions. When he first came to Congress, I was brand new in Congress. He came under the auspices of Mr. Lantos, for whom the Human Rights Commission is named, and he brought us together in a group to listen to His Holiness' plan of action. It included respect for the environment and autonomy for Tibet but not independence. That was over 25 years ago that he had been talking about autonomy. While sometimes the Chinese Government doesn't accept that characterization, it is why many of us support His Holiness. As I mentioned earlier, he has friends on both sides of the aisle on both sides of the Capitol and also down Pennsylvania Avenue. I remember with great pride when we presented His Holiness with a Congressional Gold Medal--again, with great bipartisan support. President Bush came. Not only that--and a bigger honor yet--Mrs. Laura Bush came as well. What an honor for His Holiness and what an honor for our country that our President showed that respect. On that day when we talked about it, we had so many good things to say about His Holiness. One of the things was his unstinting support for peace as a positive example of how to make the world a better place--peace in the world, peace in our country, peace in our communities, peace in our families, peace in ourselves. That inner peace is what he has been preaching. On this trip, we can see His Holiness as he embodies the wisdom and the courage to maintain what he calls a peaceful mind in a modern world, and we look forward to hearing what he has to say about that. In addition to saying we are all God's children and of the respect we need to have for each other and of the compassion that he advocates, His Holiness says that great changes start with individuals. I will tell this story, which, I think, some may find amusing. His Holiness is a gentle man. While he has big challenges and while he is the leader and the champion in the advocacy--I wouldn't use the word ``fight'' as he doesn't like words like that--for respecting the culture, the language, and the religion of the Tibetan people and the autonomy for them as a people, he does so in a very gentle way. I met him here in the Capitol for the first time, and I saw him in Rio at the time of the Earth Summit in 1992, where he spoke as a religious leader. We also acknowledged that he was the first winner of the Nobel Prize--it was part of his proclamation and why he won--for his contribution in protecting the environment. It was the first environmental consideration in a Nobel Prize. How beautiful that was. I have seen him here many times, in California, in New York--you name it--and in Dharamsala, which is where he lives in India. Anyway, we were taking a delegation there to visit--a bipartisan, large delegation to visit him there. {time} 2100 And we saw some of the people right after the crackdown in Tibet-- coincidentally, we had our trip planned for a long time, but it happened to occur right after that crackdown. So many people were coming in from Tibet telling us what they saw there. It was pretty brutal, the reports that they gave us, and it was so sad. So later in the day, when we had lunch with the couple hundred lamas from all over India, that part of India, many of them Tibetan Buddhist lamas, I explained what I had seen that morning and how transformative it was to see people get firsthand knowledge of the humanity of man and that we had to do something about it. We had our Members there. One was going to help with this, and one was going to help with that. You know, there were all these things that we were going to do to help these people. And then I said what I always said: if freedom-loving people do not speak out against oppression in Tibet because of our commercial interests with China, then we surrender all moral authority to speak on behalf of human rights anywhere in the world. Tibet remains a challenge to the conscience of the world, and we must respond to that. When I was finished, His Holiness spoke to the lamas there, and he said to the lamas: Now, let us all pray so that we could rid Nancy of her negative attitudes. Well, I thought I was making the fight, but I am not going to be holier than His Holiness. A gentle approach is what he thinks is best and respectful. I take some level of pride in telling our Chinese friends--and they are our friends. He is your friend, too, in terms of damping down any, shall we say, exuberance when we learn what we consider to be grave injustices and human rights violations. In honor of His Holiness' 80th birthday last summer--Richard Gere is the chairman of the International Campaign for Tibet and has really been a champion for His Holiness and the Tibetan people--Richard Gere and I wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed, and in it we said there is no better way to honor the Dalai Lama than by standing with him and the Tibetan people vowing to keep their cause alive. It is a beautiful culture, indeed. To hear His Holiness, as I did today, speak in Tibetan, which I didn't understand except through translation, and have him explain that the Tibetan language is a beautiful language in specifics, in terms of explaining Buddhism and matters of faith and philosophy because of its intricacies. It enhances your appreciation and understanding of Buddhism to hear it in the words of the Tibetan language, and translated from Tibetan in terms of the intricacies of the language that you would need to translate it into English or another language. So this language is important to the faith of Buddhism. It is important to the culture. It is important to the families. It is important, again, to the education of the children. And the attempts on the part of the Chinese to resettle Han Chinese, dilute the population of Tibetans in Tibet, is something that would be just really wrong, just plain and simple wrong. Again, it is a challenge to the conscience. This morning, His Holiness spoke at the United States Institute of Peace, and he said real change comes through action. He said: You all ask me for my blessing, and people say nice things, but real change comes through action. If I understood it correctly in the translation, he said that karma is not necessarily just about fate. It is about acting, action, taking action. So we all need to take action in what we believe in. Again, every opportunity I get--and I thank the distinguished gentleman, the conscience of our codel and chair of the Tom Lantos Commission on Human Rights. Every opportunity I get, and this is one of them that I treasure on the floor of the House, to say what an honor it is to even be in the same room, the same place with His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, a revered figure throughout the world. The Dalai Lama's name is synonymous with everything that is good, and that is what we emphasized to our Chinese host. We had to move, as Mr. McGovern said, beyond their outmoded thinking into another place. In terms of His Holiness, tomorrow when he comes to the Capitol, I will look forward to thanking him for his tremendous, inspiring leadership. ``Inspiration'' is such an inadequate word when it comes to what he is. We thank him for sharing the strength of his determination in pursuit of peace. He was speaking about it today in terms of something that might take some years. We may not see it, some of us--you might, Mr. McGovern; I might not--a time when the world was completely at peace. When he laughs, it is something very special. We hear the joyousness that transcends despair. In his words, we receive a message of hope and humanity when he is with us. In his presence, we feel inspired to make a difference, to make a difference in ourselves and in our world. I talked earlier about President Bush coming to the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony, and I know that the President will be receiving His Holiness this week. Presidents have done that over time, which is a source of great pride for us in our country and in [[Page H3750]] the relationship between His Holiness and our President. But it goes a long way back. I will just close by saying, when His Holiness was a very little boy and he became the Dalai Lama, he received a gift from the President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt; and he loved it because it was a watch, and the watch had the phases of the Moon. Actually, my Apple watch has the phases of the Sun. The watch had the phases of the Moon, and how prescient President Franklin Roosevelt was to send this little boy this watch, who would become so interested in science and thinking and the brain and faith and what the connection was among all of those factors. But again, the relationship between an American President and His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, goes back to when he was a little boy, and it persists into his eighties now. That is something that, again, brings luster to us in our country that we have such a beautiful relationship with such a spiritual figure in the world. So I look forward to welcoming him here tomorrow. Again, as I said to him today: You could not have come at a better time when we are so in mourning about what happened in Orlando to our LGBT loved ones, to their families, to the community in Orlando. We are grateful to the response of our first responders there and our law enforcement officials and local officials there. Again, it is the spirituality that we need to recover and draw strength to go forward to make sure that we minimize any such actions that hopefully they never happen again. How wonderful that His Holiness is here to bring us that comfort. With that, I am pleased and with great gratitude to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for being such a champion of human rights throughout the world. He and Mr. Pitts, his Republican counterpart, as co-chairs of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, do a great service to our Congress and to our country. They honor our values, the respect for the dignity and worth of every person, recognizing that we are all God's children. We all have a spark of divinity in us, and they always are speaking truth to power. I thank them for their commitment and for their courage, and to you, Mr. McGovern, for calling this Special Order today. Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished leader for being here, and I appreciate her leadership on this issue and her leadership on human rights issues. One of the things that compels us to be here today is our continued concern about the human rights situation for the Tibetan people. And whether it is the latest annual report from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom or whether it is the U.S. State Department's most recent human rights report, or almost any other report, quite frankly, by any major world respected human rights organization, we see that the conditions for the Tibetan people really are quite dire. The Human Rights Watch report, entitled, ``Relentless'' talks about the detention and prosecution of Tibetans from 2013 to 2015 under China's ``stability maintenance'' campaign. The report is based on 479 cases of Tibetans detained or tried for political expression or criticism of government policy. Human Rights Watch only included cases on which its staff was able to obtain credible information. One important source was the terrific database on political prisoners in China that was maintained by the Congressional Executive Commission on China. Without going into a lot of details, let me just highlight a couple of takeaways. Tibetans are now being detained for activities that used to be considered minor offences or not politically sensitive. Many of those detained and prosecuted come from parts of society not previously known for dissent: local community leaders, environmental activists, and villagers involved in social and cultural activities, as well as local writers and singers. I can go on and on and on. I include into the Record the Human Rights Watch report, entitled, ``Relentless,'' Madam Speaker. Relentless: Detention and Prosecution of Tibetans Under China's ``Stability Maintenance'' Campaign Summary We have followed the law in striking out and relentlessly pounding at illegal organizations and key figures, and resolutely followed the law in striking at the illegal organizations and key figures who follow the 14th Dalai Lama clique in carrying out separatist, infiltration, and sabotage activities, knocking out the hidden dangers and soil for undermining Tibet's stability, and effectively safeguarding the state's utmost interests [and] society's overall interests.--Statement by Chen Quanguo, Tibet Autonomous Region Party Secretary, December 2013 This report documents the Chinese government's detention, prosecution, and conviction of Tibetans for largely peaceful activities from 2013 to 2015. Our research shows diminishing tolerance by authorities for forms of expression and assembly protected under international law. This has been marked by an increase in state control over daily life, increasing criminalization of nonviolent forms of protest, and at times disproportionate responses to local protests. These measures, part of a policy known as weiwen or ``stability maintenance,'' have led authorities to expand the range of activities and issues targeted for repression in Tibetan areas, particularly in the countryside. The analysis presented here is based on our assessment of 479 cases for which we were able to obtain credible information. All cases are of Tibetans detained or tried from 2013 to 2015 for political expression or criticism of government policy--``political offenses.'' Our cases paint a detailed picture not available elsewhere. Stringent limitations on access to Tibet and on information flows out of Tibet mean we cannot conclude definitively that our cases are representative of the unknown overall number of political detentions of Tibetans during this period. But they are indicative of the profound impact stability maintenance'' policies have had in those areas, and of shifts in the types of protest and protester Chinese authorities are targeting there. Information on the cases comes from the Chinese government, exile organizations, and foreign media. Of the 479 detainees, 153 were reported to have been sent for trial, convicted, and sentenced to imprisonment. The average sentence they received was 5.7 years in prison. As explained in the methodology section below, the actual number of Tibetans detained and prosecuted during this period for political offenses was likely significantly higher. Many detentions documented here were for activities that the Chinese authorities previously considered to be minor offenses or not politically sensitive. Many of those detained came from segments of society not previously associated with dissent. In addition, many of the detentions took place in rural areas where political activity had not previously been reported. From 2008 to 2012, the Tibetan parts of Sichuan province had posted the highest numbers of protests and detentions on the Tibetan plateau, but in 2013 the epicenter of detentions shifted to the central and western areas of the Tibetan plateau, called the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) since 1965, which until 1950 had been under the government of the Dalai Lama. Our research found that many of those detained and prosecuted were local community leaders, environmental activists, and villagers involved in social and cultural activities, as well as local writers and singers. In the previous three decades, the authorities had rarely accused people from these sectors of Tibetan society of involvement in political unrest. Buddhist monks and nuns, who constituted over 90 percent of political detainees in Tibet in the 1980s, represent less than 40 percent of the 479 cases documented here. Almost all the protests and detentions identified in this report occurred in small towns or rural townships and villages rather than in cities, where most protests and detentions in prior years were reported to have taken place. This suggests that dissent has increased in rural Tibetan areas, where nearly 80 percent of Tibetans live. Our data also shows an overall decline in the total number of Tibetans detained for political offenses between 2013 and 2015, though this may be an artifact of the limitations on information, detailed in the methodology section below. Notably, however, the totals for these three years are significantly higher than for the 10 years before 2008 when stability maintenance policies were expanded following major protests centered in Lhasa (Ch.: Lasa), the capital of the TAR. The changing nature of unrest and politicized detention in Tibet correlates with new phases in the stability maintenance campaign in the TAR and other Tibetan areas. Since 2011, authorities have intensified social control and surveillance at the grassroots level, particularly in the rural areas of the TAR. This has included the transfer of some 21,000 officials to villages and monasteries in the TAR, where they are tasked with implementing new management, security, and propaganda operations, and, more recently, the deployment of nearly 10,000 police in Tibetan villages in Qinghai. This has led to a surge in the creation of local Communist Party organizations, government offices, police posts, security patrols, and political organizations in Tibetan villages and towns, particularly in the TAR. The implementation of these measures appears to explain many of the new patterns of detention, prosecution, and sentencing documented in this report. It was only after the [[Page H3751]] rural phase of the stability maintenance policy in the TAR was implemented from late 2011 that the number of protests and resulting detentions and convictions increased dramatically in that region. These detentions, occurring primarily in rural areas, indicate that the stability maintenance policy in the TAR has entered a third phase. The first phase entailed paramilitary operations in the immediate wake of the 2008 protests in Lhasa, when the authorities detained several thousand people suspected of involvement in those protests or associated rioting. The second phase, which began in late 2011 and is ongoing, involved the transfer of officials to run security and propaganda operations in villages, as described above. The third phase, which dates to early 2013, has involved increasing use of the surveillance and security mechanisms established during the second phase in rural villages of the TAR to single out activities deemed to be precursors of unrest. This has meant that formerly anodyne activities have become the focus of state attention and punishment, including social activities by villagers that had not previously been put under sustained scrutiny by the security forces. In the eastern Tibetan areas--comprising parts of Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, and Yunnan provinces--politicized detentions also appear to correlate with stability maintenance measures. But in these areas, the government's measures have been aimed primarily at stopping self-immolations by Tibetans protesting Chinese rule, most of which have taken place in the eastern areas. Beginning in December 2012 the authorities there conducted an intensified drive to end self-immolations among Tibetans that resulted in a sharp increase in detentions and prosecutions of Tibetans for alleged connections to self- immolations, often with tenuous legal basis. The government's introduction of grassroots stability maintenance mechanisms in the TAR and of measures against self-immolation in the eastern areas, including in many previously quiet rural areas, has resulted in certain Tibetan localities becoming sites of repeated protests and detentions, producing what could be called protest ``cluster sites,'' previously unseen in Tibetan areas. These localities saw greater numbers of politicized detentions, recurrent cycles of protest and detention, higher average sentencing rates compared to other areas, and longer sentences for relatively minor offenses. During 2013-2015, lay and religious leaders of rural communities often received unusually heavy sentences for expressions of dissent, especially if they were from a protest cluster site. Having a sensitive image or text on one's cellphone or computer could also lead to a long prison sentence, especially though not only if it had been sent to other people. Among those who received the longest sentences were people who tried to assist victims of self-immolations, leaders of protests against mining or government construction projects, and organizers of village opposition to unpopular decisions by local officials. Such activities, most of which were not explicitly political and did not directly challenge the legitimacy of the state, received markedly longer sentences than people shouting slogans or distributing leaflets in support of Tibetan independence. The incidents described in this report indicate that outbursts of unrest and waves of politicized detentions occurred in specific localities at certain times rather than being evenly dispersed across the Tibetan areas. But the range of locations and the different social levels of protesters involved suggest that political, environmental, and cultural discontent is widespread among Tibetans in many parts of the plateau. Deaths and ill-health of detainees also continued to be a serious problem in the period covered by this study. Fourteen of those detained, 2.9 percent of the total, were reported to have died in custody or shortly after release, allegedly as a result of mistreatment. The cases also involve the detention of children, including a 14 and a 15-year-old, both monks, and at least one 11-year- old child detained after his father self-immolated. The detentions, prosecutions, and convictions documented here reflect the impact of intensive new efforts by officials in Tibetan areas to prevent any repeat of the Tibet-wide protests that occurred in the spring of 2008. Yet the new policies have led to apparently unprecedented cycles of discontent in certain rural areas, and an overall increase in the types of activities that are treated as criminal challenges to the authority of the Communist Party or the Chinese state. The failure of the central government and local authorities to end these abusive policies and roll back intrusive security and surveillance measures raises the prospect of an intensified cycle of repression and resistance in a region already enduring extraordinary restrictions on basic human rights. Recommendations To the Government of China Unconditionally release from custody all persons detained without charge or convicted for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and belief, or for other conduct protected by international human rights law. Allow independent observers--including journalists, human rights monitors, and United Nations special procedures-- unimpeded access to all areas covered by the ``stability maintenance'' campaign to verify the extent of human rights violations stemming from the campaign's implementation. Ensure that all persons taken into custody have immediate access to lawyers and family members. Those taken into custody should be released unless promptly brought before a court and charged with an offense. End the collective punishment of community members for the actions, criminal or not, of local leaders or other members of their community. Conduct credible, transparent, and impartial investigations into all incidents from 2013 to 2015 that resulted in alleged extrajudicial killings, or alleged torture or other ill- treatment in custody. Make the findings of those investigations public and fairly prosecute anyone responsible for such abuses. Conduct credible, transparent, and impartial investigations into arbitrary detentions and deaths stemming from the March 2008 protests in Lhasa and across Tibetan areas. End interference by officials, party representatives, and the security forces in monasteries and other religious institutions. To the United Nations The UN secretary-general should urge China to honor the offer it made before the Human Rights Council in March 2009 to invite the UN high commissioner for human rights ``at a time mutually convenient to both sides.'' The UN high commissioner for human rights should specifically request to visit the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Tibetan Autonomous Areas in Qinghai and Sichuan provinces. The UN high commissioner for human rights, as well as the special rapporteurs and working groups on torture, enforced disappearances, and independence of judges and lawyers, should reiterate their requests to visit the region to assess the human rights situation. To Concerned Governments Urge the Chinese government to implement the following measures in Tibetan areas: provide information on all persons detained in connection with protests; end arbitrary detention and torture and other ill-treatment in detention; impartially investigate the use of excessive or lethal force by the security forces; and discipline or prosecute as appropriate members of the security forces implicated in serious abuses. Extend full and active support to the international investigation into the Tibetan protests led by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Urge the Chinese government to review the official policies and practices in Tibetan areas that have contributed to unrest. Speak out, when cooperating with China on law enforcement or counterterrorism efforts, against the use of trumped-up public order and terrorism allegations to persecute or curtail the human rights of ethnic groups. Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, this Congress has weighed in many times and in many ways on United States policy concerning Tibet. One of the most significant things we did was to approve the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, which is supposed to guide U.S. Government policy. It encourages dialogue between the Chinese Government and representatives of the Dalai Lama, and it created the post of Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues within the Department of State. Last July, in recognition of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama's 80th birthday, the House approved H. Res. 337, which cited the Tibetan Policy Act. In that resolution, Congress strongly encouraged the Government of the People's Republic of China and His Holiness to hold substantive dialogue, without preconditions, in order to address Tibetan grievances and secure a negotiated agreement for the Tibetan people. We also called for the establishment of a U.S. consulate in Lhasa. We urged the immediate and unconditional release of Tibetan political prisoners, including the 11th Panchen Lama, and Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, a Tibetan monk who tragically and unnecessarily died in Chinese custody shortly after. We called on the United States Government to underscore that any government's interference in the Tibetan reincarnation process is a violation of the internationally recognized right to religious freedom. We called upon the Government of China to allow U.S. officials and journalists and other citizens unrestricted access to Tibetan areas of China, as we allow Chinese officials and citizens access to the United States' territory. We asked that the United States and international governments, organizations, and civil society renew and reinforce initiatives to promote the preservation of the distinct religious, cultural, linguistic, and national identity of the Tibetan people. We urged the United States to use its voice and vote to encourage development organizations and agencies to design and implement development [[Page H3752]] projects that fully comply with the Tibet Project principles. These principles are meant to ensure that the needs of the Tibetan people guide all development in Tibetan areas; that their projects respect Tibetan culture, traditions, knowledge, and wisdom; and that the development initiatives neither provide incentives for nor facilitate the migration and settlement of non-Tibetans into Tibet, nor the transfer of ownership of Tibetan land or natural resources to non- Tibetans. All of these recommendations for what the United States Government should be doing are just as valid today as they were last year because very little progress has been made in the last year. I say ``very little'' because we have acknowledged the important gesture China made in allowing last fall's codel to travel to Tibet, but that is about all that has happened, and the Dalai Lama is about to be a year older. If we are not going to get moving on those longstanding recommendations, let me suggest some other things we could try. We could start a campaign to get China to allow the Dalai Lama to return to Tibet. Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state and, two, everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country. It is time to let the Dalai Lama return to his country. This House could pass a bill that I introduced, the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act, basically saying that, if the Chinese Government restricts U.S. officials and U.S. citizens access to Tibet, then we should consider limiting the access of Chinese officials when they visit the United States. We could make sure that the U.S. Government invites the Dalai Lama to every event on every occasion where his decades of knowledge, experience, and reflections would be helpful for addressing the world's problems. The Dalai Lama is a world spiritual and philosophical leader who should be contributing to global debates on countering violent extremism and on fostering peace in war-torn countries. These are just a couple of topics on which I am convinced we could all benefit from his wisdom. We could insist that Tibet be part of our climate change discussions with China. Climate change is one of the few topics on which the U.S. and China have found common ground. It is a critically important topic for Tibet, given its fragile environment and its critically important reserves of freshwater. Tibet is warming three times as fast as the rest of the world, but it is absent from the global climate change debate. {time} 2115 The Chinese leadership has acknowledged at the highest levels the scale of the environmental crisis it faces. Conserving the Tibetan Plateau is surely a shared interest, and it can only be achieved with the full participation of the Tibetan people. It is time to rally around some of these ideas or to find others. It is time to do something different on Tibet. It is time for us to think differently and to think out of the box on ways that we can advance dialogue with China, not in a confrontational way, but in ways to get China to understand the importance of recognizing the human rights of the Tibetan people and recognizing the importance of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and allowing him to return to his homeland. Madam Speaker, many of my colleagues wanted to be here today to speak on this. I include the statements of the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) in the Record. Last week the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) submitted their statements to the Record. In closing, again, I would urge all of my colleagues to join with the leader and myself in welcoming His Holiness the Dalai Lama to Washington, D.C., to the United States, wishing him good health and praying that reconciliation between the Tibetan people and the Chinese Government happens very, very soon. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I believe that the U.S. must remain committed to defending human rights and personal freedoms both within the U.S. and abroad. As our country continues to advance U.S.-China relations, we must never forget the people of Tibet. Restrictions on human rights and religious freedom in Tibet have been a growing concern to many. As a member of the Congressional Executive Committee on China, I share this concern. While Chinese investments have undoubtedly helped to modernize Tibet, these investments must not come at the expense of the rich cultural, linguistic, and religious heritage of the Tibetan people. We must continue to support the protection of traditional Tibetan culture. As you may know, I had the opportunity to be one of the first groups of Americans to travel to China and teach Chinese high school students in 1989. During that trip, I also traveled to Tibet in 1990 and, most recently, I have returned as a member of the Congressional Delegation visiting China and Tibet. The boosted economic growth, higher household incomes, and constructed railway projects have facilitated the rapid modernization of the Tibet Autonomous Region. However, we need to continue to have constructive dialogues with China to ensure the preservation of traditional Tibetan culture and Tibet's fragile ecology. The Congressional Delegation trip to Tibet provided an opportunity to have a healthy dialogue, and I want to thank our Chinese friends for engaging with us in a discussion over the most sensitive issues concerning Tibet. As a southern Minnesotan, I understand the importance of spurring economic growth while simultaneously protecting natural wonders and culture. With this in mind, I believe that Tibetans must receive the necessary rights that will allow them to protect their culture, language, religion, and environment. The U.S. was founded on the ideas of universal freedom, and I believe that we must continue to urge the Chinese government to provide less regulated religious freedom to the Tibetans. I strongly believe that a critical step to achieving religious freedom in Tibet is including the Dalai Lama in future dialogues. I have had the pleasure of meeting His Holiness on three occasions, and I share his desire to preserve Tibetan culture and resolve other issues concerning Tibet. Lastly, I encourage the Chinese government to agree to establish a U.S. Consulate in the Tibetan city of Lhasa because I believe diplomacy and talking through our concerns and partnerships under the lens of transparency can only strengthen the relationship between our two countries. I will continue to support attempts to have productive dialogues with the Chinese government concerning the future of Tibet. Improvements in the quality of life, access to clean water, and access to health care services in Tibet must also include efforts to preserve the Tibetan way of life. Mr. CAPUANO. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to His Holiness the Dalai Lama. He has come to Washington to be present when the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) awards its Democracy Service Medal posthumously to another heroic spiritual leader, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, who died in captivity in China in July of last year. The NED will also honor the Central Tibetan Administration, based in Dharamshala, India, for its commitment to freedom and democracy. It is fitting, too, as Prime Minister Nahrendra Modi concludes his visit, to recognize the generosity India has shown to exiles seeking political and religious liberty within its borders. With His Holiness and with all Tibetans, we grieve for all they have endured since the Chinese invasion, the sorrows of those who live in exile and the sufferings of those who remain. I am outraged that oppression and murder continue unabated. With His Holiness and with Tenzin Delek Rinpoche's cousin Geshe Nyima, representing his bereaved family, we mourn the shameful persecution and tragic death of a man committed to nonviolence. I urge the House to approve H. Res 584, urging President Obama to seek an independent investigation of his death and to call publicly for an end to the repressive policies of the People's Republic of China in Tibet. It has been in committee for many months. Elie Wiesel, like His Holiness awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, exhorts us: There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest. Indeed, we do protest, and further we should never cease to hold oppressors accountable. The people of Tibet, inspired by the Dalai Lama, continue to cherish their culture and traditions. I wish them all his faith and courage, today, tomorrow and every day until Tibet is free. ____________________",package_114_183.csv,52836,52836,52902,"[congressional record volume 162, number 93 (monday, june 13, 2016)] [house] [pages h3747-h3752] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 2045 tibet the speaker pro tempore (ms. mcsally). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the chair recognizes the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. mcgovern) for 30 minutes. general leave mr. mcgovern. madam speaker, i ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks and to enter additional materials into the record. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from massachusetts? there was no objection. mr. mcgovern. madam speaker, this week, washington, d.c., is blessed by the presence of his holiness, the 14th dalai lama, tenzin gyatso, who is visiting the city from june 12 through june 16 for several events and meetings. this visit provides us not only the opportunity to listen to the dalai lama speak about the modern world and confronting conflict, but also to take a look at the crisis that faces tibet and the tibetan people and ask why the united states is not doing more to protect the rights and to support the autonomy of the tibetan people. as we seek to comprehend the senseless violence of yesterday's massacre of at least 49 people in orlando, florida, and the wounding of more than 50 others--most members of the lgbt community and many of hispanic descent, all just enjoying their lives on a saturday night--i can think of no better source of words of wisdom, tolerance, and peace than of his holiness, the dalai lama. madam speaker, i include in the record an opinion piece by the dalai lama, entitled: ``the dalai lama: why i'm hopeful about the world's future.'' [from the washington post, june 13, 2016] the dalai lama: why i'm hopeful about the world's future (by the dalai lama) the 14th dalai lama, tenzin gyatso, is the spiritual leader of tibet. since 1959, he has lived in exile in dharamsala in northern india. almost six decades have passed since i left my homeland, tibet, and became a refugee. thanks to the kindness of the government and people of india, we tibetans found a second home where we could live in dignity and freedom, able to keep our language, culture and buddhist traditions alive. my generation has witnessed so much violence--some historians estimate that more than 200 million people were killed in conflicts in the 20th century. today, there is no end in sight to the horrific violence in the middle east, which in the case of syria has led to the greatest refugee crisis in a generation. appalling terrorist attacks--as we were sadly reminded this weekend--have created deep-seated fear. while it would be easy to feel a sense of hopelessness and despair, it is all the more necessary in the early years of the 21st century to be realistic and optimistic. there are many reasons for us to be hopeful. recognition of universal human rights, including the right to self- determination, has expanded beyond anything imagined a century ago. there is growing international consensus in support of gender equality and respect for women. particularly among the younger generation, there is a widespread rejection of war as a means of solving problems. across the world, many are doing valuable work to prevent terrorism, recognizing the depths of misunderstanding and the divisive idea of ``us'' and ``them'' that is so dangerous. significant reductions in the world's arsenal of nuclear weapons mean that setting a timetable for further reductions and ultimately the elimination of nuclear weapons--a sentiment president obama recently reiterated in hiroshima, japan--no longer seem a mere dream. the notion of absolute victory for one side and defeat of another is thoroughly outdated; in some situations, following conflict, suffering arises from a state that cannot be described as either war or peace. violence inevitably incurs further violence. indeed, history has shown that nonviolent resistance ushers in more durable and peaceful democracies and is more successful in removing authoritarian regimes than violent struggle. it is not enough simply to pray. there are solutions to many of the problems we face; new mechanisms for dialogue need to be created, along with systems of education to inculcate moral values. these must be grounded in the perspective that we all belong to one human family and that together we can take action to address global challenges. it is encouraging that we have seen many ordinary people across the world displaying great compassion toward the plight of refugees, from those who have rescued them from the sea, to those who have taken them in and provided friendship and support. as a refugee myself, i feel a strong empathy for their situation and when we see their anguish, we should do all we can to help them. i can also understand the fears of people in host countries, who may feel overwhelmed. the combination of circumstances draws attention to the vital importance of collective action toward restoring genuine peace to the lands these refugees are fleeing. tibetan refugees have firsthand experience of living through such circumstances and, although we have not yet been able to return to our homeland, we are grateful for the humanitarian support we have received through the decades from friends, including the people of the united states. a further source for hope is the genuine cooperation among the world's nations toward a common goal evident in the paris accord on climate change. when global warming threatens the health of this planet that is our only home, it is only by considering the larger global interest that local and national interests will be met. i have a personal connection to this issue because tibet is the world's highest plateau and is an epicenter of global climate change, warming nearly three times as fast as the rest of the world. it is the largest repository of water outside the two poles and the source of the earth's most extensive river system, critical to the world's 10 most densely populated nations. to find solutions to the environmental crisis and violent conflicts that confront us in the 21st century, we need to seek new answers. even though i am a buddhist monk, i believe that these solutions lie beyond religion in the promotion of a concept i call secular ethics. this is an approach to educating ourselves based on scientific findings, common experience and common sense--a more universal approach to the promotion of our shared human values. over more than three decades, my discussions with scientists, educators and social workers from across the globe have revealed common concerns. as a result we have developed a system that incorporates an education of the heart, but one that is based on study of the workings of the mind and emotions through scholarship and scientific research rather than religious practice. since we need moral principles--compassion, respect for others, kindness, taking responsibility--in every field of human activity, we are working to help schools and colleges create opportunities for young people to develop greater self-awareness, to learn how to manage destructive emotions and cultivate social skills. such training is being incorporated into the curriculum of many schools in north america and europe--i am involved with work at emory university on a new curriculum on secular ethics that is being introduced in several schools in india and the united states. [[page h3748]] it is our collective responsibility to ensure that the 21st century does not repeat the pain and bloodshed of the past. because human nature is basically compassionate, i believe it is possible that decades from now we will see an era of peace--but we must work together as global citizens of a shared planet. mr. mcgovern. madam speaker, by way of welcoming the dalai lama, i would like to say a few words about him and his leadership. the dalai lama, the spiritual leader of tibet, describes himself as a simple buddhist monk. he was recognized as the reincarnation of the previous 13th dalai lama when he was only 2 years old, and he was only 6 when he began his monastic studies. but years before he finished his education, when he was still a teenager, he was called upon to assume full political power after china's invasion of tibet in 1950. when in 1954 he went to beijing for peace talks with mao zedong and other chinese leaders, he was not yet 20. five years later, with the brutal suppression of the tibetan national uprising in lhasa by chinese troops, the dalai lama was forced to escape into exile. since 1959, he has been living in northern india. that is more than 60 years of exile. i have had the opportunity to meet the dalai lama on a number of occasions. he is a warm, generous, compassionate man with a great sense of humor. he is also a man of peace. he has consistently advocated for policies of nonviolence even in the face of extreme aggression. in 1989, he was awarded the nobel peace prize for his nonviolent struggle for the liberation of tibet. he has received over 150 awards, honorary doctorates, and prizes in recognition of his message of peace, nonviolence, interreligious understanding, universal responsibility, and compassion. his is a voice for tolerance. unfortunately, as we all know, tibet has not been liberated. in the late 1990s, under the dalai lama's leadership, the tibetan people formally put aside the goal of independence. since then, they have been fighting, peacefully, for their autonomy within china; but that struggle is not going very well today. part of the reason it is not going very well is that the international community seems to be more interested in not offending china than in vigorously supporting the human rights of the tibetan people. it seems to me that my own government has fallen into that trap. i am looking forward to the dalai lama's visit this week, and i know that the leadership of the house and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will welcome him with the greatest appreciation; but it is easy to praise the dalai lama, to meet with him, and to benefit from his teachings, yet not lift a finger to help the people of tibet. the dalai lama and the tibetan people deserve better. madam speaker, last november i had the honor of joining democratic leader nancy pelosi and my colleagues joyce beatty, ted lieu, alan lowenthal, betty mccollum, and tim walz on a historic congressional delegation to tibet, beijing, and hong kong. i have long raised concerns about china's human rights record in tibet. as the first congressional delegation to enter tibet since the 2008 unrest, our trip was an important opportunity to raise the voices of the tibetan people, and we did just that. everywhere we went, in every meeting we had, we talked about tibet. we talked about the dalai lama and his strong bipartisan support in congress. we talked about the importance of respect for people's cultures and religions, and we talked about the need to strengthen and protect all of the human rights of the tibetan people. during the delegation visit, we felt we had a good exchange with chinese officials and, especially, with university students both in tibet and in beijing. we saw our trip--and especially the delegation's visit to tibet--as an important gesture by the chinese government; but it was also clear to us that our visit was only a first step and that much more needed to be done. since our return, we have been looking for ways to build on our visit and to advance the reforms needed for meaningful change. here are some of the things we identified that need to happen specifically with regard to tibet: the united states needs to open a consulate in lhasa, tibet; more members of congress, more journalists, more members of parliament from other nations, and more people in general, including members of the tibetan community here in the united states, need to be allowed to travel freely to tibet; tibetans in china need to be able to travel freely as well; the dialogue between beijing and the dalai lama to resolve longstanding issues of tibetan autonomy, religious practice, culture, language, and heritage needs to be renewed. i came away from our visit believing even more strongly that the dalai lama is part of the solution to resolving tibetan grievances. too often during our trip, we heard from some chinese officials--not all, but some--expressions and characterizations of tibet and the dalai lama that showed that some people's minds and imaginations are stuck in the past, in old prejudices. this concerned me greatly. the issue is not the past. the issue is the future of tibet and its people. renewing dialogue must be genuine and productive, and it cannot be just another guise for wasting time or going through the motions. we need to see a dialogue based on good faith and on the mutual need to resolve outstanding issues in a way that is acceptable to all parties. undertaking such an initiative would be a positive reflection on the capacity of chinese authorities to engage in constructive dialogue, and it would increase confidence the world over that the government is committed to reconciliation and ending abuses in tibet. the chinese government has invested a great deal in tibet, and that was very clear to us, but that investment must not come at the price of an entire culture. you cannot confine a people's culture and heritage-- their very sense of identity--to a museum or to a market of handicrafts. the human rights of the tibetan people must be strengthened and protected, and i returned from the delegation visit with a renewed commitment to continue to work with my colleagues in congress, with leader pelosi, to push for the reforms that are needed to achieve this, and this is the reason we are here today. madam speaker, i yield to our distinguished democratic leader, who led this historic visit to tibet, leader pelosi. ms. pelosi. i thank the gentleman for yielding and for calling this special order this evening. special it is, indeed, as we welcome his holiness, the dalai lama, to washington, d.c. tomorrow, in a bipartisan way, house and senate democrats and republicans will join in welcoming his holiness. he is among one of the things we all agree on--his greatness and the honor he brings us with his visit. madam speaker, i completely associate myself with every word of mr. mcgovern's comments. he talked about our visit to lhasa, to tibet, and to other places in china. we called him mr. mcgovern's spiritual leader of our visit. as the co-chair of the lantos human rights commission of the house of representatives, he truly believes, as his holiness says and as i heard him say today, that we are all god's children, and that is how we have to treat each other. in listening to our colleagues of the previous special order, who were members of the congressional black caucus, who discussed various issues of justice--social justice, health justice, and the rest--and who talked about orlando, it focuses on how special his holiness' visit is. in coming the day after the terrible massacre of many in the lgbt community, it is really something that should be a comfort to all of us. his holiness' message of peace, of compassion, of respect for every person is a message of hope that is needed today, tomorrow, and the next day, which are the days his holiness will be here, but it is needed as we go forward as well. he is a truly great man. when i awoke this morning so sad about what happened yesterday, i was full of hope about hearing what his holiness would have to say about our responsibilities to each other. our colleague mentioned our november codel. it was something that many of us had been hoping to do for many years. we had been trying for 25 years to get a visa to visit tibet, and [[page h3749]] the president of china gave us that opportunity. we went there to see, to learn, to observe, and to make judgments. we did not go there to burn bridges; we went there to build bridges. as congressman mcgovern said, we saw some areas in which we could work together, and we came back with some resolve, hopefully, to get other bridge building done. i have seen his holiness on many occasions. when he first came to congress, i was brand new in congress. he came under the auspices of mr. lantos, for whom the human rights commission is named, and he brought us together in a group to listen to his holiness' plan of action. it included respect for the environment and autonomy for tibet but not independence. that was over 25 years ago that he had been talking about autonomy. while sometimes the chinese government doesn't accept that characterization, it is why many of us support his holiness. as i mentioned earlier, he has friends on both sides of the aisle on both sides of the capitol and also down pennsylvania avenue. i remember with great pride when we presented his holiness with a congressional gold medal--again, with great bipartisan support. president bush came. not only that--and a bigger honor yet--mrs. laura bush came as well. what an honor for his holiness and what an honor for our country that our president showed that respect. on that day when we talked about it, we had so many good things to say about his holiness. one of the things was his unstinting support for peace as a positive example of how to make the world a better place--peace in the world, peace in our country, peace in our communities, peace in our families, peace in ourselves. that inner peace is what he has been preaching. on this trip, we can see his holiness as he embodies the wisdom and the courage to maintain what he calls a peaceful mind in a modern world, and we look forward to hearing what he has to say about that. in addition to saying we are all god's children and of the respect we need to have for each other and of the compassion that he advocates, his holiness says that great changes start with individuals. i will tell this story, which, i think, some may find amusing. his holiness is a gentle man. while he has big challenges and while he is the leader and the champion in the advocacy--i wouldn't use the word ``fight'' as he doesn't like words like that--for respecting the culture, the language, and the religion of the tibetan people and the autonomy for them as a people, he does so in a very gentle way. i met him here in the capitol for the first time, and i saw him in rio at the time of the earth summit in 1992, where he spoke as a religious leader. we also acknowledged that he was the first winner of the nobel prize--it was part of his proclamation and why he won--for his contribution in protecting the environment. it was the first environmental consideration in a nobel prize. how beautiful that was. i have seen him here many times, in california, in new york--you name it--and in dharamsala, which is where he lives in india. anyway, we were taking a delegation there to visit--a bipartisan, large delegation to visit him there. {time} 2100 and we saw some of the people right after the crackdown in tibet-- coincidentally, we had our trip planned for a long time, but it happened to occur right after that crackdown. so many people were coming in from tibet telling us what they saw there. it was pretty brutal, the reports that they gave us, and it was so sad. so later in the day, when we had lunch with the couple hundred lamas from all over india, that part of india, many of them tibetan buddhist lamas, i explained what i had seen that morning and how transformative it was to see people get firsthand knowledge of the humanity of man and that we had to do something about it. we had our members there. one was going to help with this, and one was going to help with that. you know, there were all these things that we were going to do to help these people. and then i said what i always said: if freedom-loving people do not speak out against oppression in tibet because of our commercial interests with china, then we surrender all moral authority to speak on behalf of human rights anywhere in the world. tibet remains a challenge to the conscience of the world, and we must respond to that. when i was finished, his holiness spoke to the lamas there, and he said to the lamas: now, let us all pray so that we could rid nancy of her negative attitudes. well, i thought i was making the fight, but i am not going to be holier than his holiness. a gentle approach is what he thinks is best and respectful. i take some level of pride in telling our chinese friends--and they are our friends. he is your friend, too, in terms of damping down any, shall we say, exuberance when we learn what we consider to be grave injustices and human rights violations. in honor of his holiness' 80th birthday last summer--richard gere is the chairman of the international campaign for tibet and has really been a champion for his holiness and the tibetan people--richard gere and i wrote a wall street journal op-ed, and in it we said there is no better way to honor the dalai lama than by standing with him and the tibetan people vowing to keep their cause alive. it is a beautiful culture, indeed. to hear his holiness, as i did today, speak in tibetan, which i didn't understand except through translation, and have him explain that the tibetan language is a beautiful language in specifics, in terms of explaining buddhism and matters of faith and philosophy because of its intricacies. it enhances your appreciation and understanding of buddhism to hear it in the words of the tibetan language, and translated from tibetan in terms of the intricacies of the language that you would need to translate it into english or another language. so this language is important to the faith of buddhism. it is important to the culture. it is important to the families. it is important, again, to the education of the children. and the attempts on the part of the chinese to resettle han chinese, dilute the population of tibetans in tibet, is something that would be just really wrong, just plain and simple wrong. again, it is a challenge to the conscience. this morning, his holiness spoke at the united states institute of peace, and he said real change comes through action. he said: you all ask me for my blessing, and people say nice things, but real change comes through action. if i understood it correctly in the translation, he said that karma is not necessarily just about fate. it is about acting, action, taking action. so we all need to take action in what we believe in. again, every opportunity i get--and i thank the distinguished gentleman, the conscience of our codel and chair of the tom lantos commission on human rights. every opportunity i get, and this is one of them that i treasure on the floor of the house, to say what an honor it is to even be in the same room, the same place with his holiness, the dalai lama, a revered figure throughout the world. the dalai lama's name is synonymous with everything that is good, and that is what we emphasized to our chinese host. we had to move, as mr. mcgovern said, beyond their outmoded thinking into another place. in terms of his holiness, tomorrow when he comes to the capitol, i will look forward to thanking him for his tremendous, inspiring leadership. ``inspiration'' is such an inadequate word when it comes to what he is. we thank him for sharing the strength of his determination in pursuit of peace. he was speaking about it today in terms of something that might take some years. we may not see it, some of us--you might, mr. mcgovern; i might not--a time when the world was completely at peace. when he laughs, it is something very special. we hear the joyousness that transcends despair. in his words, we receive a message of hope and humanity when he is with us. in his presence, we feel inspired to make a difference, to make a difference in ourselves and in our world. i talked earlier about president bush coming to the congressional gold medal ceremony, and i know that the president will be receiving his holiness this week. presidents have done that over time, which is a source of great pride for us in our country and in [[page h3750]] the relationship between his holiness and our president. but it goes a long way back. i will just close by saying, when his holiness was a very little boy and he became the dalai lama, he received a gift from the president of the united states, franklin delano roosevelt; and he loved it because it was a watch, and the watch had the phases of the moon. actually, my apple watch has the phases of the sun. the watch had the phases of the moon, and how prescient president franklin roosevelt was to send this little boy this watch, who would become so interested in science and thinking and the brain and faith and what the connection was among all of those factors. but again, the relationship between an american president and his holiness, the dalai lama, goes back to when he was a little boy, and it persists into his eighties now. that is something that, again, brings luster to us in our country that we have such a beautiful relationship with such a spiritual figure in the world. so i look forward to welcoming him here tomorrow. again, as i said to him today: you could not have come at a better time when we are so in mourning about what happened in orlando to our lgbt loved ones, to their families, to the community in orlando. we are grateful to the response of our first responders there and our law enforcement officials and local officials there. again, it is the spirituality that we need to recover and draw strength to go forward to make sure that we minimize any such actions that hopefully they never happen again. how wonderful that his holiness is here to bring us that comfort. with that, i am pleased and with great gratitude to the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. mcgovern) for being such a champion of human rights throughout the world. he and mr. pitts, his republican counterpart, as co-chairs of the tom lantos human rights commission, do a great service to our congress and to our country. they honor our values, the respect for the dignity and worth of every person, recognizing that we are all god's children. we all have a spark of divinity in us, and they always are speaking truth to power. i thank them for their commitment and for their courage, and to you, mr. mcgovern, for calling this special order today. mr. mcgovern. madam speaker, i thank the distinguished leader for being here, and i appreciate her leadership on this issue and her leadership on human rights issues. one of the things that compels us to be here today is our continued concern about the human rights situation for the tibetan people. and whether it is the latest annual report from the u.s. commission on international religious freedom or whether it is the u.s. state department's most recent human rights report, or almost any other report, quite frankly, by any major world respected human rights organization, we see that the conditions for the tibetan people really are quite dire. the human rights watch report, entitled, ``relentless'' talks about the detention and prosecution of tibetans from 2013 to 2015 under china's ``stability maintenance'' campaign. the report is based on 479 cases of tibetans detained or tried for political expression or criticism of government policy. human rights watch only included cases on which its staff was able to obtain credible information. one important source was the terrific database on political prisoners in china that was maintained by the congressional executive commission on china. without going into a lot of details, let me just highlight a couple of takeaways. tibetans are now being detained for activities that used to be considered minor offences or not politically sensitive. many of those detained and prosecuted come from parts of society not previously known for dissent: local community leaders, environmental activists, and villagers involved in social and cultural activities, as well as local writers and singers. i can go on and on and on. i include into the record the human rights watch report, entitled, ``relentless,'' madam speaker. relentless: detention and prosecution of tibetans under china's ``stability maintenance'' campaign summary we have followed the law in striking out and relentlessly pounding at illegal organizations and key figures, and resolutely followed the law in striking at the illegal organizations and key figures who follow the 14th dalai lama clique in carrying out separatist, infiltration, and sabotage activities, knocking out the hidden dangers and soil for undermining tibet's stability, and effectively safeguarding the state's utmost interests [and] society's overall interests.--statement by chen quanguo, tibet autonomous region party secretary, december 2013 this report documents the chinese government's detention, prosecution, and conviction of tibetans for largely peaceful activities from 2013 to 2015. our research shows diminishing tolerance by authorities for forms of expression and assembly protected under international law. this has been marked by an increase in state control over daily life, increasing criminalization of nonviolent forms of protest, and at times disproportionate responses to local protests. these measures, part of a policy known as weiwen or ``stability maintenance,'' have led authorities to expand the range of activities and issues targeted for repression in tibetan areas, particularly in the countryside. the analysis presented here is based on our assessment of 479 cases for which we were able to obtain credible information. all cases are of tibetans detained or tried from 2013 to 2015 for political expression or criticism of government policy--``political offenses.'' our cases paint a detailed picture not available elsewhere. stringent limitations on access to tibet and on information flows out of tibet mean we cannot conclude definitively that our cases are representative of the unknown overall number of political detentions of tibetans during this period. but they are indicative of the profound impact stability maintenance'' policies have had in those areas, and of shifts in the types of protest and protester chinese authorities are targeting there. information on the cases comes from the chinese government, exile organizations, and foreign media. of the 479 detainees, 153 were reported to have been sent for trial, convicted, and sentenced to imprisonment. the average sentence they received was 5.7 years in prison. as explained in the methodology section below, the actual number of tibetans detained and prosecuted during this period for political offenses was likely significantly higher. many detentions documented here were for activities that the chinese authorities previously considered to be minor offenses or not politically sensitive. many of those detained came from segments of society not previously associated with dissent. in addition, many of the detentions took place in rural areas where political activity had not previously been reported. from 2008 to 2012, the tibetan parts of sichuan province had posted the highest numbers of protests and detentions on the tibetan plateau, but in 2013 the epicenter of detentions shifted to the central and western areas of the tibetan plateau, called the tibet autonomous region (tar) since 1965, which until 1950 had been under the government of the dalai lama. our research found that many of those detained and prosecuted were local community leaders, environmental activists, and villagers involved in social and cultural activities, as well as local writers and singers. in the previous three decades, the authorities had rarely accused people from these sectors of tibetan society of involvement in political unrest. buddhist monks and nuns, who constituted over 90 percent of political detainees in tibet in the 1980s, represent less than 40 percent of the 479 cases documented here. almost all the protests and detentions identified in this report occurred in small towns or rural townships and villages rather than in cities, where most protests and detentions in prior years were reported to have taken place. this suggests that dissent has increased in rural tibetan areas, where nearly 80 percent of tibetans live. our data also shows an overall decline in the total number of tibetans detained for political offenses between 2013 and 2015, though this may be an artifact of the limitations on information, detailed in the methodology section below. notably, however, the totals for these three years are significantly higher than for the 10 years before 2008 when stability maintenance policies were expanded following major protests centered in lhasa (ch.: lasa), the capital of the tar. the changing nature of unrest and politicized detention in tibet correlates with new phases in the stability maintenance campaign in the tar and other tibetan areas. since 2011, authorities have intensified social control and surveillance at the grassroots level, particularly in the rural areas of the tar. this has included the transfer of some 21,000 officials to villages and monasteries in the tar, where they are tasked with implementing new management, security, and propaganda operations, and, more recently, the deployment of nearly 10,000 police in tibetan villages in qinghai. this has led to a surge in the creation of local communist party organizations, government offices, police posts, security patrols, and political organizations in tibetan villages and towns, particularly in the tar. the implementation of these measures appears to explain many of the new patterns of detention, prosecution, and sentencing documented in this report. it was only after the [[page h3751]] rural phase of the stability maintenance policy in the tar was implemented from late 2011 that the number of protests and resulting detentions and convictions increased dramatically in that region. these detentions, occurring primarily in rural areas, indicate that the stability maintenance policy in the tar has entered a third phase. the first phase entailed paramilitary operations in the immediate wake of the 2008 protests in lhasa, when the authorities detained several thousand people suspected of involvement in those protests or associated rioting. the second phase, which began in late 2011 and is ongoing, involved the transfer of officials to run security and propaganda operations in villages, as described above. the third phase, which dates to early 2013, has involved increasing use of the surveillance and security mechanisms established during the second phase in rural villages of the tar to single out activities deemed to be precursors of unrest. this has meant that formerly anodyne activities have become the focus of state attention and punishment, including social activities by villagers that had not previously been put under sustained scrutiny by the security forces. in the eastern tibetan areas--comprising parts of qinghai, sichuan, gansu, and yunnan provinces--politicized detentions also appear to correlate with stability maintenance measures. but in these areas, the government's measures have been aimed primarily at stopping self-immolations by tibetans protesting chinese rule, most of which have taken place in the eastern areas. beginning in december 2012 the authorities there conducted an intensified drive to end self-immolations among tibetans that resulted in a sharp increase in detentions and prosecutions of tibetans for alleged connections to self- immolations, often with tenuous legal basis. the government's introduction of grassroots stability maintenance mechanisms in the tar and of measures against self-immolation in the eastern areas, including in many previously quiet rural areas, has resulted in certain tibetan localities becoming sites of repeated protests and detentions, producing what could be called protest ``cluster sites,'' previously unseen in tibetan areas. these localities saw greater numbers of politicized detentions, recurrent cycles of protest and detention, higher average sentencing rates compared to other areas, and longer sentences for relatively minor offenses. during 2013-2015, lay and religious leaders of rural communities often received unusually heavy sentences for expressions of dissent, especially if they were from a protest cluster site. having a sensitive image or text on one's cellphone or computer could also lead to a long prison sentence, especially though not only if it had been sent to other people. among those who received the longest sentences were people who tried to assist victims of self-immolations, leaders of protests against mining or government construction projects, and organizers of village opposition to unpopular decisions by local officials. such activities, most of which were not explicitly political and did not directly challenge the legitimacy of the state, received markedly longer sentences than people shouting slogans or distributing leaflets in support of tibetan independence. the incidents described in this report indicate that outbursts of unrest and waves of politicized detentions occurred in specific localities at certain times rather than being evenly dispersed across the tibetan areas. but the range of locations and the different social levels of protesters involved suggest that political, environmental, and cultural discontent is widespread among tibetans in many parts of the plateau. deaths and ill-health of detainees also continued to be a serious problem in the period covered by this study. fourteen of those detained, 2.9 percent of the total, were reported to have died in custody or shortly after release, allegedly as a result of mistreatment. the cases also involve the detention of children, including a 14 and a 15-year-old, both monks, and at least one 11-year- old child detained after his father self-immolated. the detentions, prosecutions, and convictions documented here reflect the impact of intensive new efforts by officials in tibetan areas to prevent any repeat of the tibet-wide protests that occurred in the spring of 2008. yet the new policies have led to apparently unprecedented cycles of discontent in certain rural areas, and an overall increase in the types of activities that are treated as criminal challenges to the authority of the communist party or the chinese state. the failure of the central government and local authorities to end these abusive policies and roll back intrusive security and surveillance measures raises the prospect of an intensified cycle of repression and resistance in a region already enduring extraordinary restrictions on basic human rights. recommendations to the government of china unconditionally release from custody all persons detained without charge or convicted for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and belief, or for other conduct protected by international human rights law. allow independent observers--including journalists, human rights monitors, and united nations special procedures-- unimpeded access to all areas covered by the ``stability maintenance'' campaign to verify the extent of human rights violations stemming from the campaign's implementation. ensure that all persons taken into custody have immediate access to lawyers and family members. those taken into custody should be released unless promptly brought before a court and charged with an offense. end the collective punishment of community members for the actions, criminal or not, of local leaders or other members of their community. conduct credible, transparent, and impartial investigations into all incidents from 2013 to 2015 that resulted in alleged extrajudicial killings, or alleged torture or other ill- treatment in custody. make the findings of those investigations public and fairly prosecute anyone responsible for such abuses. conduct credible, transparent, and impartial investigations into arbitrary detentions and deaths stemming from the march 2008 protests in lhasa and across tibetan areas. end interference by officials, party representatives, and the security forces in monasteries and other religious institutions. to the united nations the un secretary-general should urge china to honor the offer it made before the human rights council in march 2009 to invite the un high commissioner for human rights ``at a time mutually convenient to both sides.'' the un high commissioner for human rights should specifically request to visit the tibetan autonomous region and tibetan autonomous areas in qinghai and sichuan provinces. the un high commissioner for human rights, as well as the special rapporteurs and working groups on torture, enforced disappearances, and independence of judges and lawyers, should reiterate their requests to visit the region to assess the human rights situation. to concerned governments urge the chinese government to implement the following measures in tibetan areas: provide information on all persons detained in connection with protests; end arbitrary detention and torture and other ill-treatment in detention; impartially investigate the use of excessive or lethal force by the security forces; and discipline or prosecute as appropriate members of the security forces implicated in serious abuses. extend full and active support to the international investigation into the tibetan protests led by the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights. urge the chinese government to review the official policies and practices in tibetan areas that have contributed to unrest. speak out, when cooperating with china on law enforcement or counterterrorism efforts, against the use of trumped-up public order and terrorism allegations to persecute or curtail the human rights of ethnic groups. mr. mcgovern. madam speaker, this congress has weighed in many times and in many ways on united states policy concerning tibet. one of the most significant things we did was to approve the tibetan policy act of 2002, which is supposed to guide u.s. government policy. it encourages dialogue between the chinese government and representatives of the dalai lama, and it created the post of special coordinator for tibetan issues within the department of state. last july, in recognition of his holiness, the dalai lama's 80th birthday, the house approved h. res. 337, which cited the tibetan policy act. in that resolution, congress strongly encouraged the government of the people's republic of china and his holiness to hold substantive dialogue, without preconditions, in order to address tibetan grievances and secure a negotiated agreement for the tibetan people. we also called for the establishment of a u.s. consulate in lhasa. we urged the immediate and unconditional release of tibetan political prisoners, including the 11th panchen lama, and tenzin delek rinpoche, a tibetan monk who tragically and unnecessarily died in chinese custody shortly after. we called on the united states government to underscore that any government's interference in the tibetan reincarnation process is a violation of the internationally recognized right to religious freedom. we called upon the government of china to allow u.s. officials and journalists and other citizens unrestricted access to tibetan areas of china, as we allow chinese officials and citizens access to the united states' territory. we asked that the united states and international governments, organizations, and civil society renew and reinforce initiatives to promote the preservation of the distinct religious, cultural, linguistic, and national identity of the tibetan people. we urged the united states to use its voice and vote to encourage development organizations and agencies to design and implement development [[page h3752]] projects that fully comply with the tibet project principles. these principles are meant to ensure that the needs of the tibetan people guide all development in tibetan areas; that their projects respect tibetan culture, traditions, knowledge, and wisdom; and that the development initiatives neither provide incentives for nor facilitate the migration and settlement of non-tibetans into tibet, nor the transfer of ownership of tibetan land or natural resources to non- tibetans. all of these recommendations for what the united states government should be doing are just as valid today as they were last year because very little progress has been made in the last year. i say ``very little'' because we have acknowledged the important gesture china made in allowing last fall's codel to travel to tibet, but that is about all that has happened, and the dalai lama is about to be a year older. if we are not going to get moving on those longstanding recommendations, let me suggest some other things we could try. we could start a campaign to get china to allow the dalai lama to return to tibet. article 13 of the universal declaration of human rights says that everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state and, two, everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country. it is time to let the dalai lama return to his country. this house could pass a bill that i introduced, the reciprocal access to tibet act, basically saying that, if the chinese government restricts u.s. officials and u.s. citizens access to tibet, then we should consider limiting the access of chinese officials when they visit the united states. we could make sure that the u.s. government invites the dalai lama to every event on every occasion where his decades of knowledge, experience, and reflections would be helpful for addressing the world's problems. the dalai lama is a world spiritual and philosophical leader who should be contributing to global debates on countering violent extremism and on fostering peace in war-torn countries. these are just a couple of topics on which i am convinced we could all benefit from his wisdom. we could insist that tibet be part of our climate change discussions with china. climate change is one of the few topics on which the u.s. and china have found common ground. it is a critically important topic for tibet, given its fragile environment and its critically important reserves of freshwater. tibet is warming three times as fast as the rest of the world, but it is absent from the global climate change debate. {time} 2115 the chinese leadership has acknowledged at the highest levels the scale of the environmental crisis it faces. conserving the tibetan plateau is surely a shared interest, and it can only be achieved with the full participation of the tibetan people. it is time to rally around some of these ideas or to find others. it is time to do something different on tibet. it is time for us to think differently and to think out of the box on ways that we can advance dialogue with china, not in a confrontational way, but in ways to get china to understand the importance of recognizing the human rights of the tibetan people and recognizing the importance of his holiness the dalai lama and allowing him to return to his homeland. madam speaker, many of my colleagues wanted to be here today to speak on this. i include the statements of the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. capuano) and the gentleman from minnesota (mr. walz) in the record. last week the gentleman from new jersey (mr. smith), the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. pocan), and the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. sensenbrenner) submitted their statements to the record. in closing, again, i would urge all of my colleagues to join with the leader and myself in welcoming his holiness the dalai lama to washington, d.c., to the united states, wishing him good health and praying that reconciliation between the tibetan people and the chinese government happens very, very soon. madam speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. walz. madam speaker, i believe that the u.s. must remain committed to defending human rights and personal freedoms both within the u.s. and abroad. as our country continues to advance u.s.-china relations, we must never forget the people of tibet. restrictions on human rights and religious freedom in tibet have been a growing concern to many. as a member of the congressional executive committee on china, i share this concern. while chinese investments have undoubtedly helped to modernize tibet, these investments must not come at the expense of the rich cultural, linguistic, and religious heritage of the tibetan people. we must continue to support the protection of traditional tibetan culture. as you may know, i had the opportunity to be one of the first groups of americans to travel to china and teach chinese high school students in 1989. during that trip, i also traveled to tibet in 1990 and, most recently, i have returned as a member of the congressional delegation visiting china and tibet. the boosted economic growth, higher household incomes, and constructed railway projects have facilitated the rapid modernization of the tibet autonomous region. however, we need to continue to have constructive dialogues with china to ensure the preservation of traditional tibetan culture and tibet's fragile ecology. the congressional delegation trip to tibet provided an opportunity to have a healthy dialogue, and i want to thank our chinese friends for engaging with us in a discussion over the most sensitive issues concerning tibet. as a southern minnesotan, i understand the importance of spurring economic growth while simultaneously protecting natural wonders and culture. with this in mind, i believe that tibetans must receive the necessary rights that will allow them to protect their culture, language, religion, and environment. the u.s. was founded on the ideas of universal freedom, and i believe that we must continue to urge the chinese government to provide less regulated religious freedom to the tibetans. i strongly believe that a critical step to achieving religious freedom in tibet is including the dalai lama in future dialogues. i have had the pleasure of meeting his holiness on three occasions, and i share his desire to preserve tibetan culture and resolve other issues concerning tibet. lastly, i encourage the chinese government to agree to establish a u.s. consulate in the tibetan city of lhasa because i believe diplomacy and talking through our concerns and partnerships under the lens of transparency can only strengthen the relationship between our two countries. i will continue to support attempts to have productive dialogues with the chinese government concerning the future of tibet. improvements in the quality of life, access to clean water, and access to health care services in tibet must also include efforts to preserve the tibetan way of life. mr. capuano. madam speaker, i rise to pay tribute to his holiness the dalai lama. he has come to washington to be present when the national endowment for democracy (ned) awards its democracy service medal posthumously to another heroic spiritual leader, tenzin delek rinpoche, who died in captivity in china in july of last year. the ned will also honor the central tibetan administration, based in dharamshala, india, for its commitment to freedom and democracy. it is fitting, too, as prime minister nahrendra modi concludes his visit, to recognize the generosity india has shown to exiles seeking political and religious liberty within its borders. with his holiness and with all tibetans, we grieve for all they have endured since the chinese invasion, the sorrows of those who live in exile and the sufferings of those who remain. i am outraged that oppression and murder continue unabated. with his holiness and with tenzin delek rinpoche's cousin geshe nyima, representing his bereaved family, we mourn the shameful persecution and tragic death of a man committed to nonviolence. i urge the house to approve h. res 584, urging president obama to seek an independent investigation of his death and to call publicly for an end to the repressive policies of the people's republic of china in tibet. it has been in committee for many months. elie wiesel, like his holiness awarded the nobel peace prize, exhorts us: there may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest. indeed, we do protest, and further we should never cease to hold oppressors accountable. the people of tibet, inspired by the dalai lama, continue to cherish their culture and traditions. i wish them all his faith and courage, today, tomorrow and every day until tibet is free. ____________________",52836

Madam President, above this Capitol, the American flag flies at half-staff--a symbol of national sorrow for lives taken far too soon, a symbol of national solidarity for families left behind plunged into despair. ISIL claims that the terrorist who committed this horrific act is one of the ``soldiers of the caliphate.'' Our intelligence community will work to establish whether this terrorist was directed or inspired by ISIL. Either way, I will call him what he really is: a coward, a murderer who claimed allegiance to a brutal group that crucifies children and beheads women. This terrorist sought to spread fear and sadness and suffering. Yet, even amidst the horror, he couldn't destroy our common bonds of humanity. Every act of compassion, every outstretched arm to a friend, every calming word to a stranger--a response to his cruel ideology and a reminder of who we are as Americans. Let us recognize each act of heroism that night, and let us never forget the debts we owe to first responders--the men and women who rush toward danger and put their lives on the line for victims they never met. Local law enforcement will continue working with the FBI to determine the exact nature of this crime. We will soon find out more details. We will learn, for instance, whether this attack was ISIL directed or inspired. Whether this terrorist was in communication with ISIL in Raqqa or simply following tactics set forth in Dabiq, ISIL's online magazine, it leads to a larger point. It is no longer an open, analytical question whether the followers of ISIL and other Islamic terrorist groups will attempt to strike us here in the West--they have, and they will continue to do so. We need to do what we can to fight back so we can prevent more of these atrocities. That is exactly why, for instance, the Senate needs to be briefed on the President's counter-ISIL campaign. Understanding the President's plan with respect to ISIL is critical, especially given that the war in Iraq and Syria will outlive the life of his administration. That is why we have been asking the administration for briefings on his strategy for a very long time. I expect this will now happen very soon. We will also be receiving a briefing on the Orlando attack this Wednesday, but today is a day for sorrow and remembrance.

Madam President, on one final matter, I wish to say a few words about a colleague we lost this past weekend. George Voinovich was the oldest of six children and, until his late teens, an aspiring doctor. Then he realized he didn't get along with the scientists, so he joined the Boy Scouts. He got involved in student government, and he told his friends that one day he would become mayor and Governor. He was right. This is the guy voters chose to turn around Cleveland after a wrenching fiscal crisis. Mayor Voinovich came to office with a simple motto: ``Together We Can Do It.'' And together they did. Debts were paid down, jobs were added, and slowly the buckle of the Rust Belt became comeback city. His success propelled him to the Governor's mansion, where he served two terms, and then to the U.S. Senate, where he served another two terms. Here in the Senate, he was at the forefront of a number of important policy debates. He was an advocate for more efficient and effective government. He was an advocate for an ``all of the above'' energy approach. And this son of Eastern European immigrants cited his work to help spearhead two rounds of NATO expansion as one of his proudest achievements. ``[When NATO's Secretary General] officially announced the decision to invite Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia,'' he recalled, ``this was truly one of the most thrilling days of my tenure as a Senator.'' Senator Voinovich had a storied political career that took him from Cleveland, to Columbus, to Washington, and around the world. All along, he kept himself guided by his Catholic faith and anchored by his family. He ultimately retired to spend more time with the people who really mattered. At the top of that list was the woman who made him whole. If you don't think storybook romances can start at a Cleveland Young Republicans Club, then you didn't know George and Janet Voinovich. George and Janet were best friends, they were political confidantes, and they were deeply in love. Here in Washington, you could find them strolling to the Capitol for work or to St. Joe's for mass. When Janet came to visit the office, George would greet her with a kiss and a hug. When the Voinoviches flew back to Cleveland, which was most weekends, they would hold hands and say a prayer across the aisle to prepare for takeoff. And when it was wheels down, Janet would put Ohio's senior Senator to work on their modest home in Cleveland. They purchased that house in the 1970s in the same working-class neighborhood where George was raised.

George Voinovich was known for many things in his decades of public service. He was honest, he was plainspoken, he was loyal to those who worked for him, and, yes, he was frugal. Janet may not have appreciated it when the heat waves hit, but these are qualities that served him well in office. When asked about his legacy, Senator Voinovich said he just wanted to know he had touched people's lives and made things better.

He questioned the strategy of the war in Iraq, which he also thought was wrong. George Voinovich was right on both of those issues, and the other Republicans were wrong.

CREC-2016-06-13-pt1-PgS3814-4,CREC-2016-06-13,114,MASS SHOOTING IN ORLANDO,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3814-S3815] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MASS SHOOTING IN ORLANDO Mr. REID. Madam President, everyone is in a state of shock and sadness today, following the worst mass shooting in modern American history. The facts continue to develop--I had a long conversation with the FBI this morning--but we do know this much. A shooter pledging allegiance to ISIS opened fire at an LGBT locality in Orlando, FL, killing 49 people and leaving dozens seriously injured. This was an act of terror in every sense of the word. This was an attack on the LGBT community and all of America. My heart goes out to the victims, their families, especially those who were killed and wounded, and to the many first responders who were on the scene where one police officer was wounded. I hope every Member of the House and Senate had time for quiet reflection yesterday to ask what we could have done to prevent this tragedy. I had time to think about it. I am heartsick. I am basically sick by our inaction. It is shameful that the U.S. Senate has done nothing--nothing--to stop these mass shootings. Is this what we want for America? I don't think so. Do we want to live in a country where someone who has sworn allegiance to ISIS can walk into a store, buy assault weapons and explosives, and murder dozens of Americans in a club or at a school? I don't think we do. Is that a country where we want to live? Because that is the country where we live now, thanks to the National Rifle Association and their cowardly supporters in Congress. Last December, the senior Senator from California proposed legislation that would prevent FBI terror suspects from purchasing firearms and explosives. All but one Republican voted against the Feinstein amendment. That means that as of today, FBI terror suspects can walk into a gun store and legally purchase assault weapons and explosives. It is beyond me how these same Republicans go home knowing they voted to let FBI terror suspects continue to buy assault weapons. Senate Republicans have voted against expanding background checks, limits on the size of ammunition clips, and the assault weapons ban. How can these same Republicans campaign for reelection in good conscience, knowing [[Page S3815]] they voted to block every sensible bill to address gun violence? Not some of them, all of them. For example, how can the junior Senator from Florida--who all of a sudden has an interest in running for reelection--how can he speak of running for office again when he voted to let potential terrorists buy assault weapons and explosives? That is how he voted. The junior Senator has voted against every gun safety measure. He was quoted as saying: Well, with what happened yesterday, I might reconsider. He better reconsider his gun votes. He voted against background checks, assault weapons ban, and against legislation limiting the size of ammunition clips. I ask again: Is this what we want for America? Mass shooting after mass shooting, and each new attack, it seems, is worse than the previous one. We still have much to learn about the Orlando shooting, but we know one thing for sure. Congress is failing to do anything to prevent these mass killings--anything. Why? Because of Republican obstruction. Because of Republican obstruction, we are doing nothing. We are failing every one of the people killed on Sunday, their families, the whole State of Florida--the whole country. We are failing the families. We are failing everyone who has died in these mass shootings--and there are thousands of them--and those who have lost loved ones to mass shootings--thousands of them, I repeat; the injured, tens of thousands. As President Obama said yesterday, ``To actively do nothing is a decision as well.'' And my Republican colleagues have made that decision: doing nothing. It is time again to try to stop the plague of gun violence. We have a responsibility as lawmakers to do what we can to prevent these shootings, to enact commonsense reforms--nothing radical--that have proven to stop these attacks and save lives. We should start by closing the loophole that allows terrorists to legally purchase weapons and explosives. Remember, everyone, we voted on this. Everyone in this Chamber should be able to agree that a suspected terrorist shouldn't have guns. Is it more than common sense? I don't think so. We should do something to expand background checks, ensuring that terror suspects and criminals don't slip through the cracks, and we should do something to limit the size of weapon magazines and clips. There is no reason for gun stores to sell these clips that are that big, magazines or drums designed for the mass killing of human beings. That is what they are made for--no other purpose. People don't hunt with them. Our Nation can no longer ignore the fact that every day Americans are being gunned down in cold blood. We can no longer ignore the will of the people. We shouldn't, at least. We can no longer ignore the will of the people. The overwhelming majority of voters support these proposals. According to a December poll by one of the foremost polling agencies in America, nearly 90 percent of Americans are in favor of expanded background checks. It doesn't matter what State you go to. This was a nationwide poll. In Nevada, Massachusetts, Iowa--it doesn't matter where you go. More than 80 percent of Americans want to close so-called terror loopholes, preventing people on terror watch lists from purchasing firearms. I see my friend from Florida behind me. Of course they care, as much as anyone, if not more, today. Yet, in spite of the public's demand for action, Senate Republicans continue to cower--cower--before the NRA and the Gun Owners of America. The NRA is bad--really bad--but Gun Owners of America is even worse than bad. These two organizations are competing, seeing just how extreme they can be in pushing for more guns and fewer protections. And I know, after the statement I am making today, they will send out these fundraising calls: Reid is trying to take away our guns. Send us some money. These two organizations are competing to see how extreme they can be in pushing for more guns and fewer protections. Congressional Republicans are content just to go along. Republicans are so terrified of the extreme right that they refuse to pass legislation supported by the vast majority of their own constituents. The NRA and the Gun Owners of America mean more to them than the people they represent. Do you know what terrifies the American people? It is not the NRA. It is not the Gun Owners of America. Mass shootings scare the American people. Innocent victims being gunned down at nightclubs and holiday parties and schools and movie theaters, that is what scares the American people. Republicans need to find the backbone to stand up to groups like the NRA and Gun Owners of America. Senate Republicans are stalling important mental health legislation because they are afraid to talk about gun safety measures. Not only are they stalling, but Senate Republicans--led by the assistant Republican leader--are even threatening to include a provision that weakens the FBI's current background check system--which isn't much, to be honest with you--and to weaken it more would be speaking volumes. We don't need to hear any more of the gun lobby's talking points about how more guns are the answer to what is going on in America or hiring security guards will solve our Nation's scourge of gun violence. The Pulse nightclub in Orlando had security, and there was reportedly an armed, off-duty police officer on the scene, but even that didn't prevent this tragedy. Instead of pushing for more guns, maybe it is time to make it harder for terrorists and criminals to get guns. It is time for Congress to do something to stop the mass slaughter that is being carried out in our communities. How else can we describe it? Are 50 dead people--49 plus the killer--49 dead people--is that enough to get our attention? The 50-odd who were injured, and somebody may be paralyzed, is that enough to get our attention? It is time for Congress to do something--something--to stop this mass slaughter that is being carried out in our communities. Going forward, Democrats are going to continue to support and continue to push these solutions to our Nation's gun violence epidemic, and we are going to, as soon as we can, force a vote on this terror loophole. We are going to do this as soon as possible. There is no excuse for allowing suspected terrorists to buy guns. There is much we can do but not if Republicans aren't serious about addressing these problems, and historically it has been proven they do not care. I hope Republicans will find the courage, like George Voinovich, to help us pass meaningful legislation to protect the American people. By the way, George Voinovich was a good Republican. Madam President, will the Chair announce the business for the rest of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3814-S3815] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MASS SHOOTING IN ORLANDO Mr. REID. Madam President, everyone is in a state of shock and sadness today, following the worst mass shooting in modern American history. The facts continue to develop--I had a long conversation with the FBI this morning--but we do know this much. A shooter pledging allegiance to ISIS opened fire at an LGBT locality in Orlando, FL, killing 49 people and leaving dozens seriously injured. This was an act of terror in every sense of the word. This was an attack on the LGBT community and all of America. My heart goes out to the victims, their families, especially those who were killed and wounded, and to the many first responders who were on the scene where one police officer was wounded. I hope every Member of the House and Senate had time for quiet reflection yesterday to ask what we could have done to prevent this tragedy. I had time to think about it. I am heartsick. I am basically sick by our inaction. It is shameful that the U.S. Senate has done nothing--nothing--to stop these mass shootings. Is this what we want for America? I don't think so. Do we want to live in a country where someone who has sworn allegiance to ISIS can walk into a store, buy assault weapons and explosives, and murder dozens of Americans in a club or at a school? I don't think we do. Is that a country where we want to live? Because that is the country where we live now, thanks to the National Rifle Association and their cowardly supporters in Congress. Last December, the senior Senator from California proposed legislation that would prevent FBI terror suspects from purchasing firearms and explosives. All but one Republican voted against the Feinstein amendment. That means that as of today, FBI terror suspects can walk into a gun store and legally purchase assault weapons and explosives. It is beyond me how these same Republicans go home knowing they voted to let FBI terror suspects continue to buy assault weapons. Senate Republicans have voted against expanding background checks, limits on the size of ammunition clips, and the assault weapons ban. How can these same Republicans campaign for reelection in good conscience, knowing [[Page S3815]] they voted to block every sensible bill to address gun violence? Not some of them, all of them. For example, how can the junior Senator from Florida--who all of a sudden has an interest in running for reelection--how can he speak of running for office again when he voted to let potential terrorists buy assault weapons and explosives? That is how he voted. The junior Senator has voted against every gun safety measure. He was quoted as saying: Well, with what happened yesterday, I might reconsider. He better reconsider his gun votes. He voted against background checks, assault weapons ban, and against legislation limiting the size of ammunition clips. I ask again: Is this what we want for America? Mass shooting after mass shooting, and each new attack, it seems, is worse than the previous one. We still have much to learn about the Orlando shooting, but we know one thing for sure. Congress is failing to do anything to prevent these mass killings--anything. Why? Because of Republican obstruction. Because of Republican obstruction, we are doing nothing. We are failing every one of the people killed on Sunday, their families, the whole State of Florida--the whole country. We are failing the families. We are failing everyone who has died in these mass shootings--and there are thousands of them--and those who have lost loved ones to mass shootings--thousands of them, I repeat; the injured, tens of thousands. As President Obama said yesterday, ``To actively do nothing is a decision as well.'' And my Republican colleagues have made that decision: doing nothing. It is time again to try to stop the plague of gun violence. We have a responsibility as lawmakers to do what we can to prevent these shootings, to enact commonsense reforms--nothing radical--that have proven to stop these attacks and save lives. We should start by closing the loophole that allows terrorists to legally purchase weapons and explosives. Remember, everyone, we voted on this. Everyone in this Chamber should be able to agree that a suspected terrorist shouldn't have guns. Is it more than common sense? I don't think so. We should do something to expand background checks, ensuring that terror suspects and criminals don't slip through the cracks, and we should do something to limit the size of weapon magazines and clips.

The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 2943) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. Pending: McCain amendment No. 4607, to amend the provision on share- in-savings contracts. Reed (for Reid) amendment No. 4603 (to amendment No.4607), to change the enactment date. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida. Mass Shooting in Orlando Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I have just returned from the command center of the emergency operations center, a temporary one that has been set up in the middle of South Orange Avenue, very close to the Pulse nightclub, not far from the hospital where so many of the victims have been taken, where 9 of the victims died in the care of the doctors, and where there are up to 50 people, some of whom are still fighting for their lives. Needless to say, Orlando is shocked. We didn't know a place that sometimes [[Page S3816]] is called the happiest place on Earth could be one of the saddest places on Earth. Indeed, the morning's Orlando Sentinel, the entire front page is dedicated to a statement by the paper entitled ``Our Community Will Heal.'' Will our community heal? Well, certainly, in what we see with the long lines snaking around the block at the blood donation center, where it is literally going around what would be the length of 2 blocks, and where there are people standing in the hot Sun with umbrellas to donate blood, that says something about how the community will heal. Indeed, when we had our office in Orlando opened on Sunday, the kinds of calls expressing grief and shock and just disbelief, along with the messages of comfort, has been quite a contrast to the 95 percent of the hundreds and hundreds of calls the Orlando office has received today. Ninety-five percent of those calls have been hateful. What does that say about us as a nation? Will we, in fact, heal? What does it say about us as a nation deep inside? Have we lost the teachings in almost all the major religions--clearly in the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament and clearly in the New Testament, as well as in the Koran. You will recognize these words if I say it in the old English: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Putting it in modern English, it means to treat others as you would want to be treated. Yet what we find is that in our society today there are folks who want to divide instead of unify, and this killer is a good example. I have spent two days with the FBI. I have been on the phone. I have talked to the Secretary of Homeland Security. I have talked to our intelligence community. It is this Senator's opinion that once the dots are completely connected--and they are being rapidly connected. The FBI is doing a great job. They are the lead in Orlando. By the way, talking about something good, what about the cooperation and coordination, which has been almost seamless, among local, State, and Federal Government officials, all represented down there in the command center, all being represented as a number of us went in front of the assembled cameras? It seems that is a good thing. That is unity. That is how we do things in America. Yet, as the dots are being connected, we will find out that, yes, this shooter was ISIS-inspired--and that is a whole set of issues--and how are we going to protect ourselves in the future? But we are also going to find that this shooter was inspired by hatred, and we are going to find that this hatred was directed, as his father already said in interviews, toward the gay community. So here again, we have another terrible tragedy. I have had a number of calls from my fellow Senators. One of those calls came from Richard Blumenthal. He is from Connecticut. He has reason to be sensitive about this because of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, where 20 children and some 6 adults were gunned down needlessly. Maybe that was a mental case. Maybe part of this one in Orlando is a mental case. But it is driven by hatred, maybe through ISIS, a hatred of America and of a free society being willing to be able to speak what you want without fear of persecution, or maybe it is a hatred about a group of people. It is exactly the opposite of what is taught in all of the Scriptures. So as we heal in Orlando, it will take a while. You can imagine those families of the ones who have been lost. You can imagine the families down in the Orlando Health hospital right now, grieving, hoping, and praying that those victims fighting for their lives are going to make it. So America, we are going to have to dig down deep and find out who we really are. You know, I really know who we are. We are a people with a character that is compassionate, generous, kind, and respectful. We as Americans are ladies and gentlemen. We can express ourselves as has been the tradition on the floor of this Senate in the heat of political debate. We can sharply differ, but we can be respectful of the other fellow's point of view. That is America, and until we finally come to the conclusion and insist that this aberrant behavior be stopped--until that happens--we will still be grieving. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Madam President. I rise to echo the sentiments of the Senator from Florida. His State has suffered an unspeakable tragedy. It is something that unfortunately brings together two terrible biases--one against the LGBT community and the other a religiously based radical attack inspired by ISIS at that nightclub. They all came together. To the Senator and to everyone from Florida, our deepest, deepest sympathies go to you. It was, of course, something that was understood in Massachusetts. He mentioned the Tsarnaev brothers as an inspiration to him. They struck on Patriots Day in 2013 in the United States. Mohamed Atta and the other nine hijackers were in Boston when they hijacked the two planes from Logan International Airport. So we know those people are out there. We know that their hate-filled message is intended to kill innocent Americans, and we saw it once again. Unfortunately, the target was a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. But for us, I think we have to learn from this. This man had been investigated as a terrorist suspect, and yet we are blocked--the Senator from Florida and I and others--from passing a law that would prevent anyone on a terror watch list from buying a gun in these United States. It is not against the law. The National Rifle Association has enough power here on the floor of the Senate to prohibit someone who is on a terror watch list from buying guns in the United States of America. We need another vote on that issue here in the Senate. We need to give the protections to the American people for them to know that someone on a terror watch list cannot buy a gun in the United States of America. We also have to ban these military-style assault weapons, like the AR-15, which are the guns of choice for those who seek to inflict mass casualties on civilians. These are not weapons that belong on the streets of our country. They belong in combat overseas, not in our communities. They don't belong in Newtown, they don't belong in San Bernardino, and they don't belong in Orlando. They don't belong in our streets or in our schools or in a civilized society, yet we cannot ban these weapons from being sold in the United States of America. We have to prevent any known or suspected terrorist from buying firearms, and we have to make it impossible, as well, for them to buy these assault weapons. This is our challenge now. Once again, we are warned. Once again, we are told what the weapon of choice is. Once again, we know that they are going to target us if we make it easy for them to access these weapons. How many warnings do we need? The NRA really should stand for ``not relevant anymore'' in American politics. They should not control the agenda here on the floor of the Senate. We should be able to ban people on the terror watch list from buying guns. We should be able to ban these assault weapons from being sold at all inside of our country. The Senate leadership should stop banning a vote here on the Senate floor on ensuring that we do the research at the CDC on this relationship between mental health and the use of guns within our society. The bill that I have introduced calls for $10 million a year for the next 6 years. We can't even get the money to research gun violence in the United States of America. It doesn't have to be this way. We can change. We can learn these lessons, but we can't wait any longer to put those commonsense gun laws on the books. We cannot wait any longer to make our streets safer. So let's close the gun show loophole that allows anyone to go into one of these Kmarts full of killing machines and buy a gun without a background check. Let's close the loophole that allows domestic abusers to buy guns. Let's close the loophole that allows straw purchasers to buy guns and flood our streets with them. Let's repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and take away the gun manufacturers' immunity from civil liability. PLCAA should stand for ``protecting lives, creating arms accountability,'' not protecting these arms manufacturers from liability if these guns are used to kill innocent people in our society. [[Page S3817]] So in the coming days and weeks, you can be assured that the National Rifle Association will be opposed to even these limited commonsense gun measures. The NRA has had a stranglehold over Congress for far too long. It is time to end its reign of power. It is time to end its viselike grip on the safety and security of our Nation. Those in Congress who do not support these commonsense measures are siding with those forces that make it easier for these massacres to happen. That is the bottom line of where we are. Now is the time to stand up for the families of Columbine, of Newtown, of Aurora, of Chattanooga, of Charleston, of San Bernardino, and now of Orlando, and of all of the cities across our country, which are saying: Enough is enough. I was so proud on Saturday to march in the Boston Gay Pride Parade. It was a joyous occasion where love, community, and social justice were all celebrated with a passion and a real sense of progress. But as I woke up the next morning, I saw again how an individual armed with guns and fueled by extremist ideology can fuel violence and terror. We are a nation of hope, not hatred. After this tragedy, after this deplorable attack, let's denounce hate in all of its forms. Let's stand with the LGBT community and raise our voices with dignity, equality, and love. Let's say no to the rhetoric of hate that demonizes our friends and neighbors because of their faith, sexual orientation, or because of their country of origin. Let's recommit to justice and moving progress forward. The American people are begging, pleading for this institution to enact commonsense gun safety measures. My hope is that the Senate can succeed where it has recently failed and muster the political will and courage to deliver badly needed reform of our gun laws. Let's work together to do this and to help prevent yet another mass shooting in our country. I yield back. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Madam President, it is good to see the Presiding Officer this afternoon. This past weekend, Saturday, my wife and I went to New York City at the invitation of one of our sons. We visited the 9/11 Memorial in New York, literally erected on the site of the World Trade Center. I must confess it was emotionally charging, very saddening, and at the same time uplifting and inspiring. I never imagined that within the space of less than 24 hours we would see dozens of our young have their lives taken from them. I remember walking through the 9/11 Memorial--and for those who have not been, I urge you to go. For those who have, you probably remember going through parts of the memorial and literally seeing the faces of 3,000 men, women, and some children whose lives were snuffed out that day some 15 years ago. Every one of them had moms and dads. They had grandparents. A number of them had children, spouses, brothers, sisters, cousins, nephews, and nieces. Those families struggle even today with their loss. The young people who died Saturday night, Sunday morning in a nightclub in Orlando, like those many folks whose faces we saw on Saturday, also have moms and dads, grandmoms, granddads, brothers, sisters, and cousins. Their families are mourning today just like others did 15 years ago. What I want to do is preface my remarks by reaching out across the miles to the families who are mourning, trying to deal with their losses, and let them know that we want to take you in our loving embrace. To the best of our ability, we also want to make sure we continue to take steps in this country to ensure we reduce the likelihood that these kinds of attacks are going to occur and that when they do, if they do, we are better prepared to deal with them. The killer, the man who took the lives of 49 people, demonstrated an act of hatred--in part, an act of terrorism but really an act of hatred. The question is, What do we do about it? Some would have us close our borders, the ability to come here even on a short-term basis: If you happen to be Muslim, we are going to keep you out. That is exactly what ISIS would like for us to do. There are 3.3 million Muslims in this country. The idea of somehow turning them against the rest of us, that is the kind of thing happening in some parts of Europe. Unlike Europe, we are a country where we accept the people who come to our shores. We accept them. When you were a stranger in my land, did you take me in? For us, for years, for decades, and for a couple of centuries, the answer has been yes. That doesn't mean we shouldn't very carefully check and test the backgrounds of the people who come here to make sure they are who they say they are, that they are not on a terrorist watch list. We have a bunch of those. We want to make sure our agencies and our terrorist watch lists are coordinated. We want to make sure our intelligence agencies are in close communication with one another. Part of the goal of ISIS is to make this a clash between the United States and the Muslim population here, 3.3 million people, and around the world. That is not what we should do. We should be smarter than that. One of the things we need to do is to continue the work that was begun from last year--I have said it often, I am going to say it again--to degrade and destroy those who would do us harm. Those who would do us enormous harm are trying to set up a caliphate. They are somehow using their religion, bastardizing their religion, and making it say things it doesn't even begin to say. What we need to do is make sure they get no further. The progress that has been made in terms of rolling them back was with the help of a coalition that includes 15 nations--16 nations. We are taking back a lot of the land and about to--I hope--take Fallujah and Mosul and continue there. When ISIS wannabes pop up in other countries, the idea is to work with our coalition in the countries that ISIS is trying to get a foothold in and make sure they are not successful. So it is a little like Whac-a-Mole--but it is not a game--and it is one we want to make sure they don't get a chance to get started there. If you look at the amount of money--ISIS used to make a lot of money selling oil. They take over oil refineries and oilfields, and they sell the oil on the black market. We have greatly diminished their ability to do that and greatly diminished their ability to make money. In some cases, we have figured out where they are keeping their cash stored, and we have gone in and destroyed literally hundreds of millions of dollars in their currency that they were harboring. There are a number of people coming from around the world to go to that part of the world--Iraq, Syria--who want to be ISIS volunteers. It is greatly diminished from what it was. It is down from 2,000 a month this time maybe last year to something that is just a fraction of that. In the United States not that long ago, early this year, maybe six people a month were going from the United States to the Middle East to be part of ISIS, and they are down to maybe one per month. It is still one too many, but we are headed in the right direction. The people who are being radicalized here by ISIS, ISIS is not sending people here to radicalize them. ISIS is basically trying to do this through social media, to use the Internet, and they are pretty good at it, but one of the things that will make them not so effective is once we demonstrate--and I think we are on our way to doing that-- that ISIS is a losing team. The people who are apparently claiming credit for it--or the killer in this case who killed all of our folks over the weekend, he was looking for a winning team. He is not a person who had a lot of wins in his life, and he wanted to be a part of a winning team. Our challenge is to make sure that anybody who is looking for a winning team or thinks they can, through radicalization, attacks, and terrorism--we need to make sure they know they are barking up the wrong tree. ISIS is a losing team. One of the ways we can do that is--the Presiding Officer along with me and a number of others on the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs have been all over this issue for years. It led to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. We continue to stay right on this issue, and we will probably be doing that for as long as any of us are in the Senate. [[Page S3818]] Part of what we should be doing, aside from degrading and destroying ISIS--if we are smart, one of the things we need to do is reach out to the Muslim community in this country, unlike what has happened in places in Europe, where you have a lot of Muslim folks who are all segregated. They are not part of the culture. They are not welcomed so much in those countries. One of the things about us in America is we are a melting pot. We have been a melting pot forever. When I was a stranger in your land, did you take me in? For years, we said the answer is yes. The Department of Homeland Security has asked for authorization to be able to create our community partnership, to reach out to Muslim communities across America, to meet with parents, with young people, not so young people, face the community, and make it clear they are a part of this country, make sure they say to their own people, their own young people: Don't do this. Don't do what this guy did over the weekend in Orlando. That is not part of our religion. It is not part of their religion. Don't go there. The third thing we can do and ought to be doing is to strengthen our defenses at home. We had an active shooter situation for hours into the wee hours of Saturday evening to Sunday morning, an active shooter situation. It is not the first active shooter situation we have faced. They are not easy to deal with. One of the things the Department of Homeland Security can do, is doing, and ought to be doing more of, if given the resources, is doing active shooter training in police agencies all over the United States. If they ever face a situation such as this, they know what to do and they are able to be effective and save lives. The other thing I would mention in terms of resources, as the Presiding Officer knows, we put a fair amount of resources toward a fusion center. Sometimes people used to call them confusion centers, but actually they are a fusion center. They give the ability to State and local law enforcement agencies to work with the Feds to better ensure that information gathered locally works its way up the channel, up through the chain of command, to be shared nationally with other States and with the Federal Government, and to make sure the converse is true, to the extent that we gather useful information at the national level, international level, that we bring it down and we funnel it back into individual States through fusion centers so they act on that actionable intelligence. We need to work with energy in this regard. We need to work with a sense of urgency. We need to make sure, as we go through the appropriations process in the Senate in the days and weeks ahead, that we are putting resources, financial resources, where they need to go. A number of folks have asked me in interviews yesterday and today: What should we be doing about gun control? How does all of this relate to gun control? The answer is, I am not sure how this is going to affect the way we view guns. I believe in the Second Amendment right. I am sure the Presiding Officer does, a former Army colonel, retired colonel. I am a retired Navy captain, a Vietnam veteran. My dad was a chief petty officer in World War II and served for a long time as a chief petty officer in the Reserves after that. My dad was a hunter. He came from a family of hunters and taught me to be a hunter and a fisherman. One of the proudest possessions I own is a shotgun my grandfather gave me before he died. When I was in the Navy, I used to go back on leave from Southeast Asia, go visit my parents near Clearwater, FL, and stay in a guest bedroom. In the guest bedroom, under my bed where I slept, were guns. I opened the closet in the guestroom for my clothes, and there were guns. My father, in addition to being a hunter, actually bought and sold guns. He would basically sell them to people he knew. He felt they were not people who were mentally unstable or people who were felons, but he believed in the Second Amendment right. My dad also believed in common sense. My dad is now deceased, but if he were alive and he heard that people who are on terrorism watch lists can literally buy weapons, including assault weapons, automatic weapons, he would say: That doesn't make any sense. If he found out we could go to a gun show, and a person who is mentally unstable, has a history of mental illness, and maybe someone who is a convicted felon could actually walk into a gun show and go to a federally registered gun dealer, be denied the ability to purchase an assault weapon, and then go to the next table over with someone who is not a federally registered gun dealer and purchase the same weapon they had just been denied, in terms of what makes sense and doesn't make sense to my dad and frankly to me--his son--those situations don't make a whole lot of sense. Those are areas we ought to agree on. One of our colleagues, as the Presiding Officer knows, Senator Enzi from Wyoming, likes to talk about the 80-20 rule. It is a great rule. It says there is about 80 percent of the stuff we agree on and maybe 20 percent of an issue we don't agree on. What we should do is focus on the 80 percent we agree on. My hope is--most Americans get it, in terms of making sure that folks who are on the terrorist watch list don't have access to buy weapons. They get it. I think they also get the idea that this gun show loophole is something that ought to be closed as well. I close by saying, in a sense, this is a test of our character as a nation. I said earlier our tradition has always been that we welcome people from disparate places, in some cases people fleeing oppression, lack of freedom, lack of religious opportunities and freedom of worship. That is the way we operate as a country. You don't open and read the Constitution--it doesn't say Matthew 25 because we decided we are not going to establish a religion here. If we did, Matthew 25 says: When I was hungry, did you feed me? When I was thirsty, did you give me to drink? When I was naked, did you clothe me? When I was a stranger in your land, did you take me in? I think we have a moral obligation to the least of these, including those who are fleeing oppression in other places looking for an opportunity for a new life. I think we have a moral obligation to welcome them, but we have a moral obligation to those who live here, to make sure that as we welcome people from other places, we do not imperil them by those who arrive from other shores. The last thing I would say is, we need the kind of leadership in this body that seeks to really do what it says right over the Presiding Officer's head, where the Presiding Officer is sitting. The Latin words--I don't know a lot of Latin words but ``e pluribus unum''--from many, one. Those are words that we would be wise to remember from this day as we go forward. I think that is pretty much what I wanted to say. As this week goes on, I ask that my colleagues and I find out as much as we can, learn as much as we can, find out what went right and what went wrong, and do more of what went right. And at the end of the day, let's make sure we are true to the values on which this country was built. I thank the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank our colleague for his words. I certainly join him in mourning the horrible, tragic loss of life this weekend in Orlando. Certainly I am committed, along with all our colleagues, to fighting terror wherever it exists and whomever it targets. This was absolutely horrible. Mr. President, I also rise today in support of a really important piece of bipartisan legislation that I have been working on with Senator Shaheen. I have introduced it to reauthorize the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Programs-- two vital small business programs in the Federal Government. We have an opportunity to accomplish this--to fully reauthorize and improve these programs--in the context of this Defense authorization bill that is on the floor now. I am very hopeful we are going to do that as part of a managers' package to the bill. These two programs--the Small Business Innovation Research and the Small Business Technology Transfer Programs--are really vital and useful to the success of small businesses directly responsible for creating thousands, tens of thousands of new jobs. By funding small businesses and entrepreneurs in the critical early stages [[Page S3819]] of R&D, these programs allow firms to drive the innovation sector of the economy with new ideas and technologies. Very rarely have government programs had such a clear and measurable, positive and stimulating effect on the economy. SBIR and STTR are also crucial to Federal agencies as they solve many of our biggest science and technology challenges. Giving small, innovative firms access to already appropriated Federal R&D funding is a win-win--a win for the small business sector and just as importantly a win for the taxpayer and those agencies. These programs exist to foster innovation, to facilitate public- private partnerships, to give firms the funding they need to help 11 Federal departments and agencies meet their R&D needs. These programs not only create jobs, but they also lead to a path for commercialization for many of these businesses, which is absolutely key to their success. These programs have been front and center in improving our Nation's capacity to innovate. Over the course of the SBIR Program history from 1982 to 2014--the last year for which we have numbers--Federal agencies have made more than 152,000 SBIR awards to small businesses to develop innovative technologies, and the total dollar amount awarded--again out of existing R&D budgets--is $42 billion. In 2014 alone, SBIR gave nearly 5,500 Phase I and Phase II awards worth about $2.2 billion, and the SBA is currently reporting an average of 5,000 awards per year. These awards are directly responsible for some of the most popular technologies that are available to the public today. For instance, through an SBIR award from the Air Force, we have created a technology known as LASIK, originally to correct vision for pilots, but that is a widely used technology to correct vision for all Americans. That was an SBIR success. Military armor has been a regular success of the SBIR Programs. ArmorWorks is a great example. That created over 350,000 top-of-the- line body armor plates worn by U.S. service men and women in the United States. Liftware Spoon--a spoon that stabilizes hand tremors for patients with Parkinson's disease and essential tremor--again is a clear, identifiable, and important SBIR success story. HydroMARK decreases patient discomfort with a minimally invasive breast biopsy procedure. With the HydroMARK, a mammogram is no longer necessary and the surgeon or radiologist can use an ultrasound to locate the tumor. This is a huge innovation that has dramatically improved thousands of women's lives and, again, directly out of SBIR. Bioseal reduces lung collapse rates after lung biopsies. iRobot's Roomba is something I can relate to. It is moving around at home when I am there on the weekend. This is the popular autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner that has reached major commercial success, selling over 10 million units. That is directly out of SBIR. These programs we are talking about, which have been so successful, are set to expire September 30 of 2017. As many of my colleagues can attest, it was a tumultuous process to complete the last reauthorization, so we are starting early now so we don't go through that tumultuous process again. Back then--the last reauthorization-- participating agencies and firms had to endure a process that took over 3 years and 14 short-term extensions. In a bipartisan effort with Senator Shaheen, we have been working for the last year to avoid all that and to do this ahead of time so we don't have all of that tumult and uncertainty, which saps the effectiveness of the program for a significant period of time. Reauthorizing these programs this year will ensure stability, foster an environment of innovative entrepreneurship, and avoid that uncertainty by directing more than $200 billion annually to this R&D funding to the Nation's small business firms. As chair of the Senate's Small Business Committee, I have made this a real priority. Senator Shaheen, as ranking member, has done the same. So I thank all of our committee members who are solidly behind this effort. I also thank so many other Members of the Senate who have been cooperative. In the context of this Defense bill, we have cleared our reauthorization amendment with the Senate Committee on Armed Services, and I want to specifically thank Senators McCain and Reed for their leadership. We have cleared it with the Commerce Committee because agencies under the jurisdiction of that committee are involved. We have cleared it with the HELP Committee. They have the same tangential relationship. We are the authorizing committee, but some agencies involved are under their jurisdiction. We have cleared it with everyone in sight, so that means we have a real opportunity to have this in the managers' package--which it is, as I speak--and to pass it through the Defense bill as a full reauthorization. I am also proud to share that not only will our reauthorization annually direct more than $2 billion of Federal R&D to small firms that are most likely to create jobs and commercialize their projects, but it will also establish the Regional SBIR State Collaborative Initiative Pilot Program to help low-participation States attract R&D funding for their businesses. All of this reauthorization is a true consensus effort, so I am grateful to the more than 50 organizations that strongly support it-- among them the Small Business Technology Council, the National Small Business Association and the Defense Alliance, and 47 more. It is a true consensus effort. They all support the effort, as does the leadership of SAS; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; and the Commerce Committee. So it is an important opportunity that we shouldn't let fall through our grasp. Again, I want to stress that reauthorizing this program is an effective way to meet national needs while jump-starting entrepreneurs, growing our economy, and creating jobs. With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this consensus amendment and help ensure that small businesses across the country can operate with long-term certainty and stability, which this amendment will provide. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mass Shooting in Orlando Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, the atrocity that occurred this past weekend in Orlando, FL, was an attack on every American, and my deepest condolences are with the victims and the families of this appalling attack. I am grateful for our law enforcement and the first responders who bravely put their lives on the line to save others. This attack--the deadliest in American history since 9/11--was carried out by a gunman who pledged allegiance to ISIS. There are 49 families who received phone calls this weekend--phone calls we all hope we never receive. There are 49 families who are arranging for funerals this week. They never dreamed they would be put in this position--the tragedy, the sorrow of the mothers, the fathers, the aunts, the uncles, the brothers, the sisters, the grandparents, the cousins, and friends who will all be attending funerals this week. Additionally, there are more than 50 families dealing with family members who were injured, some gravely, who are fighting for their lives as I speak. Montana is a long ways away from Orlando, but I can tell you that last night across our State there were vigils in Great Falls, Helena, Missoula, Bozeman, Butte, and Billings, MT. We stand united with Orlando. This threat of ISIS is continuing to grow each and every day. We need a strong strategy to destroy the growing threat of Islamic extremism-- Islamic extremism on our soil as well. President Obama, what is that strategy? We need to aggressively go after radical jihadists who seek to destroy our way of life and disturb the peace in our communities. The senseless hate of ISIS and radical Islam will not defeat us but, rather, strengthen our resolve and commitment to freedom. We need to remember that this was an act of terror on American soil, that this is a threat we face from radical Islam and ISIS, and that the worst response would be to politicize this and use this tragedy to restrict our constitutional rights and freedoms. We cannot allow dangerous terrorists to hide in our communities. We need to seek them out and ensure they aren't [[Page S3820]] able to inflict harm on our neighbors, our friends, and our families. May God comfort those who have been profoundly affected by this tragedy, and may God protect our men and women who are defending our country both here and abroad every day. We are a strong nation, and together we will protect our country and ensure victory over the terrorists who want to take away our very way of life here in America. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the junior Senator from Montana. I appreciate his coming to the floor today. I rise today with a heavy heart. Since I first heard the horrible news about the senseless act of terrorism in Orlando, the victims, the partners, and the families have been at the center of my thoughts and prayers. But thoughts and prayers are not enough. It is long past time for the Senate to come together and have a conversation about what steps need to be taken to put an end to this violence and hatred. We cannot continue to be crippled by inaction. The Senate needs to come together to strengthen our national security. After attacks like Orlando, we hear folks say ``Never again,'' but actions really do speak louder than words. It is time that we work together to try to prevent these senseless acts of terror and violence. That conversation begins with our national security and what needs to be done to keep our families and our communities safe. There are actions we can take right now to bolster our national security. There is no question that we must pass legislation that keeps guns out of the hands of terrorists. We absolutely do need to secure our borders. And we need to continue to crack down on insider threats by reforming our security clearance process. Intolerance and hate have no place in this country, and as elected leaders, we have a responsibility to ensure that every American can live their life each day free from fear. Veterans First Act Mr. President, this Nation has made a sacred promise to the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. These folks answered a call to duty, and they made selfless sacrifices to protect the freedoms we all enjoy. These heroes stood up for us, and now it is time for the Senate to stand up for them. Two years ago, when reports surfaced that veterans were dying while waiting to receive care at the VA, the Senate acted swiftly, and we passed legislation to build the capacity of the VA to better meet the needs of veterans now and into the future. Also included in that bill was the Veterans Choice Program, which allowed more veterans to seek care in their own community when they were unable to get timely care from the VA. Unfortunately, the Choice Program is broken. We have heard this from veterans and community leaders, from veteran service organizations, from Republicans and from Democrats. The intent of the Choice Program was a good one--to get veterans care more quickly--but the rollout has been disastrous, causing far too many veterans to wait even longer for an appointment. But because of the leadership of Chairman Isakson and Ranking Member Blumenthal, the Veterans' Affairs Committee came together in May and approved the Veterans First Act, which includes provisions that I and Senator Burr authored to fix the Choice Program. It also includes critical provisions to hold the VA accountable, increase veterans access to care both inside and outside the VA, and better deliver on the commitment this Nation has made to the folks who have served. Since this bill was unanimously passed out of committee back on May 16, it has fallen victim to politics as usual, and a combination of anonymous holds and the majority leader's decision not to bring it to the floor have put this bipartisan piece of legislation, this good piece of legislation for our veterans, in limbo. And now there are only 21 days left until the Senate is set to recess for nearly 2 months. I am concerned that the clock is running out and that this bipartisan bill will fall victim to the Senate's inaction. We cannot let business as usual here in Washington, DC, derail critically needed reforms. Veterans will not and should not accept excuses for the Senate not acting. This is a good bill. It is a bill that gives the VA the flexibility to work directly with community providers to connect veterans to the care they need so that the VA does not need to work through a middleman. This bill also provides the budget flexibility necessary to ensure veterans are routed to care in a manner that makes the most sense for them. It imposes stricter rules to ensure the VA is reimbursing community providers in a more timely manner. It also includes critical provisions that I helped author to ensure the VA is able to more quickly fill leadership vacancies at VA medical facilities. That is why today I am calling on the Senate to put politics aside, put personal agendas aside, and get this bill to the floor for debate and for an up-or-down vote. The millions of veterans who are still being forced to wait more than 30 days to schedule an appointment deserve that vote. The veterans who are still kept on long wait lists deserve that vote. And the folks who have sacrificed so much to protect and defend this country deserve that vote. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mass Shooting in Orlando Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, early in the morning this past Sunday, the worst mass shooting in America's history took place. Forty-nine people were killed and 53 more wounded at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL. We don't know all the details, but we know that this was an act of terror and that it was an act of hate directed at the LGBT community. I want to begin by expressing my condolences to the victims, to their families and loved ones, and to the city of Orlando. I thank the first responders who ran toward the sound of gunfire, who literally risked their lives to save the lives of others. I express my support and solidarity with the LGBT community in Orlando and throughout the Nation. Many of the patrons at the Pulse nightclub were members of that community. They were simply enjoying a fun night out at an establishment that welcomed them. June is Pride Month. It is a month where we should take pride in the advances we have made toward equality since Stonewall in 1969. The LGBT movement has come a long way in protecting Americans' right to love the person they love. Yet this weekend's shooting is a sobering reminder that this community still remains a target of vicious hatred. As we mourn those we lost in Orlando, we must not lose our pride in what the LGBT movement has accomplished. We must stand in solidarity with our fellow LGBT Americans who will not let the hate of a few overcome the love of an entire community. The shooter who perpetrated this horrific attack has been identified as a 29-year-old U.S. citizen who was living in St. Lucie County, FL. The shooter reportedly entered the nightclub at about 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and a handgun. He opened fire on the patrons and engaged in a shoot-out with an off-duty Orlando police officer who was working security at the nightclub. The shooter apparently held a number of hostages in the nightclub for several hours, until a SWAT team swarmed the building, killing the gunman at about 5 a.m. Reportedly, the shooter called 911 to pledge allegiance to ISIS, even while the attack was under way. We do not yet know when and how this gunman may have been radicalized. Reportedly, he had been the subject of at least two FBI investigations in recent years regarding possible ties to terrorist groups. The shooter reportedly bought the two guns he used on Sunday within the last several days. He was able to buy these guns legally, despite the past [[Page S3821]] investigations into his potential terrorist ties. Let's be clear. In America, our laws currently allow dangerous people to buy guns. That has to change. I respect the Second Amendment to our Constitution. That amendment protects the responsible use of guns for lawful purposes. But the Supreme Court has made it clear that it is constitutional to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Our lawmakers are simply not doing enough to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Right now, the FBI cannot stop a known or suspected terrorist from walking into a gunshop and walking out with an AR-15, an assault weapon. The GAO found that between 2004 and 2014, suspected terrorists bought guns lawfully at least 2,043 times from American gun dealers. What are we thinking? Last December, when the Senate took up this measure, we failed on the floor of the Senate to pass legislation to close this terror gap loophole. The gap remains open, and we have failed to close the gaping loopholes in our own background check system that allow terrorists, criminals, and others to get guns without a background check from gun shows or over the Internet. Why do we make it so easy for people that we suspect of being involved in terrorism to buy guns--assault weapons, military-style guns? Last December, this Senate failed again to pass Manchin-Toomey, a bill that would close many of these loopholes. This was a bipartisan bill, yet we couldn't pass it on the floor of the Senate. We know our weak gun laws make us vulnerable, but we have not acted to strengthen them. In fact, almost every week we see efforts in Congress to further weaken gun laws in America. Hundreds of men, women, and children are shot every day in America, and on average 91 of those victims die. It is an epidemic of gun violence that has devastated families and communities in every State. No community has been hit harder than the city of Chicago--the city I am honored to represent and the city I love and a city where this past weekend, 44 people were shot, 7 of them fatally. More than 1,650 people have been shot so far this year in Chicago, with at least 282 victims dying from their wounds. The tragedy of Orlando is that it all happened in a few hours. The tragedy of gun violence in Chicago is that it happens almost every day. Across the Nation, we have seen Americans gunned down in nightclubs, elementary schools, churches, temples, movie theaters, health care clinics, malls, colleges, and our homes and our neighborhoods. We need to wake up and act to reduce this violence. Thoughts and prayers are important but not sufficient. We need votes and laws to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Can't we agree on that? The responsibility lies right here. We have that responsibility and that opportunity. This weekend's act of hate and terror in Orlando has been condemned by Americans of all backgrounds and all faiths, and Orlando has received an extraordinary outpouring of support and solidarity from all across the United States and around the world. We do stand united against ISIS and its efforts to promote mass shootings and acts of terror. We stand in support of the LGBT community--the latest target of this terrorist attack. This solidarity is important. Our efforts to defeat ISIS and keep America safe from hate and terror are strengthened when our Nation and the world stand united. We must not let the actions of a hateful few divide us and prevent us from working together to combat this evil. We also must not let this act of hate and terror lead to hostility against the Muslim community in America. The American Muslim community has stood with all Americans in condemning Sunday's mass shooting. American Muslim leaders immediately spoke out and condemned the attack. Muslim Floridians donated blood and money to help the victims and survivors. In the coming days, there will be those who say we should respond to this attack by discriminating against innocent American Muslims and immigrants. But the solution to hate is not more hate; it is unity. In Orlando, they understand this. In a news conference after the shooting, a representative of Equality Florida recognized the unity between the LGBT and Muslim communities, stating that his organization ``stands in solidarity with the Muslim and Islamic community in opposition to the intolerance, discrimination, and hate crimes that both of our communities experience.'' That was a statement by the representative of Equality Florida about Muslims in Florida itself. It is unfortunate that the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, Donald Trump, does not understand this. In response to the Orlando attack, Mr. Trump wasted no time calling again for a ban on all Muslims immigrating to the United States. General Michael Hayden is no softy, no liberal. He was Director of the CIA, and the National Security Agency under President George W. Bush. Here is what General Hayden said of Mr. Trump's response to the attack: ``Prejudiced, simplistic, and frankly inaccurate.'' General Hayden has pointed out that banning all Muslim immigration would not make us safer and actually helps ISIS recruit those who hate the United States. As we mourn those we have lost, we must also roll up our sleeves and get to work. We must pursue smart, commonsense reforms to keep dangerous, hateful people from getting their hands on dangerous weapons. America just suffered its deadliest mass shooting event in history--worse than San Bernardino, worse than Newtown, worse than Virginia Tech. If there was ever a time for Congress to do its job and keep guns out of dangerous hands, this is it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first and foremost, I wish to send my heartfelt sympathy to those who have lost loved ones in Orlando, FL, in Orange County, yesterday in a tragic event. I want to express my great appreciation to the people of Orlando who volunteered their blood, their families, and their houses to help support those victims; to the EMTs who rushed into harm's way to save lives--and they did save lives--and to the hospital trauma team that did an amazing job of responding instantaneously to a tragedy beyond anybody's comprehension. We are very sad in America today by the terrible attack that took place and those who would perpetrate it. I, for one, am going to roll up my sleeves and work to see to it that wherever radical Islamic terrorism is, I want to root it out and I want to destroy it. You cannot accept or tolerate what happened yesterday, and we must redouble our effort to follow it wherever it leads us and to wipe it out and to eradicate it. I, as one Senator, will promise to do that. Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations Bill Mr. President, I am one of those guys who usually is very supportive of going to cloture and going on motions to proceed on just about anything because I think the Senate is the most deliberative body in the world and we ought to do that. But tomorrow, shortly after 11 o'clock, I am going to vote no on the motion to proceed to the Commerce-Justice-Science bill. I want to memorialize why on the floor of the Senate tonight so everybody is clear and understands. There is report language in the Commerce-Justice-Science portion of the appropriations bill that directly interjects this Congress, this Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives into a tristate water compact misunderstanding among the States of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida that has gone on for 27 years. I know that is of no interest to the Presiding Officer from Indiana, nor to the Senator who just preceded me from Chicago, IL, nor anybody else, but what is of interest to you would be any time that Congress decided to interject its nose in your business. Tomorrow, if the motion to proceed brings it to the floor, it will be injecting 100 Senators into an issue among 6 Senators. That is not the right way to do it. In fact, the tristate water compact, which has been off and on in negotiations for 26 years, [[Page S3822]] is at its closest point of being finally decided in a court of law. The judge and the special master recently notified us that they will hear the final case on the tristate water compact in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida this November. So the issue is going to be resolved. We have no place as a Senate or as a Congress to inject ourselves into a case that is pending litigation in the courts between States on issues that are purely theirs--except for the fact that over the years, for nefarious reasons and unpleasant reasons, sometimes Congress has from time to time thwarted water control manuals, thwarted the authority of the Corps of Engineers from doing its job, all over litigation of the ACF and AC basins in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama. I want to bring a resolution. I want all the States to have an adequate supply of water. I want us to be cooperative and work together, and I want us to do it the right way. The right way is to not interject ourselves at the last minute in an appropriations bill with nefarious language that can't be touched that is in the report language but, instead, to pull that language out, as I will try to do with an amendment on the floor. If I am unsuccessful, I will try to do an amendment that counteracts that language, to see to it that Congress does not stick its nose in a place that it does not belong. I like to be cooperative. I like to move forward. I don't want to slow down progress. But I was sent here to represent 10.4 million people in the State of Georgia and, by golly, I am going to do it. If somebody is trying to inject themselves beyond the appropriate place, I am going to do everything I can to stop them. The way I will start that tomorrow will be to vote no on the motion to proceed to go to the Commerce-Justice-Science bill. I yield back my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mass Shooting in Orlando Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the horror of Orlando, and I know so many Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle have been thinking about those who lost their lives and talking about this horror that once again has impacted everyone from one end of America to the other. I won't speak for a long time tonight other than to say--which I think is plainly evident from the evidence we have right now at this point in the investigation--that this was first an act of terror and it was also an act of hate. I think both are significant because of the impact they have on our country over time. I think there is a strong belief that the first thing we must do is to express not just condolence but solidarity with the people of Orlando, the people of Florida, and to do what we can to help them and help those communities and families who lost so much in such a short timeframe. At last count, there are 50 dead and more than 50 injured. There will be some who say that beyond that, there is not much we can do, that we should just stay where we are now and not change the laws. I don't agree with that, and I won't dwell on a long list tonight, but I hope at some point we can begin to reengage on a number of issues and at least have a full debate and also a series of votes on a couple of measures which I think are common sense. These are issues that we voted on I believe most recently in 2013, and I was hoping we would vote on them after that. One of the votes had to do with a ban on military-style weapons. I think it would be appropriate to at least debate and vote on it. I would vote in favor of it, and some would not. We should certainly have a vote on the size of the clips, or the magazines. To put it plainly, how many bullets should one person have in their possession or as part of the weapon at any one time? Should someone be allowed to go into any kind of establishment and start shooting, thereby releasing rounds and rounds of ammunition and hundreds and hundreds of bullets? Should that be permitted to anyone at any time or anywhere? I don't think so. If someone is on the terror watch list and that person has been deemed so dangerous that we have labeled him or her as a terrorist or potential terrorist and he or she can't get on an airplane, certainly that person should not have a weapon. That seems to make sense. If they are too dangerous to get on a plane because of their tendency to commit acts of violence or engage in terror, they shouldn't be able to have a firearm. I think it would make sense to have a debate and vote on that issue. Another issue is background checks. That was one measure where there was a lot of consensus or substantial bipartisan support, but it didn't pass in 2013. I hope we can have another vote on that. If a person is not able to get through a background check due to a whole variety of reasons, such as having a criminal record or otherwise, you have to ask yourself, should someone with a criminal record have access to a firearm? Mr. President, today I have introduced the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, S. 3053. That is a new proposal to do what some States have done already. I think it is essential to add this to the other pieces of legislation that have been talked about and some that I just itemized. This bill, first of all, would define what a misdemeanor hate crime is because the intent of the bill is to say: If you are convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime, you shouldn't have access to a firearm. This category of misdemeanors would be under Federal, State, or tribal law that are found to be motivated, at least in part, by hate or bias against the victim's race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. In essence, these eight categories are what some would call, to use the more legal jargon, the protected classes. That is how we would define a misdemeanor hate crime. This bill, upon passage, would keep firearms out of the hands of those convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes. It would prohibit the purchase, possession, or shipment of a firearm by anyone convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime. That is the basics of the bill. Obviously it doesn't have direct application to what happened in Orlando; however, upon further investigation, we may find that it does. Part of the reason for this is because there has been a rise not only in hate crimes but in hate groups across the country, with hundreds more in just the last couple of years, and literally thousands more, if not more, hate crimes have been committed. Those issues I mentioned are among the many things we need to address. I also think that in addition to taking these steps on commonsense gun measures, we have to make sure law enforcement has the resources it needs to take on the challenge of not just criminal activity but increasingly almost terroristic activity within our communities--the so-called lone wolf terrorist, the homegrown terrorist, the individual who is self-radicalized, which seems to be part of the horror of Orlando. We have to make sure that if law enforcement professionals tell us they need more money in the COPS Program, we should appropriate more money. If the law enforcement professionals say: Please fund that program that has worked for so many years, such as the Byrne Justice assistance grants, we should make sure they have those appropriations. If you are tough on law enforcement-- that is nice to say, but it is better to prove it by how you vote. Finally, of course, we have to continue to focus on what is a major component, of course, of Orlando and San Bernardino and so many other places, and that is violent extremism in communities across the country. We have to make sure we are working with local law enforcement and Federal authorities not only to give them the resources they need but to be able to coordinate and do our best to unearth plots before they transpire and to be able to take this fight directly to a terrorist, many of whom are in our midst here in the United States. [[Page S3823]] We have a lot to do. It is not simply a question of what we do on a series of commonsense gun measures, it is also a question of what we are going to do to help our law enforcement and to work as hard as we can in a bipartisan way to debate and vote on measures that will keep our country safe and protect our homeland. Unfortunately, we are seeing more and more of a rise in these individuals who are, as I mentioned before, self-radicalized and sometimes categorized as a lone wolf. We have to make sure we are doing everything possible to identify them, apprehend them, and make sure we are thwarting these plots ahead of time. It may not work in every instance, but we have to take every measure possible. I think part of that is doing what I hope we can do as a matter of preventive steps. If someone is engaging in hate and taking action against others, even if it only rises to the level of a misdemeanor, they shouldn't have access to a firearm. We want to nip this in the bud, stop it long before that hate continues and develops into the kind of hate that leads to a much greater and more lethal attack on Americans. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3815-S3823] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 2943, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 2943) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. Pending: McCain amendment No. 4607, to amend the provision on share- in-savings contracts. Reed (for Reid) amendment No. 4603 (to amendment No.4607), to change the enactment date. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida. Mass Shooting in Orlando Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I have just returned from the command center of the emergency operations center, a temporary one that has been set up in the middle of South Orange Avenue, very close to the Pulse nightclub, not far from the hospital where so many of the victims have been taken, where 9 of the victims died in the care of the doctors, and where there are up to 50 people, some of whom are still fighting for their lives. Needless to say, Orlando is shocked. We didn't know a place that sometimes [[Page S3816]] is called the happiest place on Earth could be one of the saddest places on Earth. Indeed, the morning's Orlando Sentinel, the entire front page is dedicated to a statement by the paper entitled ``Our Community Will Heal.'' Will our community heal? Well, certainly, in what we see with the long lines snaking around the block at the blood donation center, where it is literally going around what would be the length of 2 blocks, and where there are people standing in the hot Sun with umbrellas to donate blood, that says something about how the community will heal. Indeed, when we had our office in Orlando opened on Sunday, the kinds of calls expressing grief and shock and just disbelief, along with the messages of comfort, has been quite a contrast to the 95 percent of the hundreds and hundreds of calls the Orlando office has received today. Ninety-five percent of those calls have been hateful. What does that say about us as a nation? Will we, in fact, heal? What does it say about us as a nation deep inside? Have we lost the teachings in almost all the major religions--clearly in the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament and clearly in the New Testament, as well as in the Koran. You will recognize these words if I say it in the old English: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Putting it in modern English, it means to treat others as you would want to be treated. Yet what we find is that in our society today there are folks who want to divide instead of unify, and this killer is a good example. I have spent two days with the FBI. I have been on the phone. I have talked to the Secretary of Homeland Security. I have talked to our intelligence community. It is this Senator's opinion that once the dots are completely connected--and they are being rapidly connected. The FBI is doing a great job. They are the lead in Orlando. By the way, talking about something good, what about the cooperation and coordination, which has been almost seamless, among local, State, and Federal Government officials, all represented down there in the command center, all being represented as a number of us went in front of the assembled cameras? It seems that is a good thing. That is unity. That is how we do things in America. Yet, as the dots are being connected, we will find out that, yes, this shooter was ISIS-inspired--and that is a whole set of issues--and how are we going to protect ourselves in the future? But we are also going to find that this shooter was inspired by hatred, and we are going to find that this hatred was directed, as his father already said in interviews, toward the gay community. So here again, we have another terrible tragedy. I have had a number of calls from my fellow Senators. One of those calls came from Richard Blumenthal. He is from Connecticut. He has reason to be sensitive about this because of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, where 20 children and some 6 adults were gunned down needlessly. Maybe that was a mental case. Maybe part of this one in Orlando is a mental case. But it is driven by hatred, maybe through ISIS, a hatred of America and of a free society being willing to be able to speak what you want without fear of persecution, or maybe it is a hatred about a group of people. It is exactly the opposite of what is taught in all of the Scriptures. So as we heal in Orlando, it will take a while. You can imagine those families of the ones who have been lost. You can imagine the families down in the Orlando Health hospital right now, grieving, hoping, and praying that those victims fighting for their lives are going to make it. So America, we are going to have to dig down deep and find out who we really are. You know, I really know who we are. We are a people with a character that is compassionate, generous, kind, and respectful. We as Americans are ladies and gentlemen. We can express ourselves as has been the tradition on the floor of this Senate in the heat of political debate. We can sharply differ, but we can be respectful of the other fellow's point of view. That is America, and until we finally come to the conclusion and insist that this aberrant behavior be stopped--until that happens--we will still be grieving. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Madam President. I rise to echo the sentiments of the Senator from Florida. His State has suffered an unspeakable tragedy. It is something that unfortunately brings together two terrible biases--one against the LGBT community and the other a religiously based radical attack inspired by ISIS at that nightclub. They all came together. To the Senator and to everyone from Florida, our deepest, deepest sympathies go to you. It was, of course, something that was understood in Massachusetts. He mentioned the Tsarnaev brothers as an inspiration to him. They struck on Patriots Day in 2013 in the United States. Mohamed Atta and the other nine hijackers were in Boston when they hijacked the two planes from Logan International Airport. So we know those people are out there. We know that their hate-filled message is intended to kill innocent Americans, and we saw it once again. Unfortunately, the target was a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. But for us, I think we have to learn from this. This man had been investigated as a terrorist suspect, and yet we are blocked--the Senator from Florida and I and others--from passing a law that would prevent anyone on a terror watch list from buying a gun in these United States. It is not against the law. The National Rifle Association has enough power here on the floor of the Senate to prohibit someone who is on a terror watch list from buying guns in the United States of America. We need another vote on that issue here in the Senate. We need to give the protections to the American people for them to know that someone on a terror watch list cannot buy a gun in the United States of America. We also have to ban these military-style assault weapons, like the AR-15, which are the guns of choice for those who seek to inflict mass casualties on civilians. These are not weapons that belong on the streets of our country. They belong in combat overseas, not in our communities. They don't belong in Newtown, they don't belong in San Bernardino, and they don't belong in Orlando. They don't belong in our streets or in our schools or in a civilized society, yet we cannot ban these weapons from being sold in the United States of America. We have to prevent any known or suspected terrorist from buying firearms, and we have to make it impossible, as well, for them to buy these assault weapons. This is our challenge now. Once again, we are warned. Once again, we are told what the weapon of choice is. Once again, we know that they are going to target us if we make it easy for them to access these weapons. How many warnings do we need? The NRA really should stand for ``not relevant anymore'' in American politics. They should not control the agenda here on the floor of the Senate. We should be able to ban people on the terror watch list from buying guns. We should be able to ban these assault weapons from being sold at all inside of our country. The Senate leadership should stop banning a vote here on the Senate floor on ensuring that we do the research at the CDC on this relationship between mental health and the use of guns within our society. The bill that I have introduced calls for $10 million a year for the next 6 years. We can't even get the money to research gun violence in the United States of America. It doesn't have to be this way. We can change. We can learn these lessons, but we can't wait any longer to put those commonsense gun laws on the books. We cannot wait any longer to make our streets safer. So let's close the gun show loophole that allows anyone to go into one of these Kmarts full of killing machines and buy a gun without a background check. Let's close the loophole that allows domestic abusers to buy guns. Let's close the loophole that allows straw purchasers to buy guns and flood our streets with them. Let's repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and take away the gun manufacturers' immunity from civil liability. PLCAA should stand for ``protecting lives, creating arms accountability,'' not protecting these arms manufacturers from liability if these guns are used to kill innocent people in our society. [[Page S3817]] So in the coming days and weeks, you can be assured that the National Rifle Association will be opposed to even these limited commonsense gun measures. The NRA has had a stranglehold over Congress for far too long. It is time to end its reign of power. It is time to end its viselike grip on the safety and security of our Nation. Those in Congress who do not support these commonsense measures are siding with those forces that make it easier for these massacres to happen. That is the bottom line of where we are. Now is the time to stand up for the families of Columbine, of Newtown, of Aurora, of Chattanooga, of Charleston, of San Bernardino, and now of Orlando, and of all of the cities across our country, which are saying: Enough is enough. I was so proud on Saturday to march in the Boston Gay Pride Parade. It was a joyous occasion where love, community, and social justice were all celebrated with a passion and a real sense of progress. But as I woke up the next morning, I saw again how an individual armed with guns and fueled by extremist ideology can fuel violence and terror. We are a nation of hope, not hatred. After this tragedy, after this deplorable attack, let's denounce hate in all of its forms. Let's stand with the LGBT community and raise our voices with dignity, equality, and love. Let's say no to the rhetoric of hate that demonizes our friends and neighbors because of their faith, sexual orientation, or because of their country of origin. Let's recommit to justice and moving progress forward. The American people are begging, pleading for this institution to enact commonsense gun safety measures. My hope is that the Senate can succeed where it has recently failed and muster the political will and courage to deliver badly needed reform of our gun laws. Let's work together to do this and to help prevent yet another mass shooting in our country. I yield back. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Madam President, it is good to see the Presiding Officer this afternoon. This past weekend, Saturday, my wife and I went to New York City at the invitation of one of our sons. We visited the 9/11 Memorial in New York, literally erected on the site of the World Trade Center. I must confess it was emotionally charging, very saddening, and at the same time uplifting and inspiring. I never imagined that within the space of less than 24 hours we would see dozens of our young have their lives taken from them. I remember walking through the 9/11 Memorial--and for those who have not been, I urge you to go. For those who have, you probably remember going through parts of the memorial and literally seeing the faces of 3,000 men, women, and some children whose lives were snuffed out that day some 15 years ago. Every one of them had moms and dads. They had grandparents. A number of them had children, spouses, brothers, sisters, cousins, nephews, and nieces. Those families struggle even today with their loss. The young people who died Saturday night, Sunday morning in a nightclub in Orlando, like those many folks whose faces we saw on Saturday, also have moms and dads, grandmoms, granddads, brothers, sisters, and cousins. Their families are mourning today just like others did 15 years ago. What I want to do is preface my remarks by reaching out across the miles to the families who are mourning, trying to deal with their losses, and let them know that we want to take you in our loving embrace. To the best of our ability, we also want to make sure we continue to take steps in this country to ensure we reduce the likelihood that these kinds of attacks are going to occur and that when they do, if they do, we are better prepared to deal with them. The killer, the man who took the lives of 49 people, demonstrated an act of hatred--in part, an act of terrorism but really an act of hatred. The question is, What do we do about it? Some would have us close our borders, the ability to come here even on a short-term basis: If you happen to be Muslim, we are going to keep you out. That is exactly what ISIS would like for us to do. There are 3.3 million Muslims in this country. The idea of somehow turning them against the rest of us, that is the kind of thing happening in some parts of Europe. Unlike Europe, we are a country where we accept the people who come to our shores. We accept them. When you were a stranger in my land, did you take me in? For us, for years, for decades, and for a couple of centuries, the answer has been yes. That doesn't mean we shouldn't very carefully check and test the backgrounds of the people who come here to make sure they are who they say they are, that they are not on a terrorist watch list. We have a bunch of those. We want to make sure our agencies and our terrorist watch lists are coordinated. We want to make sure our intelligence agencies are in close communication with one another. Part of the goal of ISIS is to make this a clash between the United States and the Muslim population here, 3.3 million people, and around the world. That is not what we should do. We should be smarter than that. One of the things we need to do is to continue the work that was begun from last year--I have said it often, I am going to say it again--to degrade and destroy those who would do us harm. Those who would do us enormous harm are trying to set up a caliphate. They are somehow using their religion, bastardizing their religion, and making it say things it doesn't even begin to say. What we need to do is make sure they get no further. The progress that has been made in terms of rolling them back was with the help of a coalition that includes 15 nations--16 nations. We are taking back a lot of the land and about to--I hope--take Fallujah and Mosul and continue there. When ISIS wannabes pop up in other countries, the idea is to work with our coalition in the countries that ISIS is trying to get a foothold in and make sure they are not successful. So it is a little like Whac-a-Mole--but it is not a game--and it is one we want to make sure they don't get a chance to get started there. If you look at the amount of money--ISIS used to make a lot of money selling oil. They take over oil refineries and oilfields, and they sell the oil on the black market. We have greatly diminished their ability to do that and greatly diminished their ability to make money. In some cases, we have figured out where they are keeping their cash stored, and we have gone in and destroyed literally hundreds of millions of dollars in their currency that they were harboring. There are a number of people coming from around the world to go to that part of the world--Iraq, Syria--who want to be ISIS volunteers. It is greatly diminished from what it was. It is down from 2,000 a month this time maybe last year to something that is just a fraction of that. In the United States not that long ago, early this year, maybe six people a month were going from the United States to the Middle East to be part of ISIS, and they are down to maybe one per month. It is still one too many, but we are headed in the right direction. The people who are being radicalized here by ISIS, ISIS is not sending people here to radicalize them. ISIS is basically trying to do this through social media, to use the Internet, and they are pretty good at it, but one of the things that will make them not so effective is once we demonstrate--and I think we are on our way to doing that-- that ISIS is a losing team. The people who are apparently claiming credit for it--or the killer in this case who killed all of our folks over the weekend, he was looking for a winning team. He is not a person who had a lot of wins in his life, and he wanted to be a part of a winning team. Our challenge is to make sure that anybody who is looking for a winning team or thinks they can, through radicalization, attacks, and terrorism--we need to make sure they know they are barking up the wrong tree. ISIS is a losing team. One of the ways we can do that is--the Presiding Officer along with me and a number of others on the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs have been all over this issue for years. It led to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. We continue to stay right on this issue, and we will probably be doing that for as long as any of us are in the Senate. [[Page S3818]] Part of what we should be doing, aside from degrading and destroying ISIS--if we are smart, one of the things we need to do is reach out to the Muslim community in this country, unlike what has happened in places in Europe, where you have a lot of Muslim folks who are all segregated. They are not part of the culture. They are not welcomed so much in those countries. One of the things about us in America is we are a melting pot. We have been a melting pot forever. When I was a stranger in your land, did you take me in? For years, we said the answer is yes. The Department of Homeland Security has asked for authorization to be able to create our community partnership, to reach out to Muslim communities across America, to meet with parents, with young people, not so young people, face the community, and make it clear they are a part of this country, make sure they say to their own people, their own young people: Don't do this. Don't do what this guy did over the weekend in Orlando. That is not part of our religion. It is not part of their religion. Don't go there. The third thing we can do and ought to be doing is to strengthen our defenses at home. We had an active shooter situation for hours into the wee hours of Saturday evening to Sunday morning, an active shooter situation. It is not the first active shooter situation we have faced. They are not easy to deal with. One of the things the Department of Homeland Security can do, is doing, and ought to be doing more of, if given the resources, is doing active shooter training in police agencies all over the United States. If they ever face a situation such as this, they know what to do and they are able to be effective and save lives. The other thing I would mention in terms of resources, as the Presiding Officer knows, we put a fair amount of resources toward a fusion center. Sometimes people used to call them confusion centers, but actually they are a fusion center. They give the ability to State and local law enforcement agencies to work with the Feds to better ensure that information gathered locally works its way up the channel, up through the chain of command, to be shared nationally with other States and with the Federal Government, and to make sure the converse is true, to the extent that we gather useful information at the national level, international level, that we bring it down and we funnel it back into individual States through fusion centers so they act on that actionable intelligence. We need to work with energy in this regard. We need to work with a sense of urgency. We need to make sure, as we go through the appropriations process in the Senate in the days and weeks ahead, that we are putting resources, financial resources, where they need to go. A number of folks have asked me in interviews yesterday and today: What should we be doing about gun control? How does all of this relate to gun control? The answer is, I am not sure how this is going to affect the way we view guns. I believe in the Second Amendment right. I am sure the Presiding Officer does, a former Army colonel, retired colonel. I am a retired Navy captain, a Vietnam veteran. My dad was a chief petty officer in World War II and served for a long time as a chief petty officer in the Reserves after that. My dad was a hunter. He came from a family of hunters and taught me to be a hunter and a fisherman. One of the proudest possessions I own is a shotgun my grandfather gave me before he died. When I was in the Navy, I used to go back on leave from Southeast Asia, go visit my parents near Clearwater, FL, and stay in a guest bedroom. In the guest bedroom, under my bed where I slept, were guns. I opened the closet in the guestroom for my clothes, and there were guns. My father, in addition to being a hunter, actually bought and sold guns. He would basically sell them to people he knew. He felt they were not people who were mentally unstable or people who were felons, but he believed in the Second Amendment right. My dad also believed in common sense. My dad is now deceased, but if he were alive and he heard that people who are on terrorism watch lists can literally buy weapons, including assault weapons, automatic weapons, he would say: That doesn't make any sense. If he found out we could go to a gun show, and a person who is mentally unstable, has a history of mental illness, and maybe someone who is a convicted felon could actually walk into a gun show and go to a federally registered gun dealer, be denied the ability to purchase an assault weapon, and then go to the next table over with someone who is not a federally registered gun dealer and purchase the same weapon they had just been denied, in terms of what makes sense and doesn't make sense to my dad and frankly to me--his son--those situations don't make a whole lot of sense. Those are areas we ought to agree on. One of our colleagues, as the Presiding Officer knows, Senator Enzi from Wyoming, likes to talk about the 80-20 rule. It is a great rule. It says there is about 80 percent of the stuff we agree on and maybe 20 percent of an issue we don't agree on. What we should do is focus on the 80 percent we agree on. My hope is--most Americans get it, in terms of making sure that folks who are on the terrorist watch list don't have access to buy weapons. They get it. I think they also get the idea that this gun show loophole is something that ought to be closed as well. I close by saying, in a sense, this is a test of our character as a nation. I said earlier our tradition has always been that we welcome people from disparate places, in some cases people fleeing oppression, lack of freedom, lack of religious opportunities and freedom of worship. That is the way we operate as a country. You don't open and read the Constitution--it doesn't say Matthew 25 because we decided we are not going to establish a religion here. If we did, Matthew 25 says: When I was hungry, did you feed me? When I was thirsty, did you give me to drink? When I was naked, did you clothe me? When I was a stranger in your land, did you take me in? I think we have a moral obligation to the least of these, including those who are fleeing oppression in other places looking for an opportunity for a new life. I think we have a moral obligation to welcome them, but we have a moral obligation to those who live here, to make sure that as we welcome people from other places, we do not imperil them by those who arrive from other shores. The last thing I would say is, we need the kind of leadership in this body that seeks to really do what it says right over the Presiding Officer's head, where the Presiding Officer is sitting. The Latin words--I don't know a lot of Latin words but ``e pluribus unum''--from many, one. Those are words that we would be wise to remember from this day as we go forward. I think that is pretty much what I wanted to say. As this week goes on, I ask that my colleagues and I find out as much as we can, learn as much as we can, find out what went right and what went wrong, and do more of what went right. And at the end of the day, let's make sure we are true to the values on which this country was built. I thank the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank our colleague for his words. I certainly join him in mourning the horrible, tragic loss of life this weekend in Orlando. Certainly I am committed, along with all our colleagues, to fighting terror wherever it exists and whomever it targets. This was absolutely horrible. Mr. President, I also rise today in support of a really important piece of bipartisan legislation that I have been working on with Senator Shaheen. I have introduced it to reauthorize the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Programs-- two vital small business programs in the Federal Government. We have an opportunity to accomplish this--to fully reauthorize and improve these programs--in the context of this Defense authorization bill that is on the floor now. I am very hopeful we are going to do that as part of a managers' package to the bill. These two programs--the Small Business Innovation Research and the Small Business Technology Transfer Programs--are really vital and useful to the success of small businesses directly responsible for creating thousands, tens of thousands of new jobs. By funding small businesses and entrepreneurs in the critical early stages [[Page S3819]] of R&D, these programs allow firms to drive the innovation sector of the economy with new ideas and technologies. Very rarely have government programs had such a clear and measurable, positive and stimulating effect on the economy. SBIR and STTR are also crucial to Federal agencies as they solve many of our biggest science and technology challenges. Giving small, innovative firms access to already appropriated Federal R&D funding is a win-win--a win for the small business sector and just as importantly a win for the taxpayer and those agencies. These programs exist to foster innovation, to facilitate public- private partnerships, to give firms the funding they need to help 11 Federal departments and agencies meet their R&D needs. These programs not only create jobs, but they also lead to a path for commercialization for many of these businesses, which is absolutely key to their success. These programs have been front and center in improving our Nation's capacity to innovate. Over the course of the SBIR Program history from 1982 to 2014--the last year for which we have numbers--Federal agencies have made more than 152,000 SBIR awards to small businesses to develop innovative technologies, and the total dollar amount awarded--again out of existing R&D budgets--is $42 billion. In 2014 alone, SBIR gave nearly 5,500 Phase I and Phase II awards worth about $2.2 billion, and the SBA is currently reporting an average of 5,000 awards per year. These awards are directly responsible for some of the most popular technologies that are available to the public today. For instance, through an SBIR award from the Air Force, we have created a technology known as LASIK, originally to correct vision for pilots, but that is a widely used technology to correct vision for all Americans. That was an SBIR success. Military armor has been a regular success of the SBIR Programs. ArmorWorks is a great example. That created over 350,000 top-of-the- line body armor plates worn by U.S. service men and women in the United States. Liftware Spoon--a spoon that stabilizes hand tremors for patients with Parkinson's disease and essential tremor--again is a clear, identifiable, and important SBIR success story. HydroMARK decreases patient discomfort with a minimally invasive breast biopsy procedure. With the HydroMARK, a mammogram is no longer necessary and the surgeon or radiologist can use an ultrasound to locate the tumor. This is a huge innovation that has dramatically improved thousands of women's lives and, again, directly out of SBIR. Bioseal reduces lung collapse rates after lung biopsies. iRobot's Roomba is something I can relate to. It is moving around at home when I am there on the weekend. This is the popular autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner that has reached major commercial success, selling over 10 million units. That is directly out of SBIR. These programs we are talking about, which have been so successful, are set to expire September 30 of 2017. As many of my colleagues can attest, it was a tumultuous process to complete the last reauthorization, so we are starting early now so we don't go through that tumultuous process again. Back then--the last reauthorization-- participating agencies and firms had to endure a process that took over 3 years and 14 short-term extensions. In a bipartisan effort with Senator Shaheen, we have been working for the last year to avoid all that and to do this ahead of time so we don't have all of that tumult and uncertainty, which saps the effectiveness of the program for a significant period of time. Reauthorizing these programs this year will ensure stability, foster an environment of innovative entrepreneurship, and avoid that uncertainty by directing more than $200 billion annually to this R&D funding to the Nation's small business firms. As chair of the Senate's Small Business Committee, I have made this a real priority. Senator Shaheen, as ranking member, has done the same. So I thank all of our committee members who are solidly behind this effort. I also thank so many other Members of the Senate who have been cooperative. In the context of this Defense bill, we have cleared our reauthorization amendment with the Senate Committee on Armed Services, and I want to specifically thank Senators McCain and Reed for their leadership. We have cleared it with the Commerce Committee because agencies under the jurisdiction of that committee are involved. We have cleared it with the HELP Committee. They have the same tangential relationship. We are the authorizing committee, but some agencies involved are under their jurisdiction. We have cleared it with everyone in sight, so that means we have a real opportunity to have this in the managers' package--which it is, as I speak--and to pass it through the Defense bill as a full reauthorization. I am also proud to share that not only will our reauthorization annually direct more than $2 billion of Federal R&D to small firms that are most likely to create jobs and commercialize their projects, but it will also establish the Regional SBIR State Collaborative Initiative Pilot Program to help low-participation States attract R&D funding for their businesses. All of this reauthorization is a true consensus effort, so I am grateful to the more than 50 organizations that strongly support it-- among them the Small Business Technology Council, the National Small Business Association and the Defense Alliance, and 47 more. It is a true consensus effort. They all support the effort, as does the leadership of SAS; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; and the Commerce Committee. So it is an important opportunity that we shouldn't let fall through our grasp. Again, I want to stress that reauthorizing this program is an effective way to meet national needs while jump-starting entrepreneurs, growing our economy, and creating jobs. With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this consensus amendment and help ensure that small businesses across the country can operate with long-term certainty and stability, which this amendment will provide. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mass Shooting in Orlando Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, the atrocity that occurred this past weekend in Orlando, FL, was an attack on every American, and my deepest condolences are with the victims and the families of this appalling attack. I am grateful for our law enforcement and the first responders who bravely put their lives on the line to save others. This attack--the deadliest in American history since 9/11--was carried out by a gunman who pledged allegiance to ISIS. There are 49 families who received phone calls this weekend--phone calls we all hope we never receive. There are 49 families who are arranging for funerals this week. They never dreamed they would be put in this position--the tragedy, the sorrow of the mothers, the fathers, the aunts, the uncles, the brothers, the sisters, the grandparents, the cousins, and friends who will all be attending funerals this week. Additionally, there are more than 50 families dealing with family members who were injured, some gravely, who are fighting for their lives as I speak. Montana is a long ways away from Orlando, but I can tell you that last night across our State there were vigils in Great Falls, Helena, Missoula, Bozeman, Butte, and Billings, MT. We stand united with Orlando. This threat of ISIS is continuing to grow each and every day. We need a strong strategy to destroy the growing threat of Islamic extremism-- Islamic extremism on our soil as well. President Obama, what is that strategy? We need to aggressively go after radical jihadists who seek to destroy our way of life and disturb the peace in our communities. The senseless hate of ISIS and radical Islam will not defeat us but, rather, strengthen our resolve and commitment to freedom. We need to remember that this was an act of terror on American soil, that this is a threat we face from radical Islam and ISIS, and that the worst response would be to politicize this and use this tragedy to restrict our constitutional rights and freedoms. We cannot allow dangerous terrorists to hide in our communities. We need to seek them out and ensure they aren't [[Page S3820]] able to inflict harm on our neighbors, our friends, and our families. May God comfort those who have been profoundly affected by this tragedy, and may God protect our men and women who are defending our country both here and abroad every day. We are a strong nation, and together we will protect our country and ensure victory over the terrorists who want to take away our very way of life here in America. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the junior Senator from Montana. I appreciate his coming to the floor today. I rise today with a heavy heart. Since I first heard the horrible news about the senseless act of terrorism in Orlando, the victims, the partners, and the families have been at the center of my thoughts and prayers. But thoughts and prayers are not enough. It is long past time for the Senate to come together and have a conversation about what steps need to be taken to put an end to this violence and hatred. We cannot continue to be crippled by inaction. The Senate needs to come together to strengthen our national security. After attacks like Orlando, we hear folks say ``Never again,'' but actions really do speak louder than words. It is time that we work together to try to prevent these senseless acts of terror and violence. That conversation begins with our national security and what needs to be done to keep our families and our communities safe. There are actions we can take right now to bolster our national security. There is no question that we must pass legislation that keeps guns out of the hands of terrorists. We absolutely do need to secure our borders. And we need to continue to crack down on insider threats by reforming our security clearance process. Intolerance and hate have no place in this country, and as elected leaders, we have a responsibility to ensure that every American can live their life each day free from fear. Veterans First Act Mr. President, this Nation has made a sacred promise to the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. These folks answered a call to duty, and they made selfless sacrifices to protect the freedoms we all enjoy. These heroes stood up for us, and now it is time for the Senate to stand up for them. Two years ago, when reports surfaced that veterans were dying while waiting to receive care at the VA, the Senate acted swiftly, and we passed legislation to build the capacity of the VA to better meet the needs of veterans now and into the future. Also included in that bill was the Veterans Choice Program, which allowed more veterans to seek care in their own community when they were unable to get timely care from the VA. Unfortunately, the Choice Program is broken. We have heard this from veterans and community leaders, from veteran service organizations, from Republicans and from Democrats. The intent of the Choice Program was a good one--to get veterans care more quickly--but the rollout has been disastrous, causing far too many veterans to wait even longer for an appointment. But because of the leadership of Chairman Isakson and Ranking Member Blumenthal, the Veterans' Affairs Committee came together in May and approved the Veterans First Act, which includes provisions that I and Senator Burr authored to fix the Choice Program. It also includes critical provisions to hold the VA accountable, increase veterans access to care both inside and outside the VA, and better deliver on the commitment this Nation has made to the folks who have served. Since this bill was unanimously passed out of committee back on May 16, it has fallen victim to politics as usual, and a combination of anonymous holds and the majority leader's decision not to bring it to the floor have put this bipartisan piece of legislation, this good piece of legislation for our veterans, in limbo. And now there are only 21 days left until the Senate is set to recess for nearly 2 months. I am concerned that the clock is running out and that this bipartisan bill will fall victim to the Senate's inaction. We cannot let business as usual here in Washington, DC, derail critically needed reforms. Veterans will not and should not accept excuses for the Senate not acting. This is a good bill. It is a bill that gives the VA the flexibility to work directly with community providers to connect veterans to the care they need so that the VA does not need to work through a middleman. This bill also provides the budget flexibility necessary to ensure veterans are routed to care in a manner that makes the most sense for them. It imposes stricter rules to ensure the VA is reimbursing community providers in a more timely manner. It also includes critical provisions that I helped author to ensure the VA is able to more quickly fill leadership vacancies at VA medical facilities. That is why today I am calling on the Senate to put politics aside, put personal agendas aside, and get this bill to the floor for debate and for an up-or-down vote. The millions of veterans who are still being forced to wait more than 30 days to schedule an appointment deserve that vote. The veterans who are still kept on long wait lists deserve that vote. And the folks who have sacrificed so much to protect and defend this country deserve that vote. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mass Shooting in Orlando Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, early in the morning this past Sunday, the worst mass shooting in America's history took place. Forty-nine people were killed and 53 more wounded at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL. We don't know all the details, but we know that this was an act of terror and that it was an act of hate directed at the LGBT community. I want to begin by expressing my condolences to the victims, to their families and loved ones, and to the city of Orlando. I thank the first responders who ran toward the sound of gunfire, who literally risked their lives to save the lives of others. I express my support and solidarity with the LGBT community in Orlando and throughout the Nation. Many of the patrons at the Pulse nightclub were members of that community. They were simply enjoying a fun night out at an establishment that welcomed them. June is Pride Month. It is a month where we should take pride in the advances we have made toward equality since Stonewall in 1969. The LGBT movement has come a long way in protecting Americans' right to love the person they love. Yet this weekend's shooting is a sobering reminder that this community still remains a target of vicious hatred. As we mourn those we lost in Orlando, we must not lose our pride in what the LGBT movement has accomplished. We must stand in solidarity with our fellow LGBT Americans who will not let the hate of a few overcome the love of an entire community. The shooter who perpetrated this horrific attack has been identified as a 29-year-old U.S. citizen who was living in St. Lucie County, FL. The shooter reportedly entered the nightclub at about 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and a handgun. He opened fire on the patrons and engaged in a shoot-out with an off-duty Orlando police officer who was working security at the nightclub. The shooter apparently held a number of hostages in the nightclub for several hours, until a SWAT team swarmed the building, killing the gunman at about 5 a.m. Reportedly, the shooter called 911 to pledge allegiance to ISIS, even while the attack was under way. We do not yet know when and how this gunman may have been radicalized. Reportedly, he had been the subject of at least two FBI investigations in recent years regarding possible ties to terrorist groups. The shooter reportedly bought the two guns he used on Sunday within the last several days. He was able to buy these guns legally, despite the past [[Page S3821]] investigations into his potential terrorist ties. Let's be clear. In America, our laws currently allow dangerous people to buy guns. That has to change. I respect the Second Amendment to our Constitution. That amendment protects the responsible use of guns for lawful purposes. But the Supreme Court has made it clear that it is constitutional to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Our lawmakers are simply not doing enough to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Right now, the FBI cannot stop a known or suspected terrorist from walking into a gunshop and walking out with an AR-15, an assault weapon. The GAO found that between 2004 and 2014, suspected terrorists bought guns lawfully at least 2,043 times from American gun dealers. What are we thinking? Last December, when the Senate took up this measure, we failed on the floor of the Senate to pass legislation to close this terror gap loophole. The gap remains open, and we have failed to close the gaping loopholes in our own background check system that allow terrorists, criminals, and others to get guns without a background check from gun shows or over the Internet. Why do we make it so easy for people that we suspect of being involved in terrorism to buy guns--assault weapons, military-style guns? Last December, this Senate failed again to pass Manchin-Toomey, a bill that would close many of these loopholes. This was a bipartisan bill, yet we couldn't pass it on the floor of the Senate. We know our weak gun laws make us vulnerable, but we have not acted to strengthen them. In fact, almost every week we see efforts in Congress to further weaken gun laws in America. Hundreds of men, women, and children are shot every day in America, and on average 91 of those victims die. It is an epidemic of gun violence that has devastated families and communities in every State. No community has been hit harder than the city of Chicago--the city I am honored to represent and the city I love and a city where this past weekend, 44 people were shot, 7 of them fatally. More than 1,650 people have been shot so far this year in Chicago, with at least 282 victims dying from their wounds. The tragedy of Orlando is that it all happened in a few hours. The tragedy of gun violence in Chicago is that it happens almost every day. Across the Nation, we have seen Americans gunned down in nightclubs, elementary schools, churches, temples, movie theaters, health care clinics, malls, colleges, and our homes and our neighborhoods. We need to wake up and act to reduce this violence. Thoughts and prayers are important but not sufficient. We need votes and laws to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Can't we agree on that? The responsibility lies right here. We have that responsibility and that opportunity. This weekend's act of hate and terror in Orlando has been condemned by Americans of all backgrounds and all faiths, and Orlando has received an extraordinary outpouring of support and solidarity from all across the United States and around the world. We do stand united against ISIS and its efforts to promote mass shootings and acts of terror. We stand in support of the LGBT community--the latest target of this terrorist attack. This solidarity is important. Our efforts to defeat ISIS and keep America safe from hate and terror are strengthened when our Nation and the world stand united. We must not let the actions of a hateful few divide us and prevent us from working together to combat this evil. We also must not let this act of hate and terror lead to hostility against the Muslim community in America. The American Muslim community has stood with all Americans in condemning Sunday's mass shooting. American Muslim leaders immediately spoke out and condemned the attack. Muslim Floridians donated blood and money to help the victims and survivors. In the coming days, there will be those who say we should respond to this attack by discriminating against innocent American Muslims and immigrants. But the solution to hate is not more hate; it is unity. In Orlando, they understand this. In a news conference after the shooting, a representative of Equality Florida recognized the unity between the LGBT and Muslim communities, stating that his organization ``stands in solidarity with the Muslim and Islamic community in opposition to the intolerance, discrimination, and hate crimes that both of our communities experience.'' That was a statement by the representative of Equality Florida about Muslims in Florida itself. It is unfortunate that the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, Donald Trump, does not understand this. In response to the Orlando attack, Mr. Trump wasted no time calling again for a ban on all Muslims immigrating to the United States. General Michael Hayden is no softy, no liberal. He was Director of the CIA, and the National Security Agency under President George W. Bush. Here is what General Hayden said of Mr. Trump's response to the attack: ``Prejudiced, simplistic, and frankly inaccurate.'' General Hayden has pointed out that banning all Muslim immigration would not make us safer and actually helps ISIS recruit those who hate the United States. As we mourn those we have lost, we must also roll up our sleeves and get to work. We must pursue smart, commonsense reforms to keep dangerous, hateful people from getting their hands on dangerous weapons. America just suffered its deadliest mass shooting event in history--worse than San Bernardino, worse than Newtown, worse than Virginia Tech. If there was ever a time for Congress to do its job and keep guns out of dangerous hands, this is it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first and foremost, I wish to send my heartfelt sympathy to those who have lost loved ones in Orlando, FL, in Orange County, yesterday in a tragic event. I want to express my great appreciation to the people of Orlando who volunteered their blood, their families, and their houses to help support those victims; to the EMTs who rushed into harm's way to save lives--and they did save lives--and to the hospital trauma team that did an amazing job of responding instantaneously to a tragedy beyond anybody's comprehension. We are very sad in America today by the terrible attack that took place and those who would perpetrate it. I, for one, am going to roll up my sleeves and work to see to it that wherever radical Islamic terrorism is, I want to root it out and I want to destroy it. You cannot accept or tolerate what happened yesterday, and we must redouble our effort to follow it wherever it leads us and to wipe it out and to eradicate it. I, as one Senator, will promise to do that. Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations Bill Mr. President, I am one of those guys who usually is very supportive of going to cloture and going on motions to proceed on just about anything because I think the Senate is the most deliberative body in the world and we ought to do that. But tomorrow, shortly after 11 o'clock, I am going to vote no on the motion to proceed to the Commerce-Justice-Science bill. I want to memorialize why on the floor of the Senate tonight so everybody is clear and understands. There is report language in the Commerce-Justice-Science portion of the appropriations bill that directly interjects this Congress, this Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives into a tristate water compact misunderstanding among the States of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida that has gone on for 27 years. I know that is of no interest to the Presiding Officer from Indiana, nor to the Senator who just preceded me from Chicago, IL, nor anybody else, but what is of interest to you would be any time that Congress decided to interject its nose in your business. Tomorrow, if the motion to proceed brings it to the floor, it will be injecting 100 Senators into an issue among 6 Senators. That is not the right way to do it. In fact, the tristate water compact, which has been off and on in negotiations for 26 years, [[Page S3822]] is at its closest point of being finally decided in a court of law. The judge and the special master recently notified us that they will hear the final case on the tristate water compact in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida this November. So the issue is going to be resolved. We have no place as a Senate or as a Congress to inject ourselves into a case that is pending litigation in the courts between States on issues that are purely theirs--except for the fact that over the years, for nefarious reasons and unpleasant reasons, sometimes Congress has from time to time thwarted water control manuals, thwarted the authority of the Corps of Engineers from doing its job, all over litigation of the ACF and AC basins in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama. I want to bring a resolution. I want all the States to have an adequate supply of water. I want us to be cooperative and work together, and I want us to do it the right way. The right way is to not interject ourselves at the last minute in an appropriations bill with nefarious language that can't be touched that is in the report language but, instead, to pull that language out, as I will try to do with an amendment on the floor. If I am unsuccessful, I will try to do an amendment that counteracts that language, to see to it that Congress does not stick its nose in a place that it does not belong. I like to be cooperative. I like to move forward. I don't want to slow down progress. But I was sent here to represent 10.4 million people in the State of Georgia and, by golly, I am going to do it. If somebody is trying to inject themselves beyond the appropriate place, I am going to do everything I can to stop them. The way I will start that tomorrow will be to vote no on the motion to proceed to go to the Commerce-Justice-Science bill. I yield back my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mass Shooting in Orlando Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the horror of Orlando, and I know so many Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle have been thinking about those who lost their lives and talking about this horror that once again has impacted everyone from one end of America to the other. I won't speak for a long time tonight other than to say--which I think is plainly evident from the evidence we have right now at this point in the investigation--that this was first an act of terror and it was also an act of hate. I think both are significant because of the impact they have on our country over time. I think there is a strong belief that the first thing we must do is to express not just condolence but solidarity with the people of Orlando, the people of Florida, and to do what we can to help them and help those communities and families who lost so much in such a short timeframe. At last count, there are 50 dead and more than 50 injured. There will be some who say that beyond that, there is not much we can do, that we should just stay where we are now and not change the laws. I don't agree with that, and I won't dwell on a long list tonight, but I hope at some point we can begin to reengage on a number of issues and at least have a full debate and also a series of votes on a couple of measures which I think are common sense. These are issues that we voted on I believe most recently in 2013, and I was hoping we would vote on them after that. One of the votes had to do with a ban on military-style weapons. I think it would be appropriate to at least debate and vote on it. I would vote in favor of it, and some would not. We should certainly have a vote on the size of the clips, or the magazines. To put it plainly, how many bullets should one person have in their possession or as part of the weapon at any one time? Should someone be allowed to go into any kind of establishment and start shooting, thereby releasing rounds and rounds of ammunition and hundreds and hundreds of bullets? Should that be permitted to anyone at any time or anywhere? I don't think so. If someone is on the terror watch list and that person has been deemed so dangerous that we have labeled him or her as a terrorist or potential terrorist and he or she can't get on an airplane, certainly that person should not have a weapon. That seems to make sense. If they are too dangerous to get on a plane because of their tendency to commit acts of violence or engage in terror, they shouldn't be able to have a firearm. I think it would make sense to have a debate and vote on that issue. Another issue is background checks. That was one measure where there was a lot of consensus or substantial bipartisan support, but it didn't pass in 2013. I hope we can have another vote on that. If a person is not able to get through a background check due to a whole variety of reasons, such as having a criminal record or otherwise, you have to ask yourself, should someone with a criminal record have access to a firearm? Mr. President, today I have introduced the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, S. 3053. That is a new proposal to do what some States have done already. I think it is essential to add this to the other pieces of legislation that have been talked about and some that I just itemized. This bill, first of all, would define what a misdemeanor hate crime is because the intent of the bill is to say: If you are convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime, you shouldn't have access to a firearm. This category of misdemeanors would be under Federal, State, or tribal law that are found to be motivated, at least in part, by hate or bias against the victim's race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. In essence, these eight categories are what some would call, to use the more legal jargon, the protected classes. That is how we would define a misdemeanor hate crime. This bill, upon passage, would keep firearms out of the hands of those convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes. It would prohibit the purchase, possession, or shipment of a firearm by anyone convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime. That is the basics of the bill. Obviously it doesn't have direct application to what happened in Orlando; however, upon further investigation, we may find that it does. Part of the reason for this is because there has been a rise not only in hate crimes but in hate groups across the country, with hundreds more in just the last couple of years, and literally thousands more, if not more, hate crimes have been committed. Those issues I mentioned are among the many things we need to address. I also think that in addition to taking these steps on commonsense gun measures, we have to make sure law enforcement has the resources it needs to take on the challenge of not just criminal activity but increasingly almost terroristic activity within our communities--the so-called lone wolf terrorist, the homegrown terrorist, the individual who is self-radicalized, which seems to be part of the horror of Orlando. We have to make sure that if law enforcement professionals tell us they need more money in the COPS Program, we should appropriate more money. If the law enforcement professionals say: Please fund that program that has worked for so many years, such as the Byrne Justice assistance grants, we should make sure they have those appropriations. If you are tough on law enforcement-- that is nice to say, but it is better to prove it by how you vote. Finally, of course, we have to continue to focus on what is a major component, of course, of Orlando and San Bernardino and so many other places, and that is violent extremism in communities across the country. We have to make sure we are working with local law enforcement and Federal authorities not only to give them the resources they need but to be able to coordinate and do our best to unearth plots before they transpire and to be able to take this fight directly to a terrorist, many of whom are in our midst here in the United States. [[Page S3823]] We have a lot to do. It is not simply a question of what we do on a series of commonsense gun measures, it is also a question of what we are going to do to help our law enforcement and to work as hard as we can in a bipartisan way to debate and vote on measures that will keep our country safe and protect our homeland. Unfortunately, we are seeing more and more of a rise in these individuals who are, as I mentioned before, self-radicalized and sometimes categorized as a lone wolf. We have to make sure we are doing everything possible to identify them, apprehend them, and make sure we are thwarting these plots ahead of time. It may not work in every instance, but we have to take every measure possible. I think part of that is doing what I hope we can do as a matter of preventive steps. If someone is engaging in hate and taking action against others, even if it only rises to the level of a misdemeanor, they shouldn't have access to a firearm. We want to nip this in the bud, stop it long before that hate continues and develops into the kind of hate that leads to a much greater and more lethal attack on Americans. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3815-S3823] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 2943, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 2943) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. Pending: McCain amendment No. 4607, to amend the provision on share- in-savings contracts. Reed (for Reid) amendment No. 4603 (to amendment No.4607), to change the enactment date. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida. Mass Shooting in Orlando Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I have just returned from the command center of the emergency operations center, a temporary one that has been set up in the middle of South Orange Avenue, very close to the Pulse nightclub, not far from the hospital where so many of the victims have been taken, where 9 of the victims died in the care of the doctors, and where there are up to 50 people, some of whom are still fighting for their lives. Needless to say, Orlando is shocked. We didn't know a place that sometimes [[Page S3816]] is called the happiest place on Earth could be one of the saddest places on Earth. Indeed, the morning's Orlando Sentinel, the entire front page is dedicated to a statement by the paper entitled ``Our Community Will Heal.'' Will our community heal? Well, certainly, in what we see with the long lines snaking around the block at the blood donation center, where it is literally going around what would be the length of 2 blocks, and where there are people standing in the hot Sun with umbrellas to donate blood, that says something about how the community will heal. Indeed, when we had our office in Orlando opened on Sunday, the kinds of calls expressing grief and shock and just disbelief, along with the messages of comfort, has been quite a contrast to the 95 percent of the hundreds and hundreds of calls the Orlando office has received today. Ninety-five percent of those calls have been hateful. What does that say about us as a nation? Will we, in fact, heal? What does it say about us as a nation deep inside? Have we lost the teachings in almost all the major religions--clearly in the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament and clearly in the New Testament, as well as in the Koran. You will recognize these words if I say it in the old English: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Putting it in modern English, it means to treat others as you would want to be treated. Yet what we find is that in our society today there are folks who want to divide instead of unify, and this killer is a good example. I have spent two days with the FBI. I have been on the phone. I have talked to the Secretary of Homeland Security. I have talked to our intelligence community. It is this Senator's opinion that once the dots are completely connected--and they are being rapidly connected. The FBI is doing a great job. They are the lead in Orlando. By the way, talking about something good, what about the cooperation and coordination, which has been almost seamless, among local, State, and Federal Government officials, all represented down there in the command center, all being represented as a number of us went in front of the assembled cameras? It seems that is a good thing. That is unity. That is how we do things in America. Yet, as the dots are being connected, we will find out that, yes, this shooter was ISIS-inspired--and that is a whole set of issues--and how are we going to protect ourselves in the future? But we are also going to find that this shooter was inspired by hatred, and we are going to find that this hatred was directed, as his father already said in interviews, toward the gay community. So here again, we have another terrible tragedy. I have had a number of calls from my fellow Senators. One of those calls came from Richard Blumenthal. He is from Connecticut. He has reason to be sensitive about this because of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, where 20 children and some 6 adults were gunned down needlessly. Maybe that was a mental case. Maybe part of this one in Orlando is a mental case. But it is driven by hatred, maybe through ISIS, a hatred of America and of a free society being willing to be able to speak what you want without fear of persecution, or maybe it is a hatred about a group of people. It is exactly the opposite of what is taught in all of the Scriptures. So as we heal in Orlando, it will take a while. You can imagine those families of the ones who have been lost. You can imagine the families down in the Orlando Health hospital right now, grieving, hoping, and praying that those victims fighting for their lives are going to make it. So America, we are going to have to dig down deep and find out who we really are. You know, I really know who we are. We are a people with a character that is compassionate, generous, kind, and respectful. We as Americans are ladies and gentlemen. We can express ourselves as has been the tradition on the floor of this Senate in the heat of political debate. We can sharply differ, but we can be respectful of the other fellow's point of view. That is America, and until we finally come to the conclusion and insist that this aberrant behavior be stopped--until that happens--we will still be grieving. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Madam President. I rise to echo the sentiments of the Senator from Florida. His State has suffered an unspeakable tragedy. It is something that unfortunately brings together two terrible biases--one against the LGBT community and the other a religiously based radical attack inspired by ISIS at that nightclub. They all came together. To the Senator and to everyone from Florida, our deepest, deepest sympathies go to you. It was, of course, something that was understood in Massachusetts. He mentioned the Tsarnaev brothers as an inspiration to him. They struck on Patriots Day in 2013 in the United States. Mohamed Atta and the other nine hijackers were in Boston when they hijacked the two planes from Logan International Airport. So we know those people are out there. We know that their hate-filled message is intended to kill innocent Americans, and we saw it once again. Unfortunately, the target was a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. But for us, I think we have to learn from this. This man had been investigated as a terrorist suspect, and yet we are blocked--the Senator from Florida and I and others--from passing a law that would prevent anyone on a terror watch list from buying a gun in these United States. It is not against the law. The National Rifle Association has enough power here on the floor of the Senate to prohibit someone who is on a terror watch list from buying guns in the United States of America. We need another vote on that issue here in the Senate. We need to give the protections to the American people for them to know that someone on a terror watch list cannot buy a gun in the United States of America. We also have to ban these military-style assault weapons, like the AR-15, which are the guns of choice for those who seek to inflict mass casualties on civilians. These are not weapons that belong on the streets of our country. They belong in combat overseas, not in our communities. They don't belong in Newtown, they don't belong in San Bernardino, and they don't belong in Orlando. They don't belong in our streets or in our schools or in a civilized society, yet we cannot ban these weapons from being sold in the United States of America. We have to prevent any known or suspected terrorist from buying firearms, and we have to make it impossible, as well, for them to buy these assault weapons. This is our challenge now. Once again, we are warned. Once again, we are told what the weapon of choice is. Once again, we know that they are going to target us if we make it easy for them to access these weapons. How many warnings do we need? The NRA really should stand for ``not relevant anymore'' in American politics. They should not control the agenda here on the floor of the Senate. We should be able to ban people on the terror watch list from buying guns. We should be able to ban these assault weapons from being sold at all inside of our country. The Senate leadership should stop banning a vote here on the Senate floor on ensuring that we do the research at the CDC on this relationship between mental health and the use of guns within our society. The bill that I have introduced calls for $10 million a year for the next 6 years. We can't even get the money to research gun violence in the United States of America. It doesn't have to be this way. We can change. We can learn these lessons, but we can't wait any longer to put those commonsense gun laws on the books. We cannot wait any longer to make our streets safer. So let's close the gun show loophole that allows anyone to go into one of these Kmarts full of killing machines and buy a gun without a background check. Let's close the loophole that allows domestic abusers to buy guns. Let's close the loophole that allows straw purchasers to buy guns and flood our streets with them. Let's repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and take away the gun manufacturers' immunity from civil liability. PLCAA should stand for ``protecting lives, creating arms accountability,'' not protecting these arms manufacturers from liability if these guns are used to kill innocent people in our society. [[Page S3817]] So in the coming days and weeks, you can be assured that the National Rifle Association will be opposed to even these limited commonsense gun measures. The NRA has had a stranglehold over Congress for far too long. It is time to end its reign of power. It is time to end its viselike grip on the safety and security of our Nation. Those in Congress who do not support these commonsense measures are siding with those forces that make it easier for these massacres to happen. That is the bottom line of where we are. Now is the time to stand up for the families of Columbine, of Newtown, of Aurora, of Chattanooga, of Charleston, of San Bernardino, and now of Orlando, and of all of the cities across our country, which are saying: Enough is enough. I was so proud on Saturday to march in the Boston Gay Pride Parade. It was a joyous occasion where love, community, and social justice were all celebrated with a passion and a real sense of progress. But as I woke up the next morning, I saw again how an individual armed with guns and fueled by extremist ideology can fuel violence and terror. We are a nation of hope, not hatred. After this tragedy, after this deplorable attack, let's denounce hate in all of its forms. Let's stand with the LGBT community and raise our voices with dignity, equality, and love. Let's say no to the rhetoric of hate that demonizes our friends and neighbors because of their faith, sexual orientation, or because of their country of origin. Let's recommit to justice and moving progress forward. The American people are begging, pleading for this institution to enact commonsense gun safety measures. My hope is that the Senate can succeed where it has recently failed and muster the political will and courage to deliver badly needed reform of our gun laws. Let's work together to do this and to help prevent yet another mass shooting in our country. I yield back. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Madam President, it is good to see the Presiding Officer this afternoon. This past weekend, Saturday, my wife and I went to New York City at the invitation of one of our sons. We visited the 9/11 Memorial in New York, literally erected on the site of the World Trade Center. I must confess it was emotionally charging, very saddening, and at the same time uplifting and inspiring. I never imagined that within the space of less than 24 hours we would see dozens of our young have their lives taken from them. I remember walking through the 9/11 Memorial--and for those who have not been, I urge you to go. For those who have, you probably remember going through parts of the memorial and literally seeing the faces of 3,000 men, women, and some children whose lives were snuffed out that day some 15 years ago. Every one of them had moms and dads. They had grandparents. A number of them had children, spouses, brothers, sisters, cousins, nephews, and nieces. Those families struggle even today with their loss. The young people who died Saturday night, Sunday morning in a nightclub in Orlando, like those many folks whose faces we saw on Saturday, also have moms and dads, grandmoms, granddads, brothers, sisters, and cousins. Their families are mourning today just like others did 15 years ago. What I want to do is preface my remarks by reaching out across the miles to the families who are mourning, trying to deal with their losses, and let them know that we want to take you in our loving embrace. To the best of our ability, we also want to make sure we continue to take steps in this country to ensure we reduce the likelihood that these kinds of attacks are going to occur and that when they do, if they do, we are better prepared to deal with them. The killer, the man who took the lives of 49 people, demonstrated an act of hatred--in part, an act of terrorism but really an act of hatred. The question is, What do we do about it? Some would have us close our borders, the ability to come here even on a short-term basis: If you happen to be Muslim, we are going to keep you out. That is exactly what ISIS would like for us to do. There are 3.3 million Muslims in this country. The idea of somehow turning them against the rest of us, that is the kind of thing happening in some parts of Europe. Unlike Europe, we are a country where we accept the people who come to our shores. We accept them. When you were a stranger in my land, did you take me in? For us, for years, for decades, and for a couple of centuries, the answer has been yes. That doesn't mean we shouldn't very carefully check and test the backgrounds of the people who come here to make sure they are who they say they are, that they are not on a terrorist watch list. We have a bunch of those. We want to make sure our agencies and our terrorist watch lists are coordinated. We want to make sure our intelligence agencies are in close communication with one another. Part of the goal of ISIS is to make this a clash between the United States and the Muslim population here, 3.3 million people, and around the world. That is not what we should do. We should be smarter than that. One of the things we need to do is to continue the work that was begun from last year--I have said it often, I am going to say it again--to degrade and destroy those who would do us harm. Those who would do us enormous harm are trying to set up a caliphate. They are somehow using their religion, bastardizing their religion, and making it say things it doesn't even begin to say. What we need to do is make sure they get no further. The progress that has been made in terms of rolling them back was with the help of a coalition that includes 15 nations--16 nations. We are taking back a lot of the land and about to--I hope--take Fallujah and Mosul and continue there. When ISIS wannabes pop up in other countries, the idea is to work with our coalition in the countries that ISIS is trying to get a foothold in and make sure they are not successful. So it is a little like Whac-a-Mole--but it is not a game--and it is one we want to make sure they don't get a chance to get started there. If you look at the amount of money--ISIS used to make a lot of money selling oil. They take over oil refineries and oilfields, and they sell the oil on the black market. We have greatly diminished their ability to do that and greatly diminished their ability to make money. In some cases, we have figured out where they are keeping their cash stored, and we have gone in and destroyed literally hundreds of millions of dollars in their currency that they were harboring. There are a number of people coming from around the world to go to that part of the world--Iraq, Syria--who want to be ISIS volunteers. It is greatly diminished from what it was. It is down from 2,000 a month this time maybe last year to something that is just a fraction of that. In the United States not that long ago, early this year, maybe six people a month were going from the United States to the Middle East to be part of ISIS, and they are down to maybe one per month. It is still one too many, but we are headed in the right direction. The people who are being radicalized here by ISIS, ISIS is not sending people here to radicalize them. ISIS is basically trying to do this through social media, to use the Internet, and they are pretty good at it, but one of the things that will make them not so effective is once we demonstrate--and I think we are on our way to doing that-- that ISIS is a losing team. The people who are apparently claiming credit for it--or the killer in this case who killed all of our folks over the weekend, he was looking for a winning team. He is not a person who had a lot of wins in his life, and he wanted to be a part of a winning team. Our challenge is to make sure that anybody who is looking for a winning team or thinks they can, through radicalization, attacks, and terrorism--we need to make sure they know they are barking up the wrong tree. ISIS is a losing team. One of the ways we can do that is--the Presiding Officer along with me and a number of others on the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs have been all over this issue for years. It led to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. We continue to stay right on this issue, and we will probably be doing that for as long as any of us are in the Senate. [[Page S3818]] Part of what we should be doing, aside from degrading and destroying ISIS--if we are smart, one of the things we need to do is reach out to the Muslim community in this country, unlike what has happened in places in Europe, where you have a lot of Muslim folks who are all segregated. They are not part of the culture. They are not welcomed so much in those countries. One of the things about us in America is we are a melting pot. We have been a melting pot forever. When I was a stranger in your land, did you take me in? For years, we said the answer is yes. The Department of Homeland Security has asked for authorization to be able to create our community partnership, to reach out to Muslim communities across America, to meet with parents, with young people, not so young people, face the community, and make it clear they are a part of this country, make sure they say to their own people, their own young people: Don't do this. Don't do what this guy did over the weekend in Orlando. That is not part of our religion. It is not part of their religion. Don't go there. The third thing we can do and ought to be doing is to strengthen our defenses at home. We had an active shooter situation for hours into the wee hours of Saturday evening to Sunday morning, an active shooter situation. It is not the first active shooter situation we have faced. They are not easy to deal with. One of the things the Department of Homeland Security can do, is doing, and ought to be doing more of, if given the resources, is doing active shooter training in police agencies all over the United States. If they ever face a situation such as this, they know what to do and they are able to be effective and save lives. The other thing I would mention in terms of resources, as the Presiding Officer knows, we put a fair amount of resources toward a fusion center. Sometimes people used to call them confusion centers, but actually they are a fusion center. They give the ability to State and local law enforcement agencies to work with the Feds to better ensure that information gathered locally works its way up the channel, up through the chain of command, to be shared nationally with other States and with the Federal Government, and to make sure the converse is true, to the extent that we gather useful information at the national level, international level, that we bring it down and we funnel it back into individual States through fusion centers so they act on that actionable intelligence. We need to work with energy in this regard. We need to work with a sense of urgency. We need to make sure, as we go through the appropriations process in the Senate in the days and weeks ahead, that we are putting resources, financial resources, where they need to go. A number of folks have asked me in interviews yesterday and today: What should we be doing about gun control? How does all of this relate to gun control? The answer is, I am not sure how this is going to affect the way we view guns. I believe in the Second Amendment right. I am sure the Presiding Officer does, a former Army colonel, retired colonel. I am a retired Navy captain, a Vietnam veteran. My dad was a chief petty officer in World War II and served for a long time as a chief petty officer in the Reserves after that. My dad was a hunter. He came from a family of hunters and taught me to be a hunter and a fisherman. One of the proudest possessions I own is a shotgun my grandfather gave me before he died. When I was in the Navy, I used to go back on leave from Southeast Asia, go visit my parents near Clearwater, FL, and stay in a guest bedroom. In the guest bedroom, under my bed where I slept, were guns. I opened the closet in the guestroom for my clothes, and there were guns. My father, in addition to being a hunter, actually bought and sold guns. He would basically sell them to people he knew. He felt they were not people who were mentally unstable or people who were felons, but he believed in the Second Amendment right. My dad also believed in common sense. My dad is now deceased, but if he were alive and he heard that people who are on terrorism watch lists can literally buy weapons, including assault weapons, automatic weapons, he would say: That doesn't make any sense. If he found out we could go to a gun show, and a person who is mentally unstable, has a history of mental illness, and maybe someone who is a convicted felon could actually walk into a gun show and go to a federally registered gun dealer, be denied the ability to purchase an assault weapon, and then go to the next table over with someone who is not a federally registered gun dealer and purchase the same weapon they had just been denied, in terms of what makes sense and doesn't make sense to my dad and frankly to me--his son--those situations don't make a whole lot of sense. Those are areas we ought to agree on. One of our colleagues, as the Presiding Officer knows, Senator Enzi from Wyoming, likes to talk about the 80-20 rule. It is a great rule. It says there is about 80 percent of the stuff we agree on and maybe 20 percent of an issue we don't agree on. What we should do is focus on the 80 percent we agree on. My hope is--most Americans get it, in terms of making sure that folks who are on the terrorist watch list don't have access to buy weapons. They get it. I think they also get the idea that this gun show loophole is something that ought to be closed as well. I close by saying, in a sense, this is a test of our character as a nation. I said earlier our tradition has always been that we welcome people from disparate places, in some cases people fleeing oppression, lack of freedom, lack of religious opportunities and freedom of worship. That is the way we operate as a country. You don't open and read the Constitution--it doesn't say Matthew 25 because we decided we are not going to establish a religion here. If we did, Matthew 25 says: When I was hungry, did you feed me? When I was thirsty, did you give me to drink? When I was naked, did you clothe me? When I was a stranger in your land, did you take me in? I think we have a moral obligation to the least of these, including those who are fleeing oppression in other places looking for an opportunity for a new life. I think we have a moral obligation to welcome them, but we have a moral obligation to those who live here, to make sure that as we welcome people from other places, we do not imperil them by those who arrive from other shores. The last thing I would say is, we need the kind of leadership in this body that seeks to really do what it says right over the Presiding Officer's head, where the Presiding Officer is sitting. The Latin words--I don't know a lot of Latin words but ``e pluribus unum''--from many, one. Those are words that we would be wise to remember from this day as we go forward. I think that is pretty much what I wanted to say. As this week goes on, I ask that my colleagues and I find out as much as we can, learn as much as we can, find out what went right and what went wrong, and do more of what went right. And at the end of the day, let's make sure we are true to the values on which this country was built. I thank the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank our colleague for his words. I certainly join him in mourning the horrible, tragic loss of life this weekend in Orlando. Certainly I am committed, along with all our colleagues, to fighting terror wherever it exists and whomever it targets. This was absolutely horrible. Mr. President, I also rise today in support of a really important piece of bipartisan legislation that I have been working on with Senator Shaheen. I have introduced it to reauthorize the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Programs-- two vital small business programs in the Federal Government. We have an opportunity to accomplish this--to fully reauthorize and improve these programs--in the context of this Defense authorization bill that is on the floor now. I am very hopeful we are going to do that as part of a managers' package to the bill. These two programs--the Small Business Innovation Research and the Small Business Technology Transfer Programs--are really vital and useful to the success of small businesses directly responsible for creating thousands, tens of thousands of new jobs. By funding small businesses and entrepreneurs in the critical early stages [[Page S3819]] of R&D, these programs allow firms to drive the innovation sector of the economy with new ideas and technologies. Very rarely have government programs had such a clear and measurable, positive and stimulating effect on the economy. SBIR and STTR are also crucial to Federal agencies as they solve many of our biggest science and technology challenges. Giving small, innovative firms access to already appropriated Federal R&D funding is a win-win--a win for the small business sector and just as importantly a win for the taxpayer and those agencies. These programs exist to foster innovation, to facilitate public- private partnerships, to give firms the funding they need to help 11 Federal departments and agencies meet their R&D needs. These programs not only create jobs, but they also lead to a path for commercialization for many of these businesses, which is absolutely key to their success. These programs have been front and center in improving our Nation's capacity to innovate. Over the course of the SBIR Program history from 1982 to 2014--the last year for which we have numbers--Federal agencies have made more than 152,000 SBIR awards to small businesses to develop innovative technologies, and the total dollar amount awarded--again out of existing R&D budgets--is $42 billion. In 2014 alone, SBIR gave nearly 5,500 Phase I and Phase II awards worth about $2.2 billion, and the SBA is currently reporting an average of 5,000 awards per year. These awards are directly responsible for some of the most popular technologies that are available to the public today. For instance, through an SBIR award from the Air Force, we have created a technology known as LASIK, originally to correct vision for pilots, but that is a widely used technology to correct vision for all Americans. That was an SBIR success. Military armor has been a regular success of the SBIR Programs. ArmorWorks is a great example. That created over 350,000 top-of-the- line body armor plates worn by U.S. service men and women in the United States. Liftware Spoon--a spoon that stabilizes hand tremors for patients with Parkinson's disease and essential tremor--again is a clear, identifiable, and important SBIR success story. HydroMARK decreases patient discomfort with a minimally invasive breast biopsy procedure. With the HydroMARK, a mammogram is no longer necessary and the surgeon or radiologist can use an ultrasound to locate the tumor. This is a huge innovation that has dramatically improved thousands of women's lives and, again, directly out of SBIR. Bioseal reduces lung collapse rates after lung biopsies. iRobot's Roomba is something I can relate to. It is moving around at home when I am there on the weekend. This is the popular autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner that has reached major commercial success, selling over 10 million units. That is directly out of SBIR. These programs we are talking about, which have been so successful, are set to expire September 30 of 2017. As many of my colleagues can attest, it was a tumultuous process to complete the last reauthorization, so we are starting early now so we don't go through that tumultuous process again. Back then--the last reauthorization-- participating agencies and firms had to endure a process that took over 3 years and 14 short-term extensions. In a bipartisan effort with Senator Shaheen, we have been working for the last year to avoid all that and to do this ahead of time so we don't have all of that tumult and uncertainty, which saps the effectiveness of the program for a significant period of time. Reauthorizing these programs this year will ensure stability, foster an environment of innovative entrepreneurship, and avoid that uncertainty by directing more than $200 billion annually to this R&D funding to the Nation's small business firms. As chair of the Senate's Small Business Committee, I have made this a real priority. Senator Shaheen, as ranking member, has done the same. So I thank all of our committee members who are solidly behind this effort. I also thank so many other Members of the Senate who have been cooperative. In the context of this Defense bill, we have cleared our reauthorization amendment with the Senate Committee on Armed Services, and I want to specifically thank Senators McCain and Reed for their leadership. We have cleared it with the Commerce Committee because agencies under the jurisdiction of that committee are involved. We have cleared it with the HELP Committee. They have the same tangential relationship. We are the authorizing committee, but some agencies involved are under their jurisdiction. We have cleared it with everyone in sight, so that means we have a real opportunity to have this in the managers' package--which it is, as I speak--and to pass it through the Defense bill as a full reauthorization. I am also proud to share that not only will our reauthorization annually direct more than $2 billion of Federal R&D to small firms that are most likely to create jobs and commercialize their projects, but it will also establish the Regional SBIR State Collaborative Initiative Pilot Program to help low-participation States attract R&D funding for their businesses. All of this reauthorization is a true consensus effort, so I am grateful to the more than 50 organizations that strongly support it-- among them the Small Business Technology Council, the National Small Business Association and the Defense Alliance, and 47 more. It is a true consensus effort. They all support the effort, as does the leadership of SAS; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; and the Commerce Committee. So it is an important opportunity that we shouldn't let fall through our grasp. Again, I want to stress that reauthorizing this program is an effective way to meet national needs while jump-starting entrepreneurs, growing our economy, and creating jobs. With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this consensus amendment and help ensure that small businesses across the country can operate with long-term certainty and stability, which this amendment will provide. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mass Shooting in Orlando Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, the atrocity that occurred this past weekend in Orlando, FL, was an attack on every American, and my deepest condolences are with the victims and the families of this appalling attack. I am grateful for our law enforcement and the first responders who bravely put their lives on the line to save others. This attack--the deadliest in American history since 9/11--was carried out by a gunman who pledged allegiance to ISIS. There are 49 families who received phone calls this weekend--phone calls we all hope we never receive. There are 49 families who are arranging for funerals this week. They never dreamed they would be put in this position--the tragedy, the sorrow of the mothers, the fathers, the aunts, the uncles, the brothers, the sisters, the grandparents, the cousins, and friends who will all be attending funerals this week. Additionally, there are more than 50 families dealing with family members who were injured, some gravely, who are fighting for their lives as I speak. Montana is a long ways away from Orlando, but I can tell you that last night across our State there were vigils in Great Falls, Helena, Missoula, Bozeman, Butte, and Billings, MT. We stand united with Orlando. This threat of ISIS is continuing to grow each and every day. We need a strong strategy to destroy the growing threat of Islamic extremism-- Islamic extremism on our soil as well. President Obama, what is that strategy? We need to aggressively go after radical jihadists who seek to destroy our way of life and disturb the peace in our communities. The senseless hate of ISIS and radical Islam will not defeat us but, rather, strengthen our resolve and commitment to freedom. We need to remember that this was an act of terror on American soil, that this is a threat we face from radical Islam and ISIS, and that the worst response would be to politicize this and use this tragedy to restrict our constitutional rights and freedoms. We cannot allow dangerous terrorists to hide in our communities. We need to seek them out and ensure they aren't [[Page S3820]] able to inflict harm on our neighbors, our friends, and our families. May God comfort those who have been profoundly affected by this tragedy, and may God protect our men and women who are defending our country both here and abroad every day. We are a strong nation, and together we will protect our country and ensure victory over the terrorists who want to take away our very way of life here in America. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the junior Senator from Montana. I appreciate his coming to the floor today. I rise today with a heavy heart. Since I first heard the horrible news about the senseless act of terrorism in Orlando, the victims, the partners, and the families have been at the center of my thoughts and prayers. But thoughts and prayers are not enough. It is long past time for the Senate to come together and have a conversation about what steps need to be taken to put an end to this violence and hatred. We cannot continue to be crippled by inaction. The Senate needs to come together to strengthen our national security. After attacks like Orlando, we hear folks say ``Never again,'' but actions really do speak louder than words. It is time that we work together to try to prevent these senseless acts of terror and violence. That conversation begins with our national security and what needs to be done to keep our families and our communities safe. There are actions we can take right now to bolster our national security. There is no question that we must pass legislation that keeps guns out of the hands of terrorists. We absolutely do need to secure our borders. And we need to continue to crack down on insider threats by reforming our security clearance process. Intolerance and hate have no place in this country, and as elected leaders, we have a responsibility to ensure that every American can live their life each day free from fear. Veterans First Act Mr. President, this Nation has made a sacred promise to the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. These folks answered a call to duty, and they made selfless sacrifices to protect the freedoms we all enjoy. These heroes stood up for us, and now it is time for the Senate to stand up for them. Two years ago, when reports surfaced that veterans were dying while waiting to receive care at the VA, the Senate acted swiftly, and we passed legislation to build the capacity of the VA to better meet the needs of veterans now and into the future. Also included in that bill was the Veterans Choice Program, which allowed more veterans to seek care in their own community when they were unable to get timely care from the VA. Unfortunately, the Choice Program is broken. We have heard this from veterans and community leaders, from veteran service organizations, from Republicans and from Democrats. The intent of the Choice Program was a good one--to get veterans care more quickly--but the rollout has been disastrous, causing far too many veterans to wait even longer for an appointment. But because of the leadership of Chairman Isakson and Ranking Member Blumenthal, the Veterans' Affairs Committee came together in May and approved the Veterans First Act, which includes provisions that I and Senator Burr authored to fix the Choice Program. It also includes critical provisions to hold the VA accountable, increase veterans access to care both inside and outside the VA, and better deliver on the commitment this Nation has made to the folks who have served. Since this bill was unanimously passed out of committee back on May 16, it has fallen victim to politics as usual, and a combination of anonymous holds and the majority leader's decision not to bring it to the floor have put this bipartisan piece of legislation, this good piece of legislation for our veterans, in limbo. And now there are only 21 days left until the Senate is set to recess for nearly 2 months. I am concerned that the clock is running out and that this bipartisan bill will fall victim to the Senate's inaction. We cannot let business as usual here in Washington, DC, derail critically needed reforms. Veterans will not and should not accept excuses for the Senate not acting. This is a good bill. It is a bill that gives the VA the flexibility to work directly with community providers to connect veterans to the care they need so that the VA does not need to work through a middleman. This bill also provides the budget flexibility necessary to ensure veterans are routed to care in a manner that makes the most sense for them. It imposes stricter rules to ensure the VA is reimbursing community providers in a more timely manner. It also includes critical provisions that I helped author to ensure the VA is able to more quickly fill leadership vacancies at VA medical facilities. That is why today I am calling on the Senate to put politics aside, put personal agendas aside, and get this bill to the floor for debate and for an up-or-down vote. The millions of veterans who are still being forced to wait more than 30 days to schedule an appointment deserve that vote. The veterans who are still kept on long wait lists deserve that vote. And the folks who have sacrificed so much to protect and defend this country deserve that vote. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mass Shooting in Orlando Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, early in the morning this past Sunday, the worst mass shooting in America's history took place. Forty-nine people were killed and 53 more wounded at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL. We don't know all the details, but we know that this was an act of terror and that it was an act of hate directed at the LGBT community. I want to begin by expressing my condolences to the victims, to their families and loved ones, and to the city of Orlando. I thank the first responders who ran toward the sound of gunfire, who literally risked their lives to save the lives of others. I express my support and solidarity with the LGBT community in Orlando and throughout the Nation. Many of the patrons at the Pulse nightclub were members of that community. They were simply enjoying a fun night out at an establishment that welcomed them. June is Pride Month. It is a month where we should take pride in the advances we have made toward equality since Stonewall in 1969. The LGBT movement has come a long way in protecting Americans' right to love the person they love. Yet this weekend's shooting is a sobering reminder that this community still remains a target of vicious hatred. As we mourn those we lost in Orlando, we must not lose our pride in what the LGBT movement has accomplished. We must stand in solidarity with our fellow LGBT Americans who will not let the hate of a few overcome the love of an entire community. The shooter who perpetrated this horrific attack has been identified as a 29-year-old U.S. citizen who was living in St. Lucie County, FL. The shooter reportedly entered the nightclub at about 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and a handgun. He opened fire on the patrons and engaged in a shoot-out with an off-duty Orlando police officer who was working security at the nightclub. The shooter apparently held a number of hostages in the nightclub for several hours, until a SWAT team swarmed the building, killing the gunman at about 5 a.m. Reportedly, the shooter called 911 to pledge allegiance to ISIS, even while the attack was under way. We do not yet know when and how this gunman may have been radicalized. Reportedly, he had been the subject of at least two FBI investigations in recent years regarding possible ties to terrorist groups. The shooter reportedly bought the two guns he used on Sunday within the last several days. He was able to buy these guns legally, despite the past [[Page S3821]] investigations into his potential terrorist ties. Let's be clear. In America, our laws currently allow dangerous people to buy guns. That has to change. I respect the Second Amendment to our Constitution. That amendment protects the responsible use of guns for lawful purposes. But the Supreme Court has made it clear that it is constitutional to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Our lawmakers are simply not doing enough to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Right now, the FBI cannot stop a known or suspected terrorist from walking into a gunshop and walking out with an AR-15, an assault weapon. The GAO found that between 2004 and 2014, suspected terrorists bought guns lawfully at least 2,043 times from American gun dealers. What are we thinking? Last December, when the Senate took up this measure, we failed on the floor of the Senate to pass legislation to close this terror gap loophole. The gap remains open, and we have failed to close the gaping loopholes in our own background check system that allow terrorists, criminals, and others to get guns without a background check from gun shows or over the Internet. Why do we make it so easy for people that we suspect of being involved in terrorism to buy guns--assault weapons, military-style guns? Last December, this Senate failed again to pass Manchin-Toomey, a bill that would close many of these loopholes. This was a bipartisan bill, yet we couldn't pass it on the floor of the Senate. We know our weak gun laws make us vulnerable, but we have not acted to strengthen them. In fact, almost every week we see efforts in Congress to further weaken gun laws in America. Hundreds of men, women, and children are shot every day in America, and on average 91 of those victims die. It is an epidemic of gun violence that has devastated families and communities in every State. No community has been hit harder than the city of Chicago--the city I am honored to represent and the city I love and a city where this past weekend, 44 people were shot, 7 of them fatally. More than 1,650 people have been shot so far this year in Chicago, with at least 282 victims dying from their wounds. The tragedy of Orlando is that it all happened in a few hours. The tragedy of gun violence in Chicago is that it happens almost every day. Across the Nation, we have seen Americans gunned down in nightclubs, elementary schools, churches, temples, movie theaters, health care clinics, malls, colleges, and our homes and our neighborhoods. We need to wake up and act to reduce this violence. Thoughts and prayers are important but not sufficient. We need votes and laws to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Can't we agree on that? The responsibility lies right here. We have that responsibility and that opportunity. This weekend's act of hate and terror in Orlando has been condemned by Americans of all backgrounds and all faiths, and Orlando has received an extraordinary outpouring of support and solidarity from all across the United States and around the world. We do stand united against ISIS and its efforts to promote mass shootings and acts of terror. We stand in support of the LGBT community--the latest target of this terrorist attack. This solidarity is important. Our efforts to defeat ISIS and keep America safe from hate and terror are strengthened when our Nation and the world stand united. We must not let the actions of a hateful few divide us and prevent us from working together to combat this evil. We also must not let this act of hate and terror lead to hostility against the Muslim community in America. The American Muslim community has stood with all Americans in condemning Sunday's mass shooting. American Muslim leaders immediately spoke out and condemned the attack. Muslim Floridians donated blood and money to help the victims and survivors. In the coming days, there will be those who say we should respond to this attack by discriminating against innocent American Muslims and immigrants. But the solution to hate is not more hate; it is unity. In Orlando, they understand this. In a news conference after the shooting, a representative of Equality Florida recognized the unity between the LGBT and Muslim communities, stating that his organization ``stands in solidarity with the Muslim and Islamic community in opposition to the intolerance, discrimination, and hate crimes that both of our communities experience.'' That was a statement by the representative of Equality Florida about Muslims in Florida itself. It is unfortunate that the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, Donald Trump, does not understand this. In response to the Orlando attack, Mr. Trump wasted no time calling again for a ban on all Muslims immigrating to the United States. General Michael Hayden is no softy, no liberal. He was Director of the CIA, and the National Security Agency under President George W. Bush. Here is what General Hayden said of Mr. Trump's response to the attack: ``Prejudiced, simplistic, and frankly inaccurate.'' General Hayden has pointed out that banning all Muslim immigration would not make us safer and actually helps ISIS recruit those who hate the United States. As we mourn those we have lost, we must also roll up our sleeves and get to work. We must pursue smart, commonsense reforms to keep dangerous, hateful people from getting their hands on dangerous weapons. America just suffered its deadliest mass shooting event in history--worse than San Bernardino, worse than Newtown, worse than Virginia Tech. If there was ever a time for Congress to do its job and keep guns out of dangerous hands, this is it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first and foremost, I wish to send my heartfelt sympathy to those who have lost loved ones in Orlando, FL, in Orange County, yesterday in a tragic event. I want to express my great appreciation to the people of Orlando who volunteered their blood, their families, and their houses to help support those victims; to the EMTs who rushed into harm's way to save lives--and they did save lives--and to the hospital trauma team that did an amazing job of responding instantaneously to a tragedy beyond anybody's comprehension. We are very sad in America today by the terrible attack that took place and those who would perpetrate it. I, for one, am going to roll up my sleeves and work to see to it that wherever radical Islamic terrorism is, I want to root it out and I want to destroy it. You cannot accept or tolerate what happened yesterday, and we must redouble our effort to follow it wherever it leads us and to wipe it out and to eradicate it. I, as one Senator, will promise to do that. Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations Bill Mr. President, I am one of those guys who usually is very supportive of going to cloture and going on motions to proceed on just about anything because I think the Senate is the most deliberative body in the world and we ought to do that. But tomorrow, shortly after 11 o'clock, I am going to vote no on the motion to proceed to the Commerce-Justice-Science bill. I want to memorialize why on the floor of the Senate tonight so everybody is clear and understands. There is report language in the Commerce-Justice-Science portion of the appropriations bill that directly interjects this Congress, this Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives into a tristate water compact misunderstanding among the States of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida that has gone on for 27 years. I know that is of no interest to the Presiding Officer from Indiana, nor to the Senator who just preceded me from Chicago, IL, nor anybody else, but what is of interest to you would be any time that Congress decided to interject its nose in your business. Tomorrow, if the motion to proceed brings it to the floor, it will be injecting 100 Senators into an issue among 6 Senators. That is not the right way to do it. In fact, the tristate water compact, which has been off and on in negotiations for 26 years, [[Page S3822]] is at its closest point of being finally decided in a court of law. The judge and the special master recently notified us that they will hear the final case on the tristate water compact in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida this November. So the issue is going to be resolved. We have no place as a Senate or as a Congress to inject ourselves into a case that is pending litigation in the courts between States on issues that are purely theirs--except for the fact that over the years, for nefarious reasons and unpleasant reasons, sometimes Congress has from time to time thwarted water control manuals, thwarted the authority of the Corps of Engineers from doing its job, all over litigation of the ACF and AC basins in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama. I want to bring a resolution. I want all the States to have an adequate supply of water. I want us to be cooperative and work together, and I want us to do it the right way. The right way is to not interject ourselves at the last minute in an appropriations bill with nefarious language that can't be touched that is in the report language but, instead, to pull that language out, as I will try to do with an amendment on the floor. If I am unsuccessful, I will try to do an amendment that counteracts that language, to see to it that Congress does not stick its nose in a place that it does not belong. I like to be cooperative. I like to move forward. I don't want to slow down progress. But I was sent here to represent 10.4 million people in the State of Georgia and, by golly, I am going to do it. If somebody is trying to inject themselves beyond the appropriate place, I am going to do everything I can to stop them. The way I will start that tomorrow will be to vote no on the motion to proceed to go to the Commerce-Justice-Science bill. I yield back my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mass Shooting in Orlando Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the horror of Orlando, and I know so many Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle have been thinking about those who lost their lives and talking about this horror that once again has impacted everyone from one end of America to the other. I won't speak for a long time tonight other than to say--which I think is plainly evident from the evidence we have right now at this point in the investigation--that this was first an act of terror and it was also an act of hate. I think both are significant because of the impact they have on our country over time. I think there is a strong belief that the first thing we must do is to express not just condolence but solidarity with the people of Orlando, the people of Florida, and to do what we can to help them and help those communities and families who lost so much in such a short timeframe. At last count, there are 50 dead and more than 50 injured. There will be some who say that beyond that, there is not much we can do, that we should just stay where we are now and not change the laws. I don't agree with that, and I won't dwell on a long list tonight, but I hope at some point we can begin to reengage on a number of issues and at least have a full debate and also a series of votes on a couple of measures which I think are common sense. These are issues that we voted on I believe most recently in 2013, and I was hoping we would vote on them after that. One of the votes had to do with a ban on military-style weapons. I think it would be appropriate to at least debate and vote on it. I would vote in favor of it, and some would not. We should certainly have a vote on the size of the clips, or the magazines. To put it plainly, how many bullets should one person have in their possession or as part of the weapon at any one time? Should someone be allowed to go into any kind of establishment and start shooting, thereby releasing rounds and rounds of ammunition and hundreds and hundreds of bullets? Should that be permitted to anyone at any time or anywhere? I don't think so. If someone is on the terror watch list and that person has been deemed so dangerous that we have labeled him or her as a terrorist or potential terrorist and he or she can't get on an airplane, certainly that person should not have a weapon. That seems to make sense. If they are too dangerous to get on a plane because of their tendency to commit acts of violence or engage in terror, they shouldn't be able to have a firearm. I think it would make sense to have a debate and vote on that issue. Another issue is background checks. That was one measure where there was a lot of consensus or substantial bipartisan support, but it didn't pass in 2013. I hope we can have another vote on that. If a person is not able to get through a background check due to a whole variety of reasons, such as having a criminal record or otherwise, you have to ask yourself, should someone with a criminal record have access to a firearm? Mr. President, today I have introduced the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, S. 3053. That is a new proposal to do what some States have done already. I think it is essential to add this to the other pieces of legislation that have been talked about and some that I just itemized. This bill, first of all, would define what a misdemeanor hate crime is because the intent of the bill is to say: If you are convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime, you shouldn't have access to a firearm. This category of misdemeanors would be under Federal, State, or tribal law that are found to be motivated, at least in part, by hate or bias against the victim's race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. In essence, these eight categories are what some would call, to use the more legal jargon, the protected classes. That is how we would define a misdemeanor hate crime. This bill, upon passage, would keep firearms out of the hands of those convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes. It would prohibit the purchase, possession, or shipment of a firearm by anyone convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime. That is the basics of the bill. Obviously it doesn't have direct application to what happened in Orlando; however, upon further investigation, we may find that it does. Part of the reason for this is because there has been a rise not only in hate crimes but in hate groups across the country, with hundreds more in just the last couple of years, and literally thousands more, if not more, hate crimes have been committed. Those issues I mentioned are among the many things we need to address. I also think that in addition to taking these steps on commonsense gun measures, we have to make sure law enforcement has the resources it needs to take on the challenge of not just criminal activity but increasingly almost terroristic activity within our communities--the so-called lone wolf terrorist, the homegrown terrorist, the individual who is self-radicalized, which seems to be part of the horror of Orlando. We have to make sure that if law enforcement professionals tell us they need more money in the COPS Program, we should appropriate more money. If the law enforcement professionals say: Please fund that program that has worked for so many years, such as the Byrne Justice assistance grants, we should make sure they have those appropriations. If you are tough on law enforcement-- that is nice to say, but it is better to prove it by how you vote. Finally, of course, we have to continue to focus on what is a major component, of course, of Orlando and San Bernardino and so many other places, and that is violent extremism in communities across the country. We have to make sure we are working with local law enforcement and Federal authorities not only to give them the resources they need but to be able to coordinate and do our best to unearth plots before they transpire and to be able to take this fight directly to a terrorist, many of whom are in our midst here in the United States. [[Page S3823]] We have a lot to do. It is not simply a question of what we do on a series of commonsense gun measures, it is also a question of what we are going to do to help our law enforcement and to work as hard as we can in a bipartisan way to debate and vote on measures that will keep our country safe and protect our homeland. Unfortunately, we are seeing more and more of a rise in these individuals who are, as I mentioned before, self-radicalized and sometimes categorized as a lone wolf. We have to make sure we are doing everything possible to identify them, apprehend them, and make sure we are thwarting these plots ahead of time. It may not work in every instance, but we have to take every measure possible. I think part of that is doing what I hope we can do as a matter of preventive steps. If someone is engaging in hate and taking action against others, even if it only rises to the level of a misdemeanor, they shouldn't have access to a firearm. We want to nip this in the bud, stop it long before that hate continues and develops into the kind of hate that leads to a much greater and more lethal attack on Americans. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_183.csv,61496,61496,61562,"[congressional record volume 162, number 93 (monday, june 13, 2016)] [senate] [pages s3815-s3823] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 the acting president pro tempore. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of s. 2943, which the clerk will report. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: a bill (s. 2943) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the department of defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the department of energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. pending: mccain amendment no. 4607, to amend the provision on share- in-savings contracts. reed (for reid) amendment no. 4603 (to amendment no.4607), to change the enactment date. the acting president pro tempore. the senator from florida. mass shooting in orlando mr. nelson. madam president, i have just returned from the command center of the emergency operations center, a temporary one that has been set up in the middle of south orange avenue, very close to the pulse nightclub, not far from the hospital where so many of the victims have been taken, where 9 of the victims died in the care of the doctors, and where there are up to 50 people, some of whom are still fighting for their lives. needless to say, orlando is shocked. we didn't know a place that sometimes [[page s3816]] is called the happiest place on earth could be one of the saddest places on earth. indeed, the morning's orlando sentinel, the entire front page is dedicated to a statement by the paper entitled ``our community will heal.'' will our community heal? well, certainly, in what we see with the long lines snaking around the block at the blood donation center, where it is literally going around what would be the length of 2 blocks, and where there are people standing in the hot sun with umbrellas to donate blood, that says something about how the community will heal. indeed, when we had our office in orlando opened on sunday, the kinds of calls expressing grief and shock and just disbelief, along with the messages of comfort, has been quite a contrast to the 95 percent of the hundreds and hundreds of calls the orlando office has received today. ninety-five percent of those calls have been hateful. what does that say about us as a nation? will we, in fact, heal? what does it say about us as a nation deep inside? have we lost the teachings in almost all the major religions--clearly in the holy scriptures of the old testament and clearly in the new testament, as well as in the koran. you will recognize these words if i say it in the old english: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. putting it in modern english, it means to treat others as you would want to be treated. yet what we find is that in our society today there are folks who want to divide instead of unify, and this killer is a good example. i have spent two days with the fbi. i have been on the phone. i have talked to the secretary of homeland security. i have talked to our intelligence community. it is this senator's opinion that once the dots are completely connected--and they are being rapidly connected. the fbi is doing a great job. they are the lead in orlando. by the way, talking about something good, what about the cooperation and coordination, which has been almost seamless, among local, state, and federal government officials, all represented down there in the command center, all being represented as a number of us went in front of the assembled cameras? it seems that is a good thing. that is unity. that is how we do things in america. yet, as the dots are being connected, we will find out that, yes, this shooter was isis-inspired--and that is a whole set of issues--and how are we going to protect ourselves in the future? but we are also going to find that this shooter was inspired by hatred, and we are going to find that this hatred was directed, as his father already said in interviews, toward the gay community. so here again, we have another terrible tragedy. i have had a number of calls from my fellow senators. one of those calls came from richard blumenthal. he is from connecticut. he has reason to be sensitive about this because of the sandy hook elementary school shooting, where 20 children and some 6 adults were gunned down needlessly. maybe that was a mental case. maybe part of this one in orlando is a mental case. but it is driven by hatred, maybe through isis, a hatred of america and of a free society being willing to be able to speak what you want without fear of persecution, or maybe it is a hatred about a group of people. it is exactly the opposite of what is taught in all of the scriptures. so as we heal in orlando, it will take a while. you can imagine those families of the ones who have been lost. you can imagine the families down in the orlando health hospital right now, grieving, hoping, and praying that those victims fighting for their lives are going to make it. so america, we are going to have to dig down deep and find out who we really are. you know, i really know who we are. we are a people with a character that is compassionate, generous, kind, and respectful. we as americans are ladies and gentlemen. we can express ourselves as has been the tradition on the floor of this senate in the heat of political debate. we can sharply differ, but we can be respectful of the other fellow's point of view. that is america, and until we finally come to the conclusion and insist that this aberrant behavior be stopped--until that happens--we will still be grieving. i yield the floor. the acting president pro tempore. the senator from massachusetts. mr. markey. thank you, madam president. i rise to echo the sentiments of the senator from florida. his state has suffered an unspeakable tragedy. it is something that unfortunately brings together two terrible biases--one against the lgbt community and the other a religiously based radical attack inspired by isis at that nightclub. they all came together. to the senator and to everyone from florida, our deepest, deepest sympathies go to you. it was, of course, something that was understood in massachusetts. he mentioned the tsarnaev brothers as an inspiration to him. they struck on patriots day in 2013 in the united states. mohamed atta and the other nine hijackers were in boston when they hijacked the two planes from logan international airport. so we know those people are out there. we know that their hate-filled message is intended to kill innocent americans, and we saw it once again. unfortunately, the target was a gay nightclub in orlando, florida. but for us, i think we have to learn from this. this man had been investigated as a terrorist suspect, and yet we are blocked--the senator from florida and i and others--from passing a law that would prevent anyone on a terror watch list from buying a gun in these united states. it is not against the law. the national rifle association has enough power here on the floor of the senate to prohibit someone who is on a terror watch list from buying guns in the united states of america. we need another vote on that issue here in the senate. we need to give the protections to the american people for them to know that someone on a terror watch list cannot buy a gun in the united states of america. we also have to ban these military-style assault weapons, like the ar-15, which are the guns of choice for those who seek to inflict mass casualties on civilians. these are not weapons that belong on the streets of our country. they belong in combat overseas, not in our communities. they don't belong in newtown, they don't belong in san bernardino, and they don't belong in orlando. they don't belong in our streets or in our schools or in a civilized society, yet we cannot ban these weapons from being sold in the united states of america. we have to prevent any known or suspected terrorist from buying firearms, and we have to make it impossible, as well, for them to buy these assault weapons. this is our challenge now. once again, we are warned. once again, we are told what the weapon of choice is. once again, we know that they are going to target us if we make it easy for them to access these weapons. how many warnings do we need? the nra really should stand for ``not relevant anymore'' in american politics. they should not control the agenda here on the floor of the senate. we should be able to ban people on the terror watch list from buying guns. we should be able to ban these assault weapons from being sold at all inside of our country. the senate leadership should stop banning a vote here on the senate floor on ensuring that we do the research at the cdc on this relationship between mental health and the use of guns within our society. the bill that i have introduced calls for $10 million a year for the next 6 years. we can't even get the money to research gun violence in the united states of america. it doesn't have to be this way. we can change. we can learn these lessons, but we can't wait any longer to put those commonsense gun laws on the books. we cannot wait any longer to make our streets safer. so let's close the gun show loophole that allows anyone to go into one of these kmarts full of killing machines and buy a gun without a background check. let's close the loophole that allows domestic abusers to buy guns. let's close the loophole that allows straw purchasers to buy guns and flood our streets with them. let's repeal the protection of lawful commerce in arms act and take away the gun manufacturers' immunity from civil liability. plcaa should stand for ``protecting lives, creating arms accountability,'' not protecting these arms manufacturers from liability if these guns are used to kill innocent people in our society. [[page s3817]] so in the coming days and weeks, you can be assured that the national rifle association will be opposed to even these limited commonsense gun measures. the nra has had a stranglehold over congress for far too long. it is time to end its reign of power. it is time to end its viselike grip on the safety and security of our nation. those in congress who do not support these commonsense measures are siding with those forces that make it easier for these massacres to happen. that is the bottom line of where we are. now is the time to stand up for the families of columbine, of newtown, of aurora, of chattanooga, of charleston, of san bernardino, and now of orlando, and of all of the cities across our country, which are saying: enough is enough. i was so proud on saturday to march in the boston gay pride parade. it was a joyous occasion where love, community, and social justice were all celebrated with a passion and a real sense of progress. but as i woke up the next morning, i saw again how an individual armed with guns and fueled by extremist ideology can fuel violence and terror. we are a nation of hope, not hatred. after this tragedy, after this deplorable attack, let's denounce hate in all of its forms. let's stand with the lgbt community and raise our voices with dignity, equality, and love. let's say no to the rhetoric of hate that demonizes our friends and neighbors because of their faith, sexual orientation, or because of their country of origin. let's recommit to justice and moving progress forward. the american people are begging, pleading for this institution to enact commonsense gun safety measures. my hope is that the senate can succeed where it has recently failed and muster the political will and courage to deliver badly needed reform of our gun laws. let's work together to do this and to help prevent yet another mass shooting in our country. i yield back. the acting president pro tempore. the senator from delaware. mr. carper. madam president, it is good to see the presiding officer this afternoon. this past weekend, saturday, my wife and i went to new york city at the invitation of one of our sons. we visited the 9/11 memorial in new york, literally erected on the site of the world trade center. i must confess it was emotionally charging, very saddening, and at the same time uplifting and inspiring. i never imagined that within the space of less than 24 hours we would see dozens of our young have their lives taken from them. i remember walking through the 9/11 memorial--and for those who have not been, i urge you to go. for those who have, you probably remember going through parts of the memorial and literally seeing the faces of 3,000 men, women, and some children whose lives were snuffed out that day some 15 years ago. every one of them had moms and dads. they had grandparents. a number of them had children, spouses, brothers, sisters, cousins, nephews, and nieces. those families struggle even today with their loss. the young people who died saturday night, sunday morning in a nightclub in orlando, like those many folks whose faces we saw on saturday, also have moms and dads, grandmoms, granddads, brothers, sisters, and cousins. their families are mourning today just like others did 15 years ago. what i want to do is preface my remarks by reaching out across the miles to the families who are mourning, trying to deal with their losses, and let them know that we want to take you in our loving embrace. to the best of our ability, we also want to make sure we continue to take steps in this country to ensure we reduce the likelihood that these kinds of attacks are going to occur and that when they do, if they do, we are better prepared to deal with them. the killer, the man who took the lives of 49 people, demonstrated an act of hatred--in part, an act of terrorism but really an act of hatred. the question is, what do we do about it? some would have us close our borders, the ability to come here even on a short-term basis: if you happen to be muslim, we are going to keep you out. that is exactly what isis would like for us to do. there are 3.3 million muslims in this country. the idea of somehow turning them against the rest of us, that is the kind of thing happening in some parts of europe. unlike europe, we are a country where we accept the people who come to our shores. we accept them. when you were a stranger in my land, did you take me in? for us, for years, for decades, and for a couple of centuries, the answer has been yes. that doesn't mean we shouldn't very carefully check and test the backgrounds of the people who come here to make sure they are who they say they are, that they are not on a terrorist watch list. we have a bunch of those. we want to make sure our agencies and our terrorist watch lists are coordinated. we want to make sure our intelligence agencies are in close communication with one another. part of the goal of isis is to make this a clash between the united states and the muslim population here, 3.3 million people, and around the world. that is not what we should do. we should be smarter than that. one of the things we need to do is to continue the work that was begun from last year--i have said it often, i am going to say it again--to degrade and destroy those who would do us harm. those who would do us enormous harm are trying to set up a caliphate. they are somehow using their religion, bastardizing their religion, and making it say things it doesn't even begin to say. what we need to do is make sure they get no further. the progress that has been made in terms of rolling them back was with the help of a coalition that includes 15 nations--16 nations. we are taking back a lot of the land and about to--i hope--take fallujah and mosul and continue there. when isis wannabes pop up in other countries, the idea is to work with our coalition in the countries that isis is trying to get a foothold in and make sure they are not successful. so it is a little like whac-a-mole--but it is not a game--and it is one we want to make sure they don't get a chance to get started there. if you look at the amount of money--isis used to make a lot of money selling oil. they take over oil refineries and oilfields, and they sell the oil on the black market. we have greatly diminished their ability to do that and greatly diminished their ability to make money. in some cases, we have figured out where they are keeping their cash stored, and we have gone in and destroyed literally hundreds of millions of dollars in their currency that they were harboring. there are a number of people coming from around the world to go to that part of the world--iraq, syria--who want to be isis volunteers. it is greatly diminished from what it was. it is down from 2,000 a month this time maybe last year to something that is just a fraction of that. in the united states not that long ago, early this year, maybe six people a month were going from the united states to the middle east to be part of isis, and they are down to maybe one per month. it is still one too many, but we are headed in the right direction. the people who are being radicalized here by isis, isis is not sending people here to radicalize them. isis is basically trying to do this through social media, to use the internet, and they are pretty good at it, but one of the things that will make them not so effective is once we demonstrate--and i think we are on our way to doing that-- that isis is a losing team. the people who are apparently claiming credit for it--or the killer in this case who killed all of our folks over the weekend, he was looking for a winning team. he is not a person who had a lot of wins in his life, and he wanted to be a part of a winning team. our challenge is to make sure that anybody who is looking for a winning team or thinks they can, through radicalization, attacks, and terrorism--we need to make sure they know they are barking up the wrong tree. isis is a losing team. one of the ways we can do that is--the presiding officer along with me and a number of others on the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs have been all over this issue for years. it led to the creation of the department of homeland security. we continue to stay right on this issue, and we will probably be doing that for as long as any of us are in the senate. [[page s3818]] part of what we should be doing, aside from degrading and destroying isis--if we are smart, one of the things we need to do is reach out to the muslim community in this country, unlike what has happened in places in europe, where you have a lot of muslim folks who are all segregated. they are not part of the culture. they are not welcomed so much in those countries. one of the things about us in america is we are a melting pot. we have been a melting pot forever. when i was a stranger in your land, did you take me in? for years, we said the answer is yes. the department of homeland security has asked for authorization to be able to create our community partnership, to reach out to muslim communities across america, to meet with parents, with young people, not so young people, face the community, and make it clear they are a part of this country, make sure they say to their own people, their own young people: don't do this. don't do what this guy did over the weekend in orlando. that is not part of our religion. it is not part of their religion. don't go there. the third thing we can do and ought to be doing is to strengthen our defenses at home. we had an active shooter situation for hours into the wee hours of saturday evening to sunday morning, an active shooter situation. it is not the first active shooter situation we have faced. they are not easy to deal with. one of the things the department of homeland security can do, is doing, and ought to be doing more of, if given the resources, is doing active shooter training in police agencies all over the united states. if they ever face a situation such as this, they know what to do and they are able to be effective and save lives. the other thing i would mention in terms of resources, as the presiding officer knows, we put a fair amount of resources toward a fusion center. sometimes people used to call them confusion centers, but actually they are a fusion center. they give the ability to state and local law enforcement agencies to work with the feds to better ensure that information gathered locally works its way up the channel, up through the chain of command, to be shared nationally with other states and with the federal government, and to make sure the converse is true, to the extent that we gather useful information at the national level, international level, that we bring it down and we funnel it back into individual states through fusion centers so they act on that actionable intelligence. we need to work with energy in this regard. we need to work with a sense of urgency. we need to make sure, as we go through the appropriations process in the senate in the days and weeks ahead, that we are putting resources, financial resources, where they need to go. a number of folks have asked me in interviews yesterday and today: what should we be doing about gun control? how does all of this relate to gun control? the answer is, i am not sure how this is going to affect the way we view guns. i believe in the second amendment right. i am sure the presiding officer does, a former army colonel, retired colonel. i am a retired navy captain, a vietnam veteran. my dad was a chief petty officer in world war ii and served for a long time as a chief petty officer in the reserves after that. my dad was a hunter. he came from a family of hunters and taught me to be a hunter and a fisherman. one of the proudest possessions i own is a shotgun my grandfather gave me before he died. when i was in the navy, i used to go back on leave from southeast asia, go visit my parents near clearwater, fl, and stay in a guest bedroom. in the guest bedroom, under my bed where i slept, were guns. i opened the closet in the guestroom for my clothes, and there were guns. my father, in addition to being a hunter, actually bought and sold guns. he would basically sell them to people he knew. he felt they were not people who were mentally unstable or people who were felons, but he believed in the second amendment right. my dad also believed in common sense. my dad is now deceased, but if he were alive and he heard that people who are on terrorism watch lists can literally buy weapons, including assault weapons, automatic weapons, he would say: that doesn't make any sense. if he found out we could go to a gun show, and a person who is mentally unstable, has a history of mental illness, and maybe someone who is a convicted felon could actually walk into a gun show and go to a federally registered gun dealer, be denied the ability to purchase an assault weapon, and then go to the next table over with someone who is not a federally registered gun dealer and purchase the same weapon they had just been denied, in terms of what makes sense and doesn't make sense to my dad and frankly to me--his son--those situations don't make a whole lot of sense. those are areas we ought to agree on. one of our colleagues, as the presiding officer knows, senator enzi from wyoming, likes to talk about the 80-20 rule. it is a great rule. it says there is about 80 percent of the stuff we agree on and maybe 20 percent of an issue we don't agree on. what we should do is focus on the 80 percent we agree on. my hope is--most americans get it, in terms of making sure that folks who are on the terrorist watch list don't have access to buy weapons. they get it. i think they also get the idea that this gun show loophole is something that ought to be closed as well. i close by saying, in a sense, this is a test of our character as a nation. i said earlier our tradition has always been that we welcome people from disparate places, in some cases people fleeing oppression, lack of freedom, lack of religious opportunities and freedom of worship. that is the way we operate as a country. you don't open and read the constitution--it doesn't say matthew 25 because we decided we are not going to establish a religion here. if we did, matthew 25 says: when i was hungry, did you feed me? when i was thirsty, did you give me to drink? when i was naked, did you clothe me? when i was a stranger in your land, did you take me in? i think we have a moral obligation to the least of these, including those who are fleeing oppression in other places looking for an opportunity for a new life. i think we have a moral obligation to welcome them, but we have a moral obligation to those who live here, to make sure that as we welcome people from other places, we do not imperil them by those who arrive from other shores. the last thing i would say is, we need the kind of leadership in this body that seeks to really do what it says right over the presiding officer's head, where the presiding officer is sitting. the latin words--i don't know a lot of latin words but ``e pluribus unum''--from many, one. those are words that we would be wise to remember from this day as we go forward. i think that is pretty much what i wanted to say. as this week goes on, i ask that my colleagues and i find out as much as we can, learn as much as we can, find out what went right and what went wrong, and do more of what went right. and at the end of the day, let's make sure we are true to the values on which this country was built. i thank the chair. the presiding officer (mr. coats). the senator from louisiana. mr. vitter. mr. president, first of all, let me thank our colleague for his words. i certainly join him in mourning the horrible, tragic loss of life this weekend in orlando. certainly i am committed, along with all our colleagues, to fighting terror wherever it exists and whomever it targets. this was absolutely horrible. mr. president, i also rise today in support of a really important piece of bipartisan legislation that i have been working on with senator shaheen. i have introduced it to reauthorize the small business innovation research and small business technology transfer programs-- two vital small business programs in the federal government. we have an opportunity to accomplish this--to fully reauthorize and improve these programs--in the context of this defense authorization bill that is on the floor now. i am very hopeful we are going to do that as part of a managers' package to the bill. these two programs--the small business innovation research and the small business technology transfer programs--are really vital and useful to the success of small businesses directly responsible for creating thousands, tens of thousands of new jobs. by funding small businesses and entrepreneurs in the critical early stages [[page s3819]] of r&d, these programs allow firms to drive the innovation sector of the economy with new ideas and technologies. very rarely have government programs had such a clear and measurable, positive and stimulating effect on the economy. sbir and sttr are also crucial to federal agencies as they solve many of our biggest science and technology challenges. giving small, innovative firms access to already appropriated federal r&d funding is a win-win--a win for the small business sector and just as importantly a win for the taxpayer and those agencies. these programs exist to foster innovation, to facilitate public- private partnerships, to give firms the funding they need to help 11 federal departments and agencies meet their r&d needs. these programs not only create jobs, but they also lead to a path for commercialization for many of these businesses, which is absolutely key to their success. these programs have been front and center in improving our nation's capacity to innovate. over the course of the sbir program history from 1982 to 2014--the last year for which we have numbers--federal agencies have made more than 152,000 sbir awards to small businesses to develop innovative technologies, and the total dollar amount awarded--again out of existing r&d budgets--is $42 billion. in 2014 alone, sbir gave nearly 5,500 phase i and phase ii awards worth about $2.2 billion, and the sba is currently reporting an average of 5,000 awards per year. these awards are directly responsible for some of the most popular technologies that are available to the public today. for instance, through an sbir award from the air force, we have created a technology known as lasik, originally to correct vision for pilots, but that is a widely used technology to correct vision for all americans. that was an sbir success. military armor has been a regular success of the sbir programs. armorworks is a great example. that created over 350,000 top-of-the- line body armor plates worn by u.s. service men and women in the united states. liftware spoon--a spoon that stabilizes hand tremors for patients with parkinson's disease and essential tremor--again is a clear, identifiable, and important sbir success story. hydromark decreases patient discomfort with a minimally invasive breast biopsy procedure. with the hydromark, a mammogram is no longer necessary and the surgeon or radiologist can use an ultrasound to locate the tumor. this is a huge innovation that has dramatically improved thousands of women's lives and, again, directly out of sbir. bioseal reduces lung collapse rates after lung biopsies. irobot's roomba is something i can relate to. it is moving around at home when i am there on the weekend. this is the popular autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner that has reached major commercial success, selling over 10 million units. that is directly out of sbir. these programs we are talking about, which have been so successful, are set to expire september 30 of 2017. as many of my colleagues can attest, it was a tumultuous process to complete the last reauthorization, so we are starting early now so we don't go through that tumultuous process again. back then--the last reauthorization-- participating agencies and firms had to endure a process that took over 3 years and 14 short-term extensions. in a bipartisan effort with senator shaheen, we have been working for the last year to avoid all that and to do this ahead of time so we don't have all of that tumult and uncertainty, which saps the effectiveness of the program for a significant period of time. reauthorizing these programs this year will ensure stability, foster an environment of innovative entrepreneurship, and avoid that uncertainty by directing more than $200 billion annually to this r&d funding to the nation's small business firms. as chair of the senate's small business committee, i have made this a real priority. senator shaheen, as ranking member, has done the same. so i thank all of our committee members who are solidly behind this effort. i also thank so many other members of the senate who have been cooperative. in the context of this defense bill, we have cleared our reauthorization amendment with the senate committee on armed services, and i want to specifically thank senators mccain and reed for their leadership. we have cleared it with the commerce committee because agencies under the jurisdiction of that committee are involved. we have cleared it with the help committee. they have the same tangential relationship. we are the authorizing committee, but some agencies involved are under their jurisdiction. we have cleared it with everyone in sight, so that means we have a real opportunity to have this in the managers' package--which it is, as i speak--and to pass it through the defense bill as a full reauthorization. i am also proud to share that not only will our reauthorization annually direct more than $2 billion of federal r&d to small firms that are most likely to create jobs and commercialize their projects, but it will also establish the regional sbir state collaborative initiative pilot program to help low-participation states attract r&d funding for their businesses. all of this reauthorization is a true consensus effort, so i am grateful to the more than 50 organizations that strongly support it-- among them the small business technology council, the national small business association and the defense alliance, and 47 more. it is a true consensus effort. they all support the effort, as does the leadership of sas; health, education, labor, and pensions; and the commerce committee. so it is an important opportunity that we shouldn't let fall through our grasp. again, i want to stress that reauthorizing this program is an effective way to meet national needs while jump-starting entrepreneurs, growing our economy, and creating jobs. with that, mr. president, i urge my colleagues to support this consensus amendment and help ensure that small businesses across the country can operate with long-term certainty and stability, which this amendment will provide. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from montana. mass shooting in orlando mr. daines. mr. president, the atrocity that occurred this past weekend in orlando, fl, was an attack on every american, and my deepest condolences are with the victims and the families of this appalling attack. i am grateful for our law enforcement and the first responders who bravely put their lives on the line to save others. this attack--the deadliest in american history since 9/11--was carried out by a gunman who pledged allegiance to isis. there are 49 families who received phone calls this weekend--phone calls we all hope we never receive. there are 49 families who are arranging for funerals this week. they never dreamed they would be put in this position--the tragedy, the sorrow of the mothers, the fathers, the aunts, the uncles, the brothers, the sisters, the grandparents, the cousins, and friends who will all be attending funerals this week. additionally, there are more than 50 families dealing with family members who were injured, some gravely, who are fighting for their lives as i speak. montana is a long ways away from orlando, but i can tell you that last night across our state there were vigils in great falls, helena, missoula, bozeman, butte, and billings, mt. we stand united with orlando. this threat of isis is continuing to grow each and every day. we need a strong strategy to destroy the growing threat of islamic extremism-- islamic extremism on our soil as well. president obama, what is that strategy? we need to aggressively go after radical jihadists who seek to destroy our way of life and disturb the peace in our communities. the senseless hate of isis and radical islam will not defeat us but, rather, strengthen our resolve and commitment to freedom. we need to remember that this was an act of terror on american soil, that this is a threat we face from radical islam and isis, and that the worst response would be to politicize this and use this tragedy to restrict our constitutional rights and freedoms. we cannot allow dangerous terrorists to hide in our communities. we need to seek them out and ensure they aren't [[page s3820]] able to inflict harm on our neighbors, our friends, and our families. may god comfort those who have been profoundly affected by this tragedy, and may god protect our men and women who are defending our country both here and abroad every day. we are a strong nation, and together we will protect our country and ensure victory over the terrorists who want to take away our very way of life here in america. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from montana. mr. tester. mr. president, i wish to associate myself with the remarks of the junior senator from montana. i appreciate his coming to the floor today. i rise today with a heavy heart. since i first heard the horrible news about the senseless act of terrorism in orlando, the victims, the partners, and the families have been at the center of my thoughts and prayers. but thoughts and prayers are not enough. it is long past time for the senate to come together and have a conversation about what steps need to be taken to put an end to this violence and hatred. we cannot continue to be crippled by inaction. the senate needs to come together to strengthen our national security. after attacks like orlando, we hear folks say ``never again,'' but actions really do speak louder than words. it is time that we work together to try to prevent these senseless acts of terror and violence. that conversation begins with our national security and what needs to be done to keep our families and our communities safe. there are actions we can take right now to bolster our national security. there is no question that we must pass legislation that keeps guns out of the hands of terrorists. we absolutely do need to secure our borders. and we need to continue to crack down on insider threats by reforming our security clearance process. intolerance and hate have no place in this country, and as elected leaders, we have a responsibility to ensure that every american can live their life each day free from fear. veterans first act mr. president, this nation has made a sacred promise to the men and women who have served in our armed forces. these folks answered a call to duty, and they made selfless sacrifices to protect the freedoms we all enjoy. these heroes stood up for us, and now it is time for the senate to stand up for them. two years ago, when reports surfaced that veterans were dying while waiting to receive care at the va, the senate acted swiftly, and we passed legislation to build the capacity of the va to better meet the needs of veterans now and into the future. also included in that bill was the veterans choice program, which allowed more veterans to seek care in their own community when they were unable to get timely care from the va. unfortunately, the choice program is broken. we have heard this from veterans and community leaders, from veteran service organizations, from republicans and from democrats. the intent of the choice program was a good one--to get veterans care more quickly--but the rollout has been disastrous, causing far too many veterans to wait even longer for an appointment. but because of the leadership of chairman isakson and ranking member blumenthal, the veterans' affairs committee came together in may and approved the veterans first act, which includes provisions that i and senator burr authored to fix the choice program. it also includes critical provisions to hold the va accountable, increase veterans access to care both inside and outside the va, and better deliver on the commitment this nation has made to the folks who have served. since this bill was unanimously passed out of committee back on may 16, it has fallen victim to politics as usual, and a combination of anonymous holds and the majority leader's decision not to bring it to the floor have put this bipartisan piece of legislation, this good piece of legislation for our veterans, in limbo. and now there are only 21 days left until the senate is set to recess for nearly 2 months. i am concerned that the clock is running out and that this bipartisan bill will fall victim to the senate's inaction. we cannot let business as usual here in washington, dc, derail critically needed reforms. veterans will not and should not accept excuses for the senate not acting. this is a good bill. it is a bill that gives the va the flexibility to work directly with community providers to connect veterans to the care they need so that the va does not need to work through a middleman. this bill also provides the budget flexibility necessary to ensure veterans are routed to care in a manner that makes the most sense for them. it imposes stricter rules to ensure the va is reimbursing community providers in a more timely manner. it also includes critical provisions that i helped author to ensure the va is able to more quickly fill leadership vacancies at va medical facilities. that is why today i am calling on the senate to put politics aside, put personal agendas aside, and get this bill to the floor for debate and for an up-or-down vote. the millions of veterans who are still being forced to wait more than 30 days to schedule an appointment deserve that vote. the veterans who are still kept on long wait lists deserve that vote. and the folks who have sacrificed so much to protect and defend this country deserve that vote. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. durbin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mass shooting in orlando mr. durbin. mr. president, early in the morning this past sunday, the worst mass shooting in america's history took place. forty-nine people were killed and 53 more wounded at the pulse nightclub in orlando, fl. we don't know all the details, but we know that this was an act of terror and that it was an act of hate directed at the lgbt community. i want to begin by expressing my condolences to the victims, to their families and loved ones, and to the city of orlando. i thank the first responders who ran toward the sound of gunfire, who literally risked their lives to save the lives of others. i express my support and solidarity with the lgbt community in orlando and throughout the nation. many of the patrons at the pulse nightclub were members of that community. they were simply enjoying a fun night out at an establishment that welcomed them. june is pride month. it is a month where we should take pride in the advances we have made toward equality since stonewall in 1969. the lgbt movement has come a long way in protecting americans' right to love the person they love. yet this weekend's shooting is a sobering reminder that this community still remains a target of vicious hatred. as we mourn those we lost in orlando, we must not lose our pride in what the lgbt movement has accomplished. we must stand in solidarity with our fellow lgbt americans who will not let the hate of a few overcome the love of an entire community. the shooter who perpetrated this horrific attack has been identified as a 29-year-old u.s. citizen who was living in st. lucie county, fl. the shooter reportedly entered the nightclub at about 2 a.m. on sunday morning, armed with an ar-15 assault rifle and a handgun. he opened fire on the patrons and engaged in a shoot-out with an off-duty orlando police officer who was working security at the nightclub. the shooter apparently held a number of hostages in the nightclub for several hours, until a swat team swarmed the building, killing the gunman at about 5 a.m. reportedly, the shooter called 911 to pledge allegiance to isis, even while the attack was under way. we do not yet know when and how this gunman may have been radicalized. reportedly, he had been the subject of at least two fbi investigations in recent years regarding possible ties to terrorist groups. the shooter reportedly bought the two guns he used on sunday within the last several days. he was able to buy these guns legally, despite the past [[page s3821]] investigations into his potential terrorist ties. let's be clear. in america, our laws currently allow dangerous people to buy guns. that has to change. i respect the second amendment to our constitution. that amendment protects the responsible use of guns for lawful purposes. but the supreme court has made it clear that it is constitutional to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. our lawmakers are simply not doing enough to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. right now, the fbi cannot stop a known or suspected terrorist from walking into a gunshop and walking out with an ar-15, an assault weapon. the gao found that between 2004 and 2014, suspected terrorists bought guns lawfully at least 2,043 times from american gun dealers. what are we thinking? last december, when the senate took up this measure, we failed on the floor of the senate to pass legislation to close this terror gap loophole. the gap remains open, and we have failed to close the gaping loopholes in our own background check system that allow terrorists, criminals, and others to get guns without a background check from gun shows or over the internet. why do we make it so easy for people that we suspect of being involved in terrorism to buy guns--assault weapons, military-style guns? last december, this senate failed again to pass manchin-toomey, a bill that would close many of these loopholes. this was a bipartisan bill, yet we couldn't pass it on the floor of the senate. we know our weak gun laws make us vulnerable, but we have not acted to strengthen them. in fact, almost every week we see efforts in congress to further weaken gun laws in america. hundreds of men, women, and children are shot every day in america, and on average 91 of those victims die. it is an epidemic of gun violence that has devastated families and communities in every state. no community has been hit harder than the city of chicago--the city i am honored to represent and the city i love and a city where this past weekend, 44 people were shot, 7 of them fatally. more than 1,650 people have been shot so far this year in chicago, with at least 282 victims dying from their wounds. the tragedy of orlando is that it all happened in a few hours. the tragedy of gun violence in chicago is that it happens almost every day. across the nation, we have seen americans gunned down in nightclubs, elementary schools, churches, temples, movie theaters, health care clinics, malls, colleges, and our homes and our neighborhoods. we need to wake up and act to reduce this violence. thoughts and prayers are important but not sufficient. we need votes and laws to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. can't we agree on that? the responsibility lies right here. we have that responsibility and that opportunity. this weekend's act of hate and terror in orlando has been condemned by americans of all backgrounds and all faiths, and orlando has received an extraordinary outpouring of support and solidarity from all across the united states and around the world. we do stand united against isis and its efforts to promote mass shootings and acts of terror. we stand in support of the lgbt community--the latest target of this terrorist attack. this solidarity is important. our efforts to defeat isis and keep america safe from hate and terror are strengthened when our nation and the world stand united. we must not let the actions of a hateful few divide us and prevent us from working together to combat this evil. we also must not let this act of hate and terror lead to hostility against the muslim community in america. the american muslim community has stood with all americans in condemning sunday's mass shooting. american muslim leaders immediately spoke out and condemned the attack. muslim floridians donated blood and money to help the victims and survivors. in the coming days, there will be those who say we should respond to this attack by discriminating against innocent american muslims and immigrants. but the solution to hate is not more hate; it is unity. in orlando, they understand this. in a news conference after the shooting, a representative of equality florida recognized the unity between the lgbt and muslim communities, stating that his organization ``stands in solidarity with the muslim and islamic community in opposition to the intolerance, discrimination, and hate crimes that both of our communities experience.'' that was a statement by the representative of equality florida about muslims in florida itself. it is unfortunate that the presumptive republican presidential nominee, donald trump, does not understand this. in response to the orlando attack, mr. trump wasted no time calling again for a ban on all muslims immigrating to the united states. general michael hayden is no softy, no liberal. he was director of the cia, and the national security agency under president george w. bush. here is what general hayden said of mr. trump's response to the attack: ``prejudiced, simplistic, and frankly inaccurate.'' general hayden has pointed out that banning all muslim immigration would not make us safer and actually helps isis recruit those who hate the united states. as we mourn those we have lost, we must also roll up our sleeves and get to work. we must pursue smart, commonsense reforms to keep dangerous, hateful people from getting their hands on dangerous weapons. america just suffered its deadliest mass shooting event in history--worse than san bernardino, worse than newtown, worse than virginia tech. if there was ever a time for congress to do its job and keep guns out of dangerous hands, this is it. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from georgia. mr. isakson. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to address the senate as in morning business. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. isakson. mr. president, first and foremost, i wish to send my heartfelt sympathy to those who have lost loved ones in orlando, fl, in orange county, yesterday in a tragic event. i want to express my great appreciation to the people of orlando who volunteered their blood, their families, and their houses to help support those victims; to the emts who rushed into harm's way to save lives--and they did save lives--and to the hospital trauma team that did an amazing job of responding instantaneously to a tragedy beyond anybody's comprehension. we are very sad in america today by the terrible attack that took place and those who would perpetrate it. i, for one, am going to roll up my sleeves and work to see to it that wherever radical islamic terrorism is, i want to root it out and i want to destroy it. you cannot accept or tolerate what happened yesterday, and we must redouble our effort to follow it wherever it leads us and to wipe it out and to eradicate it. i, as one senator, will promise to do that. commerce-justice-science appropriations bill mr. president, i am one of those guys who usually is very supportive of going to cloture and going on motions to proceed on just about anything because i think the senate is the most deliberative body in the world and we ought to do that. but tomorrow, shortly after 11 o'clock, i am going to vote no on the motion to proceed to the commerce-justice-science bill. i want to memorialize why on the floor of the senate tonight so everybody is clear and understands. there is report language in the commerce-justice-science portion of the appropriations bill that directly interjects this congress, this senate, and the u.s. house of representatives into a tristate water compact misunderstanding among the states of georgia, alabama, and florida that has gone on for 27 years. i know that is of no interest to the presiding officer from indiana, nor to the senator who just preceded me from chicago, il, nor anybody else, but what is of interest to you would be any time that congress decided to interject its nose in your business. tomorrow, if the motion to proceed brings it to the floor, it will be injecting 100 senators into an issue among 6 senators. that is not the right way to do it. in fact, the tristate water compact, which has been off and on in negotiations for 26 years, [[page s3822]] is at its closest point of being finally decided in a court of law. the judge and the special master recently notified us that they will hear the final case on the tristate water compact in georgia, alabama, and florida this november. so the issue is going to be resolved. we have no place as a senate or as a congress to inject ourselves into a case that is pending litigation in the courts between states on issues that are purely theirs--except for the fact that over the years, for nefarious reasons and unpleasant reasons, sometimes congress has from time to time thwarted water control manuals, thwarted the authority of the corps of engineers from doing its job, all over litigation of the acf and ac basins in georgia, florida, and alabama. i want to bring a resolution. i want all the states to have an adequate supply of water. i want us to be cooperative and work together, and i want us to do it the right way. the right way is to not interject ourselves at the last minute in an appropriations bill with nefarious language that can't be touched that is in the report language but, instead, to pull that language out, as i will try to do with an amendment on the floor. if i am unsuccessful, i will try to do an amendment that counteracts that language, to see to it that congress does not stick its nose in a place that it does not belong. i like to be cooperative. i like to move forward. i don't want to slow down progress. but i was sent here to represent 10.4 million people in the state of georgia and, by golly, i am going to do it. if somebody is trying to inject themselves beyond the appropriate place, i am going to do everything i can to stop them. the way i will start that tomorrow will be to vote no on the motion to proceed to go to the commerce-justice-science bill. i yield back my time. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. casey. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. casey. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mass shooting in orlando mr. casey. mr. president, i rise this afternoon to talk about the horror of orlando, and i know so many members of the senate on both sides of the aisle have been thinking about those who lost their lives and talking about this horror that once again has impacted everyone from one end of america to the other. i won't speak for a long time tonight other than to say--which i think is plainly evident from the evidence we have right now at this point in the investigation--that this was first an act of terror and it was also an act of hate. i think both are significant because of the impact they have on our country over time. i think there is a strong belief that the first thing we must do is to express not just condolence but solidarity with the people of orlando, the people of florida, and to do what we can to help them and help those communities and families who lost so much in such a short timeframe. at last count, there are 50 dead and more than 50 injured. there will be some who say that beyond that, there is not much we can do, that we should just stay where we are now and not change the laws. i don't agree with that, and i won't dwell on a long list tonight, but i hope at some point we can begin to reengage on a number of issues and at least have a full debate and also a series of votes on a couple of measures which i think are common sense. these are issues that we voted on i believe most recently in 2013, and i was hoping we would vote on them after that. one of the votes had to do with a ban on military-style weapons. i think it would be appropriate to at least debate and vote on it. i would vote in favor of it, and some would not. we should certainly have a vote on the size of the clips, or the magazines. to put it plainly, how many bullets should one person have in their possession or as part of the weapon at any one time? should someone be allowed to go into any kind of establishment and start shooting, thereby releasing rounds and rounds of ammunition and hundreds and hundreds of bullets? should that be permitted to anyone at any time or anywhere? i don't think so. if someone is on the terror watch list and that person has been deemed so dangerous that we have labeled him or her as a terrorist or potential terrorist and he or she can't get on an airplane, certainly that person should not have a weapon. that seems to make sense. if they are too dangerous to get on a plane because of their tendency to commit acts of violence or engage in terror, they shouldn't be able to have a firearm. i think it would make sense to have a debate and vote on that issue. another issue is background checks. that was one measure where there was a lot of consensus or substantial bipartisan support, but it didn't pass in 2013. i hope we can have another vote on that. if a person is not able to get through a background check due to a whole variety of reasons, such as having a criminal record or otherwise, you have to ask yourself, should someone with a criminal record have access to a firearm? mr. president, today i have introduced the hate crimes prevention act, s. 3053. that is a new proposal to do what some states have done already. i think it is essential to add this to the other pieces of legislation that have been talked about and some that i just itemized. this bill, first of all, would define what a misdemeanor hate crime is because the intent of the bill is to say: if you are convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime, you shouldn't have access to a firearm. this category of misdemeanors would be under federal, state, or tribal law that are found to be motivated, at least in part, by hate or bias against the victim's race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. in essence, these eight categories are what some would call, to use the more legal jargon, the protected classes. that is how we would define a misdemeanor hate crime. this bill, upon passage, would keep firearms out of the hands of those convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes. it would prohibit the purchase, possession, or shipment of a firearm by anyone convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime. that is the basics of the bill. obviously it doesn't have direct application to what happened in orlando; however, upon further investigation, we may find that it does. part of the reason for this is because there has been a rise not only in hate crimes but in hate groups across the country, with hundreds more in just the last couple of years, and literally thousands more, if not more, hate crimes have been committed. those issues i mentioned are among the many things we need to address. i also think that in addition to taking these steps on commonsense gun measures, we have to make sure law enforcement has the resources it needs to take on the challenge of not just criminal activity but increasingly almost terroristic activity within our communities--the so-called lone wolf terrorist, the homegrown terrorist, the individual who is self-radicalized, which seems to be part of the horror of orlando. we have to make sure that if law enforcement professionals tell us they need more money in the cops program, we should appropriate more money. if the law enforcement professionals say: please fund that program that has worked for so many years, such as the byrne justice assistance grants, we should make sure they have those appropriations. if you are tough on law enforcement-- that is nice to say, but it is better to prove it by how you vote. finally, of course, we have to continue to focus on what is a major component, of course, of orlando and san bernardino and so many other places, and that is violent extremism in communities across the country. we have to make sure we are working with local law enforcement and federal authorities not only to give them the resources they need but to be able to coordinate and do our best to unearth plots before they transpire and to be able to take this fight directly to a terrorist, many of whom are in our midst here in the united states. [[page s3823]] we have a lot to do. it is not simply a question of what we do on a series of commonsense gun measures, it is also a question of what we are going to do to help our law enforcement and to work as hard as we can in a bipartisan way to debate and vote on measures that will keep our country safe and protect our homeland. unfortunately, we are seeing more and more of a rise in these individuals who are, as i mentioned before, self-radicalized and sometimes categorized as a lone wolf. we have to make sure we are doing everything possible to identify them, apprehend them, and make sure we are thwarting these plots ahead of time. it may not work in every instance, but we have to take every measure possible. i think part of that is doing what i hope we can do as a matter of preventive steps. if someone is engaging in hate and taking action against others, even if it only rises to the level of a misdemeanor, they shouldn't have access to a firearm. we want to nip this in the bud, stop it long before that hate continues and develops into the kind of hate that leads to a much greater and more lethal attack on americans. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",61496

CREC-2016-06-13-pt1-PgS3823-3,CREC-2016-06-13,114,"HOUSE PASSAGE OF S. 337, THE FOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3823-S3824] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOUSE PASSAGE OF S. 337, THE FOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Freedom of Information Act, our Nation's premier transparency law, is on the eve of its 50th anniversary, July 4, 2016. It is fitting that FOIA shares its birthday with our Republic itself. Our democracy is built upon the principle that a government of, by, and for the people cannot be one that is hidden from them. Today we recommit ourselves to this ideal by sending to the President the FOIA Improvement Act. This bill, which I coauthored with Senator Cornyn, ushers in the most significant reforms to FOIA since its enactment 50 [[Page S3824]] years ago. With the House's unanimous passage of our legislation today, we ensure FOIA will remain strong for another 50 years. First and foremost, the FOIA Improvement Act codifies a ``presumption of openness,'' putting the force of law behind the notion that sunshine, not secrecy, is the default setting of our government. This is the same language President Obama laid out in his historic memorandum in 2009 and which now applies to government agencies. This policy was first put into place by President Bill Clinton, but then it was reversed by President George W. Bush. President Obama reinstated it as one of his first acts in office. However, self-imposed executive orders provide the executive branch overly-broad latitude in adhering to its letter and spirit. We must remember, the executive branch uniquely conducts much of its business behind closed doors, which is why we need strong legislation ensuring accountability and transparency. By codifying the ``presumption of openness,'' we ensure that all future administrations operate under the presumption that government information belongs in the hands of the people. Furthermore, our bill provides the Office of Government Information Services--OGIS--an office Senator Cornyn and I created in the OPEN Government Act of 2007--additional authority to operate more independently and communicate freely with Congress how FOIA is operating and what improvements can be made. And to bring FOIA into the digital age, our bill creates a singular online portal through which the American public can submit FOIA requests and requires the proactive online disclosure of frequently requested records. The reforms in our bill enjoy broad bipartisan support. The Senate has unanimously voted for our FOIA Improvement Act twice. Last Congress, the Democratically controlled Senate unanimously passed this bill, but Republican leaders in the House failed to bring it up. Senator Cornyn and I promptly reintroduced our legislation, which passed the Senate earlier this year, and finally, the House has followed suit. The legislative branch has now spoken in one voice, reaffirming its commitment to the American people's right to know what their government is doing. I urge President Obama to swiftly sign our bill into law in time for FOIA's 50th anniversary. The FOIA Improvement Act is undoubtedly a legislative achievement worth celebrating. However, we must not rest on our laurels. Just as we are about to bring more sunshine into the halls of power with this new law, the National Defense Authorization Act, S. 2943, being considered by the Senate, threatens to cast a shadow over our efforts. Without ever consulting the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has exclusive jurisdiction over FOIA, the Senate Armed Services Committee included provisions in the NDAA that directly undermine central pillars of FOIA. One particularly egregious provision is so broadly drafted that it could create a wholesale carveout of the Department of Defense from our Nation's transparency and accountability regime. If enacted into law, this could empower the Pentagon to withhold a nearly limitless amount of information from the American public. For example, the Pentagon could withhold the legal justifications for drone strikes against U.S. citizens, preventing the American people from knowing the legal basis upon which their government can employ lethal force against them. It could withhold from disclosure documents memorializing civilian killings by U.S. forces, depriving the American people of knowledge about the human cost of wars fought in their name. And if enacted, the Pentagon could withhold information about sexual assaults in the military, masking the true extent of sexual violence against soldiers who risk their lives defending our country. I will continue to oppose inclusion of this provision in the final NDAA. Fifty years from now, on FOIA's centennial anniversary, the next generation will look back to this moment. They will gauge our commitment to creating a government that is open to its people. With today's passage of the bipartisan FOIA Improvement Act, we have chosen to let the sunshine in. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3823-S3824] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOUSE PASSAGE OF S. 337, THE FOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mr. LEAHY.

However, self-imposed executive orders provide the executive branch overly-broad latitude in adhering to its letter and spirit. We must remember, the executive branch uniquely conducts much of its business behind closed doors, which is why we need strong legislation ensuring accountability and transparency. By codifying the ``presumption of openness,'' we ensure that all future administrations operate under the presumption that government information belongs in the hands of the people. Furthermore, our bill provides the Office of Government Information Services--OGIS--an office Senator Cornyn and I created in the OPEN Government Act of 2007--additional authority to operate more independently and communicate freely with Congress how FOIA is operating and what improvements can be made. And to bring FOIA into the digital age, our bill creates a singular online portal through which the American public can submit FOIA requests and requires the proactive online disclosure of frequently requested records. The reforms in our bill enjoy broad bipartisan support. The Senate has unanimously voted for our FOIA Improvement Act twice. Last Congress, the Democratically controlled Senate unanimously passed this bill, but Republican leaders in the House failed to bring it up. Senator Cornyn and I promptly reintroduced our legislation, which passed the Senate earlier this year, and finally, the House has followed suit. The legislative branch has now spoken in one voice, reaffirming its commitment to the American people's right to know what their government is doing. I urge President Obama to swiftly sign our bill into law in time for FOIA's 50th anniversary. The FOIA Improvement Act is undoubtedly a legislative achievement worth celebrating. However, we must not rest on our laurels. Just as we are about to bring more sunshine into the halls of power with this new law, the National Defense Authorization Act, S. 2943, being considered by the Senate, threatens to cast a shadow over our efforts. Without ever consulting the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has exclusive jurisdiction over FOIA, the Senate Armed Services Committee included provisions in the NDAA that directly undermine central pillars of FOIA. One particularly egregious provision is so broadly drafted that it could create a wholesale carveout of the Department of Defense from our Nation's transparency and accountability regime. If enacted into law, this could empower the Pentagon to withhold a nearly limitless amount of information from the American public. For example, the Pentagon could withhold the legal justifications for drone strikes against U.S. citizens, preventing the American people from knowing the legal basis upon which their government can employ lethal force against them. It could withhold from disclosure documents memorializing civilian killings by U.S. forces, depriving the American people of knowledge about the human cost of wars fought in their name. And if enacted, the Pentagon could withhold information about sexual assaults in the military, masking the true extent of sexual violence against soldiers who risk their lives defending our country. I will continue to oppose inclusion of this provision in the final NDAA. Fifty years from now, on FOIA's centennial anniversary, the next generation will look back to this moment. They will gauge our commitment to creating a government that is open to its people. With today's passage of the bipartisan FOIA Improvement Act, we have chosen to let the sunshine in. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3823-S3824] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOUSE PASSAGE OF S. 337, THE FOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Freedom of Information Act, our Nation's premier transparency law, is on the eve of its 50th anniversary, July 4, 2016. It is fitting that FOIA shares its birthday with our Republic itself. Our democracy is built upon the principle that a government of, by, and for the people cannot be one that is hidden from them. Today we recommit ourselves to this ideal by sending to the President the FOIA Improvement Act. This bill, which I coauthored with Senator Cornyn, ushers in the most significant reforms to FOIA since its enactment 50 [[Page S3824]] years ago. With the House's unanimous passage of our legislation today, we ensure FOIA will remain strong for another 50 years. First and foremost, the FOIA Improvement Act codifies a ``presumption of openness,'' putting the force of law behind the notion that sunshine, not secrecy, is the default setting of our government.

CREC-2016-06-13-pt1-PgS3823-2,CREC-2016-06-13,114,"REMEMBERING ROLAND ""KEN"" TOWERY","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3823] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING ROLAND ``KEN'' TOWERY Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to a great American veteran, public servant, leader, and Texan, Mr. Roland ``Ken'' Towery. Ken passed away on May 4, 2016, at the age of 93. Ken personified integrity, sacrifice, and hard work as a member of the Greatest Generation. He will be sorely missed by the family he leaves behind, those whose lives he touched, and a grateful Nation. Ken was born in 1923 in Smithville, MS, but quickly moved to Texas a year later. Ken grew up on his family's farm in Willacy County. When Ken was 14, they moved to farm land on the Medina River near San Antonio. The day Ken turned 18, he enlisted in the Army. He was later asked about why he enlisted, and he said, ``I wanted to see the world and signed up asking for service as far away from home as the Army could send me.'' A few short months later, Ken sailed to the Philippines on the USS Republic. He received basic and advanced individual training on Corregidor Island in Manila Bay; he served as a crew member for the 75mm antiaircraft guns with Battery C, 60th Coast Artillery. In the initial months of America's involvement in World War II, the 60th Coast Artillery joined with the 59th Coast Artillery to defend the Bataan Peninsula, blocking the Japanese Navy from Manila Bay. Ken and his fellow soldiers fought gallantly; many, including Ken, were awarded the Purple Heart for injuries received in defense of the island. In May of 1942, the island fell to the Japanese, and Ken was captured. For the duration of World War II, Ken was a prisoner of war in Manchuria. As a POW, he worked in the MKK factory making equipment to be exported. Ken eventually acquired an extra duty serving prisoners their meals, more commonly referred to as ``slop,'' filling a role referred to as the ``chow dipper.'' Serving as a chow dipper was often a short-lived and precarious position because they were subject to fights and disagreements from prisoners who were unhappy about their meager rations. This changed when Ken became the chow dipper. He employed the lesson that his parents taught him to ``do unto others.'' He remedied disagreements by first filling his own bowl and placing it beside the serving bucket. Any man who was unsatisfied with his serving was invited to replace his serving with Ken's. This small action demonstrated Ken's dedication to fairness and firmly established his role as a leader amongst his fellow prisoners. In 1945, Ken returned home, where he faced a steep recovery from multiple parasitic diseases common amongst former prisoners of war. Additionally, Ken returned with a serious case of tuberculosis, which forced him to spend the bulk of the next decade in isolation wards of TB sanitariums. As he battled TB, Ken studied at Southwest Texas Junior College and was later admitted to Texas A&M University to study soil biology. It was during this time that Ken met his future wife, Louise Ida Cook, from Knippa, TX. After their wedding, Ken continued college until another bout with tuberculosis occurred and ended his formal education. After his hospitalization, Ken cleaned poultry houses to make a living. In 1950, the Cuero Record, Ken's local newspaper, announced they were looking for a reporter. Ken applied for the position but lacked one critical skill: the ability to use a typewriter. Louise taught Ken to type, helping him to land the job. Ken's hard work led him to investigate allegations regarding businessmen who were abusing the State's veteran's land program and State officials who chose to ignore the issue. This later became known as the Veteran's Land Scandal. As a result of his research and reporting, 20 people were indicted, and the Texas land commissioner was removed from office and imprisoned. In 1955, Ken was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his work. Soon after, Ken, Louise, and their two children moved to Austin, where Ken worked as a political reporter for the Austin American Statesman. His insight into politics was noticed by recently elected U.S. Senator John Tower, who asked Ken to serve as his press secretary. He quickly climbed the ladder and became Senator Tower's chief of staff. After leaving Tower's staff, Ken remained influential in Republican politics for more than 20 years, during which time he managed several reelection campaigns, including Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign in Texas. Ken's political impacts extended beyond the United States. He also served the U.S. Information Agency as deputy director and assistant director. While there, he played a major behind-the-scenes role in the fight against communism and the demise of the Soviet Union. He said the years spent at USIA ``were among the most gratifying `employed' years of my life . . . I could go home at night feeling like I had struck a blow for liberty, for mankind . . . There was the feeling that our labors were directed towards the interest of the nation as a whole.'' Ken then returned to Texas, where he started a political consulting business in 1976. In 1981, President Regan appointed him to the board of directors of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and he served as the elected chairman of the board twice. Ken eventually returned to the newspaper business in the 1990s when he purchased three small town publications: The Floyd County Hesperian, the Lockney Beacon, and the Crosby County News-Chronicle. Of all his many accomplishments, this humble man will rest in the Texas State Cemetery beneath the headstone that reads ``The Chow Dipper.'' Ken Towery's story of perseverance, work ethic, and fortitude should inspire us all. I offer my thanks and appreciation to this great and humble man who epitomizes the American spirit. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3823] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING ROLAND ``KEN'' TOWERY Mr. CORNYN.

many, including ken, were awarded the purple heart for injuries received in defense of the island. in may of 1942, the island fell to the japanese, and ken was captured. for the duration of world war ii, ken was a prisoner of war in manchuria. as a pow, he worked in the mkk factory making equipment to be exported. ken eventually acquired an extra duty serving prisoners their meals, more commonly referred to as ``slop,'' filling a role referred to as the ``chow dipper.'' serving as a chow dipper was often a short-lived and precarious position because they were subject to fights and disagreements from prisoners who were unhappy about their meager rations. this changed when ken became the chow dipper. he employed the lesson that his parents taught him to ``do unto others.'' he remedied disagreements by first filling his own bowl and placing it beside the serving bucket. any man who was unsatisfied with his serving was invited to replace his serving with ken's. this small action demonstrated ken's dedication to fairness and firmly established his role as a leader amongst his fellow prisoners. in 1945, ken returned home, where he faced a steep recovery from multiple parasitic diseases common amongst former prisoners of war. additionally, ken returned with a serious case of tuberculosis, which forced him to spend the bulk of the next decade in isolation wards of tb sanitariums. as he battled tb, ken studied at southwest texas junior college and was later admitted to texas a&m university to study soil biology. it was during this time that ken met his future wife, louise ida cook, from knippa, tx. after their wedding, ken continued college until another bout with tuberculosis occurred and ended his formal education. after his hospitalization, ken cleaned poultry houses to make a living. in 1950, the cuero record, ken's local newspaper, announced they were looking for a reporter. ken applied for the position but lacked one critical skill: the ability to use a typewriter. louise taught ken to type, helping him to land the job. ken's hard work led him to investigate allegations regarding businessmen who were abusing the state's veteran's land program and state officials who chose to ignore the issue. this later became known as the veteran's land scandal. as a result of his research and reporting, 20 people were indicted, and the texas land commissioner was removed from office and imprisoned. in 1955, ken was awarded the pulitzer prize for his work. soon after, ken, louise, and their two children moved to austin, where ken worked as a political reporter for the austin american statesman. his insight into politics was noticed by recently elected u.s. senator john tower, who asked ken to serve as his press secretary. he quickly climbed the ladder and became senator tower's chief of staff. after leaving tower's staff, ken remained influential in republican politics for more than 20 years, during which time he managed several reelection campaigns, including richard nixon's 1968 campaign in texas. ken's political impacts extended beyond the united states. he also served the u.s. information agency as deputy director and assistant director. while there, he played a major behind-the-scenes role in the fight against communism and the demise of the soviet union. he said the years spent at usia ``were among the most gratifying `employed' years of my life . . . i could go home at night feeling like i had struck a blow for liberty, for mankind . . . there was the feeling that our labors were directed towards the interest of the nation as a whole.'' ken then returned to texas, where he started a political consulting business in 1976. in 1981, president regan appointed him to the board of directors of the corporation for public broadcasting, and he served as the elected chairman of the board twice. ken eventually returned to the newspaper business in the 1990s when he purchased three small town publications: the floyd county hesperian, the lockney beacon, and the crosby county news-chronicle. of all his many accomplishments, this humble man will rest in the texas state cemetery beneath the headstone that reads ``the chow dipper.'' ken towery's story of perseverance, work ethic, and fortitude should inspire us all. i offer my thanks and appreciation to this great and humble man who epitomizes the american spirit. ____________________",5946

Mr. President, on June 10, 2016, the Congressional Budget Office released a detailed cost estimate for S. 2943, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. This measure was reported by the Senate Committee on Armed Services on May 18, 2016, and includes provisions that affect authorizations for appropriations, revenues, and direct spending. As chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget, I will use this estimate for scorekeeping and budget enforcement purposes. Senators and their staff can access the full estimate on CBO's website, www.cbo.gov/publication/51683 . Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of CBO's cost estimate be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate S. 2943--National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (June 10, 2016) Summary: S. 2943 would authorize appropriations totaling an estimated $603.9 billion for the military functions of the Department of Defense (DoD), for certain activities of the Department of Energy (DOE), and for other purposes. In addition, S. 2943 would prescribe personnel strengths for each active-duty and selected-reserve component of the U.S. armed forces. CBO estimates that appropriation of the authorized amounts would result in outlays of $587.8 billion over the 2017-2021 period. Of the amount authorized for 2017, $544.1 billion--if appropriated--would count against that year's defense cap set in the Budget Control Act (BCA), as amended. Another $0.2 billion authorized for nondefense programs would count against the nondefense cap and an additional $58.9 billion authorized and designated for overseas contingency operations would not be constrained by caps. The bill also contains provisions that would affect the costs of defense programs funded through discretionary appropriations in 2018 and future years. Those provisions mainly would affect force structure, compensation and benefits, the military health system, and various procurement programs. CBO has analyzed the costs of a select number of those provisions and estimates that they would, on a net basis, decrease the cost of those programs relative to current law by about $14 billion over the 2018-2021 period. The net costs of those provisions in 2018 and beyond are not included in the total amount of outlays mentioned above because funding for those activities would be covered by specific authorizations in future years. In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill would increase direct spending by $10.9 billion over the 2017-2026 period. S. 2943 would have an insignificant effect on revenues. Because enacting the bill would affect direct spending and revenues, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. CBO estimates that enacting S. 2943 would increase net direct spending and on-budget deficits by more than $5 billion in each of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2027. S. 2943 contains intergovernmental and private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). CBO estimates that the aggregate costs of the mandates would fall below the annual thresholds established in UMRA for intergovernmental and private-sector mandates ($77 million and $154 million in 2016, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation). ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3824] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CBO COST ESTIMATE--S. 2943 Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay special tribute to Jack Livingston, a key member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence staff for more than 12 years. Jack's lifelong commitment to our national security began when he was just a young man and heeded the call to service when he joined the Civil Air Patrol. Some years later, he joined the Navy, followed by more than 7 years of distinguished service at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His memory of being on the floor of the Strategic Information and Operations Center at the FBI in the hours after 9/11, when so many others in Washington, DC, had hurried to safety, remained with him every day and became his driver and, in turn, a motivator for younger staff. Jack subsequently joined the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence where he has served for the last 13 years. As general counsel for the majority and minority, Jack not only helped shape national policy on key intelligence matters, but he served as a personal and professional mentor to dozens of committee and congressional staff, on both sides of the aisle. From the all-nighters before mark-up, reviewing amendments and writing and [[Page S3825]] proofing countless sets of talking points, to somehow always assigning himself a larger ``equal'' share of the work, Jack has led by example. His meticulous nature and sound reasoning were essential as the committee produced reports or majority or minority views on significant matters of national security, from Iraq WMD to interrogation and detention. It did not matter how busy Jack was because he would always find time to talk through an intelligence issue with a colleague, proofread a floor statement, or just listen. Many staff knocked on his open door and were greeted without hesitation by a kind word or invitation to sit down and discuss a question more in-depth. Many of Jack's colleagues have had the privilege of working with him for years. Ask them what words describe Jack best, and you will likely hear ``integrity,'' ``honesty,'' ``impeccable character,'' ``devoted family man,'' and ``all-around good guy''--and unique: while an ardent Indiana University and Bobby Knight fan, his California roots easily showed themselves as he called his colleagues ``dude'' during debates. Jack was often kidded about catching a joke; the deadpan expression on his face was usually belied by a twinkle in his eye that said the joke was really on you. Jack is loyal to the core, and he understood well the importance of providing accurate information and sound advice to members of the committee, a point on which I am sure my predecessors, Senators Chambliss, Bond, and Roberts, would agree. Jack had the ability, all too rare in Congress, to put politics aside and focus on the mission and on what was best for the Nation. His colleagues knew they could engage in spirited but never personal debates. Jack always stuck to the facts and his arguments were based on logic, not emotion. As a result, members of the committee--Republican, Democrat, and Independent--sought his counsel on a wide range of issues. As the minority and majority general counsel, Jack enjoyed some major successes in national security legislation. From the Protect America Act to the FISA Amendments Act, Jack worked tirelessly to secure the best result for our terrorist surveillance capabilities. Jack was passionate about this issue and understood it better than pretty much anyone else. The committee's FISA audit was a hallmark of Jack's early tenure on the committee and provided the impetus for many improvements in the conduct of national security investigations and for later legislation in which Jack played significant roles. Jack led the committee's passage of the Cyber Information Sharing Act of 2015, the product of years of bipartisan work and compromise on an issue that has taken on new urgency with the increase in cyber threats, and of numerous intelligence authorization acts that secured critical authorities and capabilities for our intelligence professionals. It is often said that behind every great man, there is a greater woman, and in Jack's case, that is certainly true--and I have no doubt Jack would agree. Jack's tireless service was made possible, not just because of his own character, but because he was confident in the love and support of his wife, Julie, and their children, John, James, and Sarah. For their own sacrifices and for their willingness to share Jack with the committee, we are indebted to them. Jack has earned our respect and admiration, and we will miss his sound counsel and friendship, but his legacy will remain a part of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3824-S3825] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JACK LIVINGSTON Mr. BURR.

Jack's tireless service was made possible, not just because of his own character, but because he was confident in the love and support of his wife, Julie, and their children, John, James, and Sarah. For their own sacrifices and for their willingness to share Jack with the committee, we are indebted to them. Jack has earned our respect and admiration, and we will miss his sound counsel and friendship, but his legacy will remain a part of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for years to come. ____________________",package_114_183.csv,4950,4950,5016,"[congressional record volume 162, number 93 (monday, june 13, 2016)] [senate] [pages s3824-s3825] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] tribute to jack livingston mr. burr. mr. president, today i wish to pay special tribute to jack livingston, a key member of the senate select committee on intelligence staff for more than 12 years. jack's lifelong commitment to our national security began when he was just a young man and heeded the call to service when he joined the civil air patrol. some years later, he joined the navy, followed by more than 7 years of distinguished service at the federal bureau of investigation. his memory of being on the floor of the strategic information and operations center at the fbi in the hours after 9/11, when so many others in washington, dc, had hurried to safety, remained with him every day and became his driver and, in turn, a motivator for younger staff. jack subsequently joined the senate select committee on intelligence where he has served for the last 13 years. as general counsel for the majority and minority, jack not only helped shape national policy on key intelligence matters, but he served as a personal and professional mentor to dozens of committee and congressional staff, on both sides of the aisle. from the all-nighters before mark-up, reviewing amendments and writing and [[page s3825]] proofing countless sets of talking points, to somehow always assigning himself a larger ``equal'' share of the work, jack has led by example. his meticulous nature and sound reasoning were essential as the committee produced reports or majority or minority views on significant matters of national security, from iraq wmd to interrogation and detention. it did not matter how busy jack was because he would always find time to talk through an intelligence issue with a colleague, proofread a floor statement, or just listen. many staff knocked on his open door and were greeted without hesitation by a kind word or invitation to sit down and discuss a question more in-depth. many of jack's colleagues have had the privilege of working with him for years. ask them what words describe jack best, and you will likely hear ``integrity,'' ``honesty,'' ``impeccable character,'' ``devoted family man,'' and ``all-around good guy''--and unique: while an ardent indiana university and bobby knight fan, his california roots easily showed themselves as he called his colleagues ``dude'' during debates. jack was often kidded about catching a joke; the deadpan expression on his face was usually belied by a twinkle in his eye that said the joke was really on you. jack is loyal to the core, and he understood well the importance of providing accurate information and sound advice to members of the committee, a point on which i am sure my predecessors, senators chambliss, bond, and roberts, would agree. jack had the ability, all too rare in congress, to put politics aside and focus on the mission and on what was best for the nation. his colleagues knew they could engage in spirited but never personal debates. jack always stuck to the facts and his arguments were based on logic, not emotion. as a result, members of the committee--republican, democrat, and independent--sought his counsel on a wide range of issues. as the minority and majority general counsel, jack enjoyed some major successes in national security legislation. from the protect america act to the fisa amendments act, jack worked tirelessly to secure the best result for our terrorist surveillance capabilities. jack was passionate about this issue and understood it better than pretty much anyone else. the committee's fisa audit was a hallmark of jack's early tenure on the committee and provided the impetus for many improvements in the conduct of national security investigations and for later legislation in which jack played significant roles. jack led the committee's passage of the cyber information sharing act of 2015, the product of years of bipartisan work and compromise on an issue that has taken on new urgency with the increase in cyber threats, and of numerous intelligence authorization acts that secured critical authorities and capabilities for our intelligence professionals. it is often said that behind every great man, there is a greater woman, and in jack's case, that is certainly true--and i have no doubt jack would agree. jack's tireless service was made possible, not just because of his own character, but because he was confident in the love and support of his wife, julie, and their children, john, james, and sarah. for their own sacrifices and for their willingness to share jack with the committee, we are indebted to them. jack has earned our respect and admiration, and we will miss his sound counsel and friendship, but his legacy will remain a part of the senate select committee on intelligence for years to come. ____________________",4950

McCORMACK Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I extend my sincere appreciation and gratitude to Dennis X. McCormack for his tireless contributions to bettering the lives of Colorado's veterans. Dennis could have relaxed after retiring. He had earned it after 26 years in the military as an Army chief warrant officer, CW5, helicopter pilot from Fort Bragg's XVIII Airborne Corps and 12 more years in the private sector. Instead, Dennis was committed to service. Before retirement, he was giving his time, expertise, and passion to veterans, military families, and soldiers facing deployment and the difficulties of day-to-day life. Every day, the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces make incalculable contributions to our society. Dennis recognized a responsibility to support those contributions and made his own. He served with many organizations such as the Suicide Prevention Partnership of the Pikes Peak Region, LifeQuest Transitions, the Home Front Cares, Inc., Sentinels of Freedom--Colorado Springs Chapter, and South East Armed Forces YMCA, Colorado Springs. He served as a peer mentor for Colorado's El Paso County Veterans Trauma Court, a program he helped found. He also served in the first group of AW2 advocates for the Army Wounded Warrior Program and was an organizer of the Colorado injured military support group. I had the distinct honor of meeting Dennis in 2011, and I have worked with him in the intervening years. His deep dedication to veterans was clear, and that passion inspires my work on behalf of our Nation's veterans. He has received the American Red Cross Hometown Hero Community Service Award, the President's Award from Homefront Cares, and the Joe Henjum ``Service Above Self'' Award from the Rotary Club of Colorado Springs. These speak to his integrity, character, and commitment to the community. Dennis demonstrates the best of Colorado, and his tireless service has helped make our State one of the best places for our servicemembers, veterans, and their families to live. I add my recognition of his service, knowing that his work contributes to a stronger and a safer nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3825] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ TRIBUTE TO DENNIS X.

CREC-2016-06-13-pt1-PgS3825-2,CREC-2016-06-13,114,TRIBUTE TO JON YUSPA,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3825-S3826] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JON YUSPA Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate a Nevadan who has gone above and beyond in his endeavors for our veteran community, Jon Yuspa. Jon formed and continues to lead Honor Flight Nevada, a nonprofit organization committed to honoring the brave men and women who so valiantly defended our freedom. In 2011, Jon formed Honor Flight Nevada to honor Nevada's World War II veterans and transport them to Washington, DC, to visit the memorials dedicated to honor their service and sacrifices. Since its formation, Honor Flight Nevada has expanded its trips to include Korean and Vietnam veteran visits. Over the past 5 years, Jon and the Honor Flight Nevada team have raised over $500,000 to transport more than 200 U.S. veterans to Washington, DC. The trips are completely funded and paid for at no cost to the veterans through private donations to Honor Flight Nevada. From the National World War II Memorial, to the Korean War Veterans Memorial, to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, all the way to Arlington National Cemetery, every veteran has the chance to see the memorials that stand as a testimony to the great sacrifices they have made. Even more remarkable, Honor Flight Nevada is the only Honor Flight organization to offer trips specifically for Vietnam veterans to visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. To witness these veterans honor their lost comrades at their memorials is truly a special experience. During the trip, veterans are showered with gratitude and applause in airports, on bus rides, at hotels, and en route to their memorials, all executed through the coordination and planning from the Honor Flight Nevada team. I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to everyone working on behalf of our veterans with Honor Flight Nevada, including those with Southwest Airlines and the Reno-Tahoe International Airport who have contributed so much to this organization. It is through the hard work and collaboration of this entire team that these trips are possible. Recently, Jon's work has been acknowledged with two prestigious awards. In April, Jon received the President's Award from Southwest Airlines, as well as the 2016 Jefferson Award for Nevada from the Jefferson Awards Foundation. These accolades are a tremendous honor, and without a doubt, Jon's work warrants this and so much more in recognition. I have personally attended a veterans send-off at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport [[Page S3826]] and have also met our heroes in our Nation's Capital as they observed the World War II Memorial and Arlington National Cemetery. I can attest to the positive impact that accompanies their journey. This truly is a life-changing experience for those who deserve only the greatest gratitude for their service. I most recently had the opportunity to see Jon's work firsthand in May at the internment of Bob Wheeler at Arlington National Cemetery. Bob was an important member of the Nevada family and will never be forgotten. Jon's work in bringing some of the Nevada family to honor Bob's sacrifice was admirable. No words can adequately thank Jon for all that he has done. Jon has truly impacted the lives of heroes across the State of Nevada. Today I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in congratulating Jon on his achievements and in recognizing the entire Honor Flight Nevada family for their work. Honor Flight Nevada's mission is noble, and I thank everyone for their commitment and compassion to Nevada's veterans. I wish Jon and all of the Honor Flight Nevada team the best of luck in their future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S3825-S3826] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JON YUSPA Mr. HELLER.

Mr. President, known as the ``Sportsman's Paradise,'' Louisiana is blessed with an abundance of natural resources, and millions of folks come from across the country and the world to see our unique ecosystems in person. The tourism industry plays a major role in our State's economy, bringing in billions of dollars each year. Much of that positive growth is due to our local small businesses, including this week's Small Business of the Week, Annie Miller's Son's Swamp & Marsh Tour of Houma, LA. Annie and Eddie Miller founded Annie Miller's Swamp and Marsh Tours in 1979, which became Louisiana's very first swamp-boat company. Known as Alligator Annie, Annie and Eddie escorted tourists through the Louisiana swamps, showing them everything from the beautiful marshlands to backwater canals and even allowing guests to feed wild alligators. Annie took her role as Louisiana's trailblazer of nature-based tourism very seriously and made sure each guest was well-educated in the effects of coastal erosion by the time the tour had concluded. Her efforts over the years led to the local government preserving sections of the marsh and bayous in Terrebonne Parish for the local alligators. Over the years, Annie Miller's Swamp and Marsh Tours experienced major successes, and it wasn't long before Annie and Eddie's son Jimmy Bonvillain joined the family business. Upon Annie's passing in 2004, Jimmy renamed the family business to Annie Miller's Son's Swamp & Marsh Tour and continues to welcome visitors year-round. Louisiana's small businesses in the tourism industry are constantly finding new and entertaining ways to attract visitors to our State. With its focus on both the beauty and importance of preserving our wildlife and natural resources, Annie Miller's Son's Swamp & Marsh Tour certainly found its successful hook decades ago. Congratulations to Annie Miller's Son's Swamp & Marsh Tour for being selected as this week's Small Business of the Week. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S3826] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING ANNIE MILLER'S SON'S SWAMP & MARSH TOUR Mr. VITTER.

Known as Alligator Annie, Annie and Eddie escorted tourists through the Louisiana swamps, showing them everything from the beautiful marshlands to backwater canals and even allowing guests to feed wild alligators. Annie took her role as Louisiana's trailblazer of nature-based tourism very seriously and made sure each guest was well-educated in the effects of coastal erosion by the time the tour had concluded. Her efforts over the years led to the local government preserving sections of the marsh and bayous in Terrebonne Parish for the local alligators. Over the years, Annie Miller's Swamp and Marsh Tours experienced major successes, and it wasn't long before Annie and Eddie's son Jimmy Bonvillain joined the family business. Upon Annie's passing in 2004, Jimmy renamed the family business to Annie Miller's Son's Swamp & Marsh Tour and continues to welcome visitors year-round. Louisiana's small businesses in the tourism industry are constantly finding new and entertaining ways to attract visitors to our State. With its focus on both the beauty and importance of preserving our wildlife and natural resources, Annie Miller's Son's Swamp & Marsh Tour certainly found its successful hook decades ago. Congratulations to Annie Miller's Son's Swamp & Marsh Tour for being selected as this week's Small Business of the Week. ____________________",package_114_183.csv,2232,2232,2298,"[congressional record volume 162, number 93 (monday, june 13, 2016)] [senate] [page s3826] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] recognizing annie miller's son's swamp & marsh tour mr. vitter. mr. president, known as the ``sportsman's paradise,'' louisiana is blessed with an abundance of natural resources, and millions of folks come from across the country and the world to see our unique ecosystems in person. the tourism industry plays a major role in our state's economy, bringing in billions of dollars each year. much of that positive growth is due to our local small businesses, including this week's small business of the week, annie miller's son's swamp & marsh tour of houma, la. annie and eddie miller founded annie miller's swamp and marsh tours in 1979, which became louisiana's very first swamp-boat company. known as alligator annie, annie and eddie escorted tourists through the louisiana swamps, showing them everything from the beautiful marshlands to backwater canals and even allowing guests to feed wild alligators. annie took her role as louisiana's trailblazer of nature-based tourism very seriously and made sure each guest was well-educated in the effects of coastal erosion by the time the tour had concluded. her efforts over the years led to the local government preserving sections of the marsh and bayous in terrebonne parish for the local alligators. over the years, annie miller's swamp and marsh tours experienced major successes, and it wasn't long before annie and eddie's son jimmy bonvillain joined the family business. upon annie's passing in 2004, jimmy renamed the family business to annie miller's son's swamp & marsh tour and continues to welcome visitors year-round. louisiana's small businesses in the tourism industry are constantly finding new and entertaining ways to attract visitors to our state. with its focus on both the beauty and importance of preserving our wildlife and natural resources, annie miller's son's swamp & marsh tour certainly found its successful hook decades ago. congratulations to annie miller's son's swamp & marsh tour for being selected as this week's small business of the week. ____________________",2232

MATT SALMON of arizona in the house of representatives Thursday, June 9, 2016 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5278) to establish an Oversight Board to assist the Government of Puerto Rico, including instrumentalities, in managing its public finances, and for other purposes: Mr. SALMON. Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak to an action taken by the Puerto Rican Secretary of Health who issued Administrative Order No. 346 on February 9, 2016. This Order is noteworthy in that it was issued without the benefit of review by Puerto Rico's legislature, and without any prior notice or comment period afforded to impacted parties that typically accompanies the publication of such Orders. Order No. 346 imposes an unprecedented set of regulatory requirements and fees on the nutritional dietary supplement industry that will invariably increase the cost to consumers who rely upon nutritional supplements as an adjunct to their normal diet. This Order creates significant economic barriers to acquiring nutritional supplements that have been widely accepted by consumers as a way of maintaining healthy lifestyles and preventing adverse health events in their lives. The Congress has recognized the importance of encouraging American adults to maintain minimum average daily intake of a variety of nutrients that are essential to maintaining health and well-being. The U.S. government has encouraged and funded a broad range of consumer education initiatives across the spectrum of public health agencies in the federal government with the goal of providing consumers with valuable information about the importance of the minimum daily nutritional intake standards required to maintain good health. Nutrition experts at the Harvard School of Public Health have emphasized the importance of a food pyramid that recommends a ``daily multivitamin plus extra vitamin D (for most people).'' Researchers at Tufts University have designed a specific food guide for the elderly that features the benefits of daily supplements of calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B-12 that are needed for optimal health. The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has issued a policy statement that emphasizes the importance of good food choices, and it also recognizes that nutritional supplements can help some people meet their daily nutritional needs. Supplements should be seen as one component of the search for a healthier lifestyle, including improvements in overall food habits and engaging in physical exercise. Much of the current research on nutrition and health focuses on prevention of chronic disease, but the primary reason most people use multivitamins and other nutritional supplements is to support overall wellness. I was astounding to me to find out about Order No. 346 issued by the Puerto Rican Secretary of Health that imposes a set of onerous market access fees in Puerto Rico for nutritional supplements, including a $25 fee on retailers and distributors for every variation of the supplement by size, flavor, and stock keeping unit (``SKU''). But the ``money grab'' did not stop there. Manufacturers must file an application and pay an additional $500 fee every 2 years for products that they intend to sell in Puerto Rico. Wholesale and Retail distributors must also register and pay an additional $100 fee every 2 years. Facilities are subject to inspection, and must pay a $50 fee every 2 years. In addition, Order No. 346 also imposes an additional significant administrative burden by requiring quality control data, Certificates of Analysis, the process used to obtain the product, label samples, promotional materials, Advertisements, Laboratory Certificates, and any and all warning statements which the FDA does not require of retailers of any regulated goods, which includes foods, drugs, and devices. These requirements are transparently only justifications for the imposition of this new regimen of fees. This onerous new fee structure may have the unintended consequence of usurping the role of the FDA in regulating the introduction of nutritional supplements into commerce as this Congress has determined by statute to be sufficient. There has not been any significant incident in Puerto Rico where a nutritional supplement manufacturer has introduced a tainted product to consumers. Nor is there any record of any significant number of adverse events attributable to the sale of nutritional supplements to Puerto Rican consumers. Furthermore, there are no reports of abusive commercial activities by nutritional supplement retailers in Puerto Rico. Finally, there are no unique public health concerns or issues attributable to nutritional supplement manufacturing or sales to consumers in Puerto Rico that have not been fully and adequately addressed by the FDA. Federal public health agencies, research organizations, and non- government organizations widely encourage the use of nutritional supplements to maintain minimum dietary intake, particularly for at- risk populations like the elderly and low-income families. Intuitively, one would think that the Public Health Agency responsible for the promotion of health and well-being of the people of Puerto Rico would be tearing down any barrier that exists for its people to access nutritional foods and supplements that promote the health and well-being of families. But the reality is, and it is a conundrum that is well known to this body, is that Puerto Rico is in the midst of a serious financial crisis for which it is seeking relief. As I understand it, Order No. 346 is a transparent and perverse way for the Puerto Rican government to generate revenue. I cannot help but remember the lyrics of a favorite song of mine sung by country music star Waylon Jennings, ``Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places.'' Is it not wrong to be looking for new revenue by increasing the costs to Puerto Rican families for nutritional supplements that assist them in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and thereby help them avoid adverse and costly health events that would incur potentially avoidable costs both to patients and government health care programs? Is it not wrong for the Secretary of Health to impose a back-door tax on nutritional supplements without the benefit of a statute authorizing these fees enacted by the Puerto Rican legislature? Is it not wrong to single out one industry, particularly an industry whose products support a public policy to promote the health and well- being of its citizens--particularly the elderly and children? How can the Puerto Rican government come to this Congress and expect to be taken seriously in their request for fiscal relief from their current debt burden when they are continuing to enact policies like Order No. 346 that are so grossly counterintuitive to good government policy? My colleague, Mr. Zinke, has authored a legislative remedy that will nullify Puerto Rico Administrative Order No. 346. I fully support this legislative effort that will protect the people of Puerto Rico from arbitrary and onerous restrictions on their access to nutritional supplement products, and threatens to damage the economic growth of the economy in Puerto Rico. If Administrative Order No. 346 is allowed to stand, the cumulative effect of a new layer of bureaucratic ``red tape'' and the unjustified imposition of regulatory fees will make Puerto Rico the costliest place to do business by natural products retailers anywhere in the United States or its territories. Low income consumers will likely be forced away from legitimate retailers on the Island and seek access to reasonably priced products on the Internet. The problem with that strategy is that the Internet is well known as a haven for counterfeit products and fly-by-night suppliers who regularly avoid the scrutiny of the FDA and failed to maintain good manufacturing practices for the production of its products. The perverse outcome of Administrative Order No. 346 is that it will actually increase the threat to public health among the citizens of Puerto Rico. An equally perverse outcome of Administrative Order No. 346 is that many Puerto Rican families will be unable to afford the increase in prices on nutritional supplements that they rely [[Page E890]] upon, and they will likely forgo those expenditures. Low income families will be hit the hardest as they are less likely to get nutrition they need from food alone, and nutritional supplements our key part of their maintaining the health and well-being. And I would ask my colleagues to consider this: Administrative Order No. 346, if it is allowed to stand, sets a dangerous precedent for every legitimate business operating in Puerto Rico today. If the Congress fails to nullify this order, nothing will stand in the way of the Government of Puerto Rico from imposing similar regulatory regimens on every other industry on the Island, without any notice or debate, and it will become the incubator for this terrible policy to migrate to other states and territories who are looking to enhance revenues. Much of what we do here in the Congress is to establish public policies to protect consumers from exploitive and predatory actions of unscrupulous manufacturers of products that economically harm our citizens. We are confronted today by a desperate Puerto Rican Government who appears to have set aside its duty to responsibly enact public policies that are consistent with the regular order of commerce, particularly as it relates to nutritional supplements, and has embarked on a clearly exploitive and predatory path to fleece nutritional supplement manufacturers and penalize its own consumers in the process. The Congress is now required to act to defend its own authority and regulatory framework for nutritional supplement products as administered by the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of Justice. We must act in order to prevent this exploitive and predatory action by the Puerto Rican Government that will have the inevitable consequence of harming its own citizens. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E889-E890] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PUERTO RICO OVERSIGHT, MANAGEMENT, AND ECONOMIC STABILITY ACT ______ speech of HON.

Nutrition experts at the Harvard School of Public Health have emphasized the importance of a food pyramid that recommends a ``daily multivitamin plus extra vitamin D (for most people).'' Researchers at Tufts University have designed a specific food guide for the elderly that features the benefits of daily supplements of calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B-12 that are needed for optimal health. The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has issued a policy statement that emphasizes the importance of good food choices, and it also recognizes that nutritional supplements can help some people meet their daily nutritional needs. Supplements should be seen as one component of the search for a healthier lifestyle, including improvements in overall food habits and engaging in physical exercise. Much of the current research on nutrition and health focuses on prevention of chronic disease, but the primary reason most people use multivitamins and other nutritional supplements is to support overall wellness. I was astounding to me to find out about Order No. 346 issued by the Puerto Rican Secretary of Health that imposes a set of onerous market access fees in Puerto Rico for nutritional supplements, including a $25 fee on retailers and distributors for every variation of the supplement by size, flavor, and stock keeping unit (``SKU''). But the ``money grab'' did not stop there. Manufacturers must file an application and pay an additional $500 fee every 2 years for products that they intend to sell in Puerto Rico. Wholesale and Retail distributors must also register and pay an additional $100 fee every 2 years. Facilities are subject to inspection, and must pay a $50 fee every 2 years. In addition, Order No. 346 also imposes an additional significant administrative burden by requiring quality control data, Certificates of Analysis, the process used to obtain the product, label samples, promotional materials, Advertisements, Laboratory Certificates, and any and all warning statements which the FDA does not require of retailers of any regulated goods, which includes foods, drugs, and devices. These requirements are transparently only justifications for the imposition of this new regimen of fees. This onerous new fee structure may have the unintended consequence of usurping the role of the FDA in regulating the introduction of nutritional supplements into commerce as this Congress has determined by statute to be sufficient. There has not been any significant incident in Puerto Rico where a nutritional supplement manufacturer has introduced a tainted product to consumers. Nor is there any record of any significant number of adverse events attributable to the sale of nutritional supplements to Puerto Rican consumers. Furthermore, there are no reports of abusive commercial activities by nutritional supplement retailers in Puerto Rico. Finally, there are no unique public health concerns or issues attributable to nutritional supplement manufacturing or sales to consumers in Puerto Rico that have not been fully and adequately addressed by the FDA. Federal public health agencies, research organizations, and non- government organizations widely encourage the use of nutritional supplements to maintain minimum dietary intake, particularly for at- risk populations like the elderly and low-income families. Intuitively, one would think that the Public Health Agency responsible for the promotion of health and well-being of the people of Puerto Rico would be tearing down any barrier that exists for its people to access nutritional foods and supplements that promote the health and well-being of families. But the reality is, and it is a conundrum that is well known to this body, is that Puerto Rico is in the midst of a serious financial crisis for which it is seeking relief. As I understand it, Order No. 346 is a transparent and perverse way for the Puerto Rican government to generate revenue. I cannot help but remember the lyrics of a favorite song of mine sung by country music star Waylon Jennings, ``Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places.'' Is it not wrong to be looking for new revenue by increasing the costs to Puerto Rican families for nutritional supplements that assist them in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and thereby help them avoid adverse and costly health events that would incur potentially avoidable costs both to patients and government health care programs? Is it not wrong for the Secretary of Health to impose a back-door tax on nutritional supplements without the benefit of a statute authorizing these fees enacted by the Puerto Rican legislature? Is it not wrong to single out one industry, particularly an industry whose products support a public policy to promote the health and well- being of its citizens--particularly the elderly and children? How can the Puerto Rican government come to this Congress and expect to be taken seriously in their request for fiscal relief from their current debt burden when they are continuing to enact policies like Order No. 346 that are so grossly counterintuitive to good government policy? My colleague, Mr. Zinke, has authored a legislative remedy that will nullify Puerto Rico Administrative Order No. 346. I fully support this legislative effort that will protect the people of Puerto Rico from arbitrary and onerous restrictions on their access to nutritional supplement products, and threatens to damage the economic growth of the economy in Puerto Rico. If Administrative Order No. 346 is allowed to stand, the cumulative effect of a new layer of bureaucratic ``red tape'' and the unjustified imposition of regulatory fees will make Puerto Rico the costliest place to do business by natural products retailers anywhere in the United States or its territories. Low income consumers will likely be forced away from legitimate retailers on the Island and seek access to reasonably priced products on the Internet. The problem with that strategy is that the Internet is well known as a haven for counterfeit products and fly-by-night suppliers who regularly avoid the scrutiny of the FDA and failed to maintain good manufacturing practices for the production of its products. The perverse outcome of Administrative Order No. 346 is that it will actually increase the threat to public health among the citizens of Puerto Rico. An equally perverse outcome of Administrative Order No. 346 is that many Puerto Rican families will be unable to afford the increase in prices on nutritional supplements that they rely [[Page E890]] upon, and they will likely forgo those expenditures. Low income families will be hit the hardest as they are less likely to get nutrition they need from food alone, and nutritional supplements our key part of their maintaining the health and well-being. And I would ask my colleagues to consider this: Administrative Order No. 346, if it is allowed to stand, sets a dangerous precedent for every legitimate business operating in Puerto Rico today. If the Congress fails to nullify this order, nothing will stand in the way of the Government of Puerto Rico from imposing similar regulatory regimens on every other industry on the Island, without any notice or debate, and it will become the incubator for this terrible policy to migrate to other states and territories who are looking to enhance revenues. Much of what we do here in the Congress is to establish public policies to protect consumers from exploitive and predatory actions of unscrupulous manufacturers of products that economically harm our citizens. We are confronted today by a desperate Puerto Rican Government who appears to have set aside its duty to responsibly enact public policies that are consistent with the regular order of commerce, particularly as it relates to nutritional supplements, and has embarked on a clearly exploitive and predatory path to fleece nutritional supplement manufacturers and penalize its own consumers in the process. The Congress is now required to act to defend its own authority and regulatory framework for nutritional supplement products as administered by the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of Justice. We must act in order to prevent this exploitive and predatory action by the Puerto Rican Government that will have the inevitable consequence of harming its own citizens. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E889-E890] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PUERTO RICO OVERSIGHT, MANAGEMENT, AND ECONOMIC STABILITY ACT ______ speech of HON.

CEDRIC L. RICHMOND of louisiana in the house of representatives Monday, June 13, 2016 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Officer Natasha Hunter, a 12-year veteran of the New Orleans Police Department. Officer Hunter embodied every quality you could dream of in a public servant. To her, being a police officer was more than just a job. It was an opportunity to help people when they had a problem, console them through a tough time, and inspire them to be something greater than they ever thought they could be. Impactful police work is more than protecting and serving. It is becoming part of the fabric of the community, and few officers are as deeply woven into the city of New Orleans as Officer Hunter. She was a hero, taken from us and her family far too early by an avoidable tragedy. On June 5, 2016 Officer Hunter sustained grave injuries from being struck by a drunk driver while in her police unit. Two days later on June 7, she succumbed to her injuries and passed away. This loss hits especially hard because a 5-year old girl has just lost her mother. A mother that loved her, provided for her, and did her best to make the community she grew up in safe. I share in the pain that the city has endured since her passing and I will always remember Officer Hunter's gallant sacrifice and unconquerable dedication every time she put on her uniform. My deepest condolences and prayers are with Officer Hunter's family, her fellow officers, but especially her young daughter Jasmine. Your mother will always protect you as she has protected all of us her entire career. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E890] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING NOPD OFFICER NATASHA HUNTER ______ HON.

It was an opportunity to help people when they had a problem, console them through a tough time, and inspire them to be something greater than they ever thought they could be. Impactful police work is more than protecting and serving. It is becoming part of the fabric of the community, and few officers are as deeply woven into the city of New Orleans as Officer Hunter. She was a hero, taken from us and her family far too early by an avoidable tragedy. On June 5, 2016 Officer Hunter sustained grave injuries from being struck by a drunk driver while in her police unit. Two days later on June 7, she succumbed to her injuries and passed away. This loss hits especially hard because a 5-year old girl has just lost her mother. A mother that loved her, provided for her, and did her best to make the community she grew up in safe. I share in the pain that the city has endured since her passing and I will always remember Officer Hunter's gallant sacrifice and unconquerable dedication every time she put on her uniform. My deepest condolences and prayers are with Officer Hunter's family, her fellow officers, but especially her young daughter Jasmine. Your mother will always protect you as she has protected all of us her entire career. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E890] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING NOPD OFFICER NATASHA HUNTER ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to seek to honor the life of Carl E. Fitchett, Jr., who passed away May 29, 2016 in Smithfield, North Carolina at the age of 93. Mr. Fitchett had a fierce passion for serving his community, as made apparent through his past roles as director of the N.C. Oil Jobbers Association, president of the Dunn Chamber of Commerce, and Commander of the American Legion. He also served as president of the Dunn Rotary Club which awarded him the Man of the Year award in 1958, and was a deacon, elder, and trustee at First Presbyterian Church of Dunn. In addition to his volunteer leadership roles in the Dunn community, Carl served in World War II and owned and operated Fitchett Oil Co., retiring in 1991. Mr. Fitchett is survived by his wife, Vivian; two children, Carl and Vivian; and four grandchildren, Duncan, Margaret, Austin and Katherine. Carl Fitchett, like so many of our community leaders, sacrificed time to better the lives of those around him. He spent his entire life helping those in Harnett County, and we are forever indebted to him for his dedication in serving the local community, especially his hometown of Dunn.

TERRI A. SEWELL of alabama in the house of representatives Monday, June 13, 2016 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, in light of the myriad of issues facing Americans living in poverty, I am disappointed that my Republican colleagues chose a drug treatment center as the location to unveil their anti-poverty proposal last week. Assuming the poor are more prone to impulsivity and addiction ignores the reality that poverty is often the result of a constellation of compounding difficulties that are exacerbated by poor access to healthcare and our nation's historic dis-investment in public health. Today, I am here to highlight the impact these complications have on my most vulnerable constituents and the role we all play in addressing them. The harsh disparities faced by my constituents in Alabama's Black Belt intersect at the nexus of poverty, demographics, and geographic access. Women in certain parts of my district have to drive to distant counties, sometimes two hours, to give birth to their babies. Folks in Choctaw County, Alabama have to travel over 100 miles to the closest full-service urban hospital or to see a specialist. In 6 of the 14 counties I represent, there are fewer than 5 primary care physicians, county-wide. The prostate cancer death rate in Alabama for black men was triple that of white men from 2000 to 2010. For all cancers, the mortality rate among blacks was more than double that of the white population during the same time period. There are many settings that would have better told the story of struggling Americans than an addiction treatment center. An emergency room in a rural hospital in my district would have been a great place to start. In this setting, the group would meet the working Alabamians who fall into our state's Medicaid gap. With the lowest Medicaid eligibility cap in the country, the working poor are left with no option for affordable health coverage. Because of financial constraints, these individuals ignore small health care concerns until they compound to make for an emergency situation, which can only be addressed in the expensive setting of an emergency room. There [[Page E891]] are many who leave the emergency room less able to work and provide for their families because of the long-term impact of allowing untreated health issues to compound. In addition to severe access issues, generations of men and women in Alabama's 7th District have been negatively impacted by the tortured legacy of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. While I applaud decisions to provide medical benefits to the family members infected, and the apology issued by President Clinton in 1997, these actions only began to address the damage this 40 year experiment had on our most vulnerable communities. There are decades of research that show that minorities often do not seek treatment for conditions because of distrust of health care providers regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. The mistrust the Tuskegee study generated interferes with attempts to combat HIV/ AIDS, sickle cell anemia, uterine fibroids, prostate cancer and a myriad of other conditions that disproportionately impact minority groups. If we are serious about addressing health disparities in rural and underserved communities, we must start by working to restore the faith all of our constituents have in the medical establishment, particularly public health programs, vaccinations, and clinical trials. We should view this as an issue needing as much intervention as drug abuse and inner-city violence. I was sent to Congress by one of the most underserved constituencies in the country to build upon programs that work and craft new proposals to reverse this cursed course. I look forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen the Medicare and Medicaid programs, invest in health education and medical research, and incentivize providers to practice in rural and underserved communities. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E890-E891] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NEED TO ELIMINATE HEALTH DISPARITIES IN RURAL AND UNDERSERVED MINORITY COMMUNITIES ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on Blue Monday, to bring awareness to the health issues faced by men across the country. The importance of striving for a healthy society is something we can all agree on. Despite the fact that one in seven men will be affected by prostate cancer, men's health doesn't always receive the attention it deserves. Men are more at risk for heart disease, cancer, diabetes, depression, and many more illnesses, yet nearly one in ten have not seen a physician in more than five years, and as many as 70 percent have waist sizes exceeding healthy standards. These issues affect not only men, but our whole families, and we should all work together toward healthier lifestyles. I would like to recognize the efforts of the Men's Health Foundation in Southeast Michigan in helping men take steps to better health. Blue Monday kicks off International Men's Health Week which provides important educational opportunities to increase awareness for detection and prevention of the diseases that kill millions of our fathers, husbands, brothers, and sons each year. I would encourage all men to celebrate Blue Monday by getting screened, exercising, and eating right to help reduce the risk of prostate cancer and other diseases. I would like to give a special thanks to Dr. Michael Lutz for his efforts to address men's health issues in our community and wish everyone a happy Blue Monday. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E891] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING BLUE MONDAY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF MEN'S HEALTH ______ HON.

BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Monday, June 13, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable public servant, Mrs. Edna Beverly. Mrs. Beverly was born on a plantation in Sidon, Mississippi to the late Roosevelt and Betsy Oliver. Mrs. Beverly had to go to the field with her grandparents (the late Albert and Emma Oliver) and parents, where they were sharecroppers earning $5 a week. She had to stay near the water truck because she was young. She would not be afraid because she could see and hear them singing spirituals, until they were out of site. She would then be there alone for hours until they returned. Her parents and grandparents encouraged her to do and be the best that she could be. Mrs. Beverly attended elementary school on the plantation at St. John Baptist Church Elementary. The school consisted of only one classroom. Her family decided to relocate to Chicago, Illinois when she was only 12 years old. Mrs. Beverly attended Marshall High School and Taylor Business Institute in Chicago, where she graduated with honors receiving a degree in Computerized Accounting. She accepted her call to the Ministry in 1991, obtained her license in 1995 and was ordained in 1996. Mrs. Beverly worked with the youth department, teaching Sunday School, Bible Study, and spiritual songs for many years. She later moved to Ruleville, Mississippi in 2001, and married Mr. Marvin Beverly, who was a school teacher at Ruleville Central High School. They were happily married until his death in 2005. She worked for several years as a remedial reading tutor at Ruleville Central Elementary School serving 437 students. Mrs. Beverly has received several awards: a Certificate of Appreciation from Governor Haley Barbour; AmeriCorp Leadership Community Service; and Congressional Community Service. She became the first black City Clerk/Tax Collector for the City of Ruleville in 2005. Mrs. Beverly's greatest passion is her Ministry and her love for children. She is currently serving as Sunday School Superintendent, and assisting her Pastor, Rev. Claude Raine, at Mallalieu United Methodist Church in Ruleville. Mrs. Beverly is the proud mother of four wonderful children, the grandmother of ten amazing grandchildren, and the great grandmother of one. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mrs. Edna Beverly for her dedication to serving others and giving back to the African American community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E891] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING EDNA BEVERLY ______ HON.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Ketner family as they mourn the loss of this great man. Never one to shy away from a challenge, Mr. Ketner learned early on the value of a hard day's work, receiving a single penny for each chicken he plucked at his family's house. While it was far from glorious work, that never bothered Mr. Ketner and he used the lessons from those early days to launch one of the most successful grocery store chains in the country. In 1957, Ralph Ketner opened the first Food Town store in Salisbury, North Carolina. When the store initially opened, it struggled to differentiate itself from the competition [[Page E892]] until he took a major risk and began an aggressive price cutting program. However, the risk paid off and the results were revolutionary. With the rallying cry of ``Lowest Food Prices in North Carolina,'' Mr. Ketner went from having one store to owning one of the largest grocery franchises. Even though his professional accomplishments are outstanding, Mr. Ketner's proudest achievements came in what he was able to give back to the community through his many philanthropic works. During his lifetime, he never forgot to thank those that made it all possible and helped whenever he could. After the success of Food Lion, Mr. Ketner donated millions of dollars to support various education projects including the development of the business school at Catawba College which now proudly bears his name. Ralph Ketner was a remarkable man known for his dedication, passion, and kindness. You would be hard pressed to find anyone who does not speak of him with the utmost respect and admiration. I will always cherish the time I spent with Mr. Ketner. I will never forget his friendship, humor, and sound advice. While we mourn the loss of Mr. Ketner, there is no doubt that his legacy will live on through not only his professional success but also the countless lives he was able to touch.

Martin Grocer Penny Store has been a thriving force in Vicksburg, MS for nearly fifty years. Martin Grocer Penny Store was a single-room grocery attached to Ms. Exelena Martin's home. The store remains mostly in its original condition. The loud clank of the cowbell alerted Ms. Martin when she had customers. The ceiling slants at a steep pitch and is less than 6 feet high at the northern wall. Two bare light bulbs provided all the light shoppers needed in the full service store which had no particular hours. The 83-year-old Exelena Martin decided it was time to retire in November 2015. Martin's is an example of a small business weathering the test of time.

The store remains mostly in its original condition. The loud clank of the cowbell alerted Ms. Martin when she had customers. The ceiling slants at a steep pitch and is less than 6 feet high at the northern wall. Two bare light bulbs provided all the light shoppers needed in the full service store which had no particular hours. The 83-year-old Exelena Martin decided it was time to retire in November 2015. Martin's is an example of a small business weathering the test of time. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Martin Grocer Penny Store for its longevity and dedication to serving Vicksburg, MS. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E892] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MARTIN GROCER PENNY STORE ______ HON.

ALCEE L. HASTINGS of florida in the house of representatives Monday, June 13, 2016 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest and most prestigious award in the Girl Scouts organization, which has produced one million young women as leaders and change agents in their communities. Since 1916, this award has honored high school-aged Girl Scouts who answer the call to ``Go Gold'' and put in years of research and hard work to facilitate large-scale community service projects. The impact these young women are having on the world around them far exceeds their average age of 17 years old. As the Girl Scouts' highest achievement, Gold Award recipients who enlist in the U.S. armed forces may enter at one rank higher than other recruits. Universities and colleges around the country also offer scholarships to young women who receive this award. Sarah Banach, of Enfield, Connecticut, created and implemented coding lesson plans for young women at her local middle school to help bridge the gender gap in STEM-related fields. Loren McClendon, of Jacksonville, Fla., trained almost 500 adults in her community on how to recognize warning signs of strokes. Kaitlin Greenough, of Zephyrhills, Fla., developed an entire curriculum to teach elementary school-aged children about the Florida water system and water conservation. These are just a few of the countless community service projects taken on by Girl Scouts from the illustrious ranks of Gold Award recipients. As an organization, the Girl Scouts have allowed millions of girls nationwide to become involved in their communities and take on leadership roles while building courage, confidence and critical life skills. There are currently 3 million Girls Scouts nationwide and 50 million alumnae, a testament to founder Juliette ``Daisy'' Gordon Low's original mission to empower girls with confidence, courage, and character. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pride to recognize this organization, particularly my local troop, the Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida, in Congress. I am inspired by what these esteemed Gold Award recipients have been able to accomplish in 100 years and look forward to seeing them succeed for many more years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E892] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD ______ HON.

CREC-2016-06-13-pt1-PgE892-4,CREC-2016-06-13,114,CELEBRATING THE HISTORY OF ST. LUCAS LUTHERAN CHURCH,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E892-E893] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE HISTORY OF ST. LUCAS LUTHERAN CHURCH ______ HON. MARCY KAPTUR of ohio in the house of representatives Monday, June 13, 2016 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize St. Lucas Lutheran Church in South Toledo. On Sunday, June 12, the church dedicated a state historic marker as part of its 130th anniversary celebration. The celebration began on Mothers Day 2016 with a concert featuring the Toledo Symphony's Brass Quintet. St. Lucas is a progressive Lutheran Church wrapping itself around its congregants in their faith journeys. It describes itself as ``a faith community of many ministries and many ministers. In all we do we strive to glorify Jesus Christ.'' The church began on March 21, 1886 when a group of people met in the home of Louis Burman to discuss the formation of a Lutheran church in Toledo's southern neighborhood to serve the Germans settling there. Though first meeting in borrowed space, by 1887 the congregation had its own church building and parsonage on Walbridge Avenue. With both German and English services, a Ladies Aid Society, Young People's Society and choir, the church was well established. Though these organizations were briefly disbanded, by 1897 they were a permanent part of the mission of St. Lucas. That same year, a monthly paper was published in coordination with two other congregations, with an eventual readership in 1200 homes. As it grew, the church outgrew its space and the last services in St. Lucas' first church building were held on May 8, 1910. The new building was a reflection of the church's origins as a German mission church and built in the Gothic revival style. During the 1911 dedication celebration of the new church building, the congregation received a German language Bible inscribed by Kaiser Wilhelm II. The dedication also saw the first English-speaking sermon, offered by Pastor Hugo Hamfeldt. Soon Sunday services were spoken in English. The church undertook renovations in 1931, 1945, 1961 and as part of its 1986 centennial celebration in order to ``enhance and update the [[Page E893]] worship atmosphere.'' In the 1960s as the ecumenism movement flourished, St. Lucas was a charter member of the Old South End's ecumenical organization known as CROSS (Christians Relating Our Savior on the South Side.) CROSS has engaged in exchanges in the pulpit, Thanksgiving Eve and Unity Good Friday services, Feed Your Neighbor food pantry and children's summer services. As the neighborhood changed, St. Lucas continued to adapt itself, ``taking risks for the sake of the Gospel.'' It now sits in the heart of a neighborhood with many challenges, yet the church soldiers on meeting the needs of its congregation and neighborhood through outreach. Now as it comes to its 130th anniversary, St Lucas Lutheran Church proudly dedicates a historic marker outlining the church's history in the neighborhood. A special feature of the dedication ceremony is the world premiere of a hymn which was commissioned especially for the 130th anniversary. With words and music by the parish's husband and wife team of Michael and Karen Biscay, Choirmaster Ron Lang conducts the St. Lucas Choir, accompanied by organist Jamie Dauel in the fast- ever performance of the anthem. At its 125th anniversary, the Biscays wrote a hymn in tribute to the congregation's German heritage and this work is also featured in Sunday's dedication ceremony. I was pleased to join the congregation and members of our community in celebrating this joyous occasion. St. Lucas Lutheran Church stands today in testament to the faith and perseverance of its members through the ages. Generations have worshiped together, prayed together, served together. Truly, it can be said of St. Lucas that its congregation has lived the Gospels and Christ's message as written in Matthew 12:30-31 to ``Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength . . . Love your neighbor as yourself.'' As the congregation of St. Lucas Lutheran Church continues on its faith journey, living the Gospel and sharing Christ's message of Love, it stands on a rich and deep history. The Ohio Historic Marker records that history as the church turns forward to a future strong in its faith. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E892-E893] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE HISTORY OF ST.

BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Monday, June 13, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable young entrepreneur and Mayor, Mayor Marcus Wallace of Edwards, Mississippi. Marcus L. Wallace was raised in Edwards, MS. He attended school in Edwards and graduated from Southern University, Baton Rouge, LA in 1992, with a B.S. in Marketing. He is a successful businessman, serving as President and CEO of MAC & Associates, LLC. Additionally, Mr. Wallace is President of the Wall Group, a Sports & Entertainment Firm. As a young entrepreneur who had a plan to become a general contractor, he has grown his company from $500 projects to multimillion dollar projects, consisting of constructions of virtually every kind. To further expand the scope of his company's services, Mr. Wallace established MAC & Associates, LLC, a division of MAC Construction Company. Mr. Wallace and the company's principals, collectively, have over 50 years of expertise in government, commercial, and private sector construction management. MAC Construction Company of Mississippi is licensed, bonded and insured. During the past 16 years, MAC has completed several projects throughout the state of Mississippi. It is one of the fastest growing minority owned construction firms in Mississippi. Mr. Wallace is the largest minority owner of the new Westin Hotel (under construction) in downtown Jackson and has ownership in the Iron Horse Grill. In addition to his Construction prowess, Mr. Wallace has been a Sports Agent for professional athletes in the NBA and NFL, managed recording artists in the music industry and promoted concerts and comedy shows, and has extensive experience in the communication and transportation industries. On December 8, 2014, Mr. Wallace was sworn in as Mayor of Edwards, MS. He hit the ground running even before his inauguration and hasn't slowed down. His inaugural decisions sent a strong message about his focus. Instead of hosting a celebratory event, he redirected the funds to help families in Edwards. He provided shoes for kids in Edwards and made Christmas special for children by delivering toys during the Christmas holidays. From those simple steps, his path has not wavered. His focus is on the citizens of Edwards, a town he acknowledges ``needs everything''. Mayor Wallace sees himself as ``front line soldier'' intent upon seeing that they get it. During Mayor Wallace's first year in office, the Town of Edwards has experienced a transformation unparalleled in its history. The following are major accomplishments during May for Mayor Wallace's tenure: The police department has received new police cars, new uniforms, a new police chief, and the establishment of a Crime Task Force. Crime is down by 60 percent. Edwards and Cal-Maine Foods partnership for infrastructure improvement: Cal-Maine provided financial assistance to Edwards for optioning the electrical easement that will serve power to their new pullet facility. Also, Cal-Maine hired a company to clear the roadside and repair the road from Highway 80 to the railroad. The partnership is valued at over $75,000, with a $10,000 cash contribution to the town. Amnesty Day: Over $200,000 was collected during Amnesty Day. Community Building and Livestock Building Demolition: Edwards received $150,000 from Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) and $80,000 from Block Grant Funds. New Legal Appointments: Mayor Wallace appointed a new legal team that consisted of Judge Frank Sutton as Edwards' new Municipal Judge, Mrs. Greta Mack-Harris as Municipal Prosecutor, and Mr. Omar Nelson as the town's attorney. Edwards received a $20,000 grant from MDOT to enhance the Edwards' exits on Interstate 20, east and west bound. Established the Mayor's Annual Town Clean-Up Day. Balanced the Town's budget. Mr. Wallace is a committed civic leader and strong supporter of communities throughout central Mississippi. He is a born leader, respected for both his character and work ethics. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mayor Marcus Wallace for his dedication to serving our great state of Mississippi. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E893] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MAYOR MARCUS WALLACE ______ HON.

OFFICE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E893-E894] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY ON THE GRAND OPENING OF THE FIU IN D.C. OFFICE ______ HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON of florida in the house of representatives Monday, June 13, 2016 Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Florida International University on the grand opening of the FIU In D.C. office located just steps from the U.S. Capitol. Since opening its doors in 1965, FIU has grown to become the number one university in awarding bachelor's and master's degrees to Hispanic and other minority students. With the new expansion, FIU has ensured that students seeking opportunities in our nation's capital have the resources they need to succeed. In the past five years, hundreds of FIU Panthers have come to D.C. as interns and fellows to work for non-profits, federal agencies [[Page E894]] and private firms. From the White House to the halls of Congress, FIU students have also been an integral part of the executive and legislative branches of government. As the faces of FIU in D.C., interns and fellows learn about federal policy and expand their professional network. I am sure that my colleagues agree when I say our congressional FIU interns are Worlds Ahead. Blocks away from Capitol Hill, FIU's new office will bring together ideas, connections and solutions through speaker series and research seminars.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Florida International University on the grand opening of the FIU In D.C. office located just steps from the U.S. Capitol. Since opening its doors in 1965, FIU has grown to become the number one university in awarding bachelor's and master's degrees to Hispanic and other minority students. With the new expansion, FIU has ensured that students seeking opportunities in our nation's capital have the resources they need to succeed. In the past five years, hundreds of FIU Panthers have come to D.C. as interns and fellows to work for non-profits, federal agencies [[Page E894]] and private firms. From the White House to the halls of Congress, FIU students have also been an integral part of the executive and legislative branches of government. As the faces of FIU in D.C., interns and fellows learn about federal policy and expand their professional network.

As 2016 marks the 20th anniversary of this important event, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Dean for his leadership and commitment in the community to raising awareness and vital funds in the fight against blood cancer. In 1997, in the aftermath of losing his son Bobby to leukemia at the age of 19, Mr. Dean set forth to honor his son's memory by founding an annual event that would unite adults, students, families, businesses, schools, and organizations from throughout the Sacramento region to partner with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society to raise funds for blood cancer research, and to provide patient services for those suffering from the disease. Over the past 20 years, the Man & Woman of the Year event has brought together hundreds of volunteers, many who themselves are cancer survivors, to work towards finding a cure. In great part due to Mr. Dean's dedication to this cause, nearly $5 million has been raised, which has helped to fund breakthrough research and lifesaving therapies that have dramatically increased survivorship in both adults and children. In taking a stand against blood cancer, Mr. Dean has continued to honor his son in the most meaningful way--by giving hope to others. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to Robert D. Dean, Founding Chair of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's Man & Woman of the Year campaign, as he celebrates the 20th anniversary of this important community event. I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring his exemplary volunteerism on behalf of cancer patients and families, as well as his ongoing dedication to the fight against blood cancer. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E894] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF ROBERT D.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the retirement of my good friends, Reverend Robert ``Bob'' Oshita and Reverend Patti Oshita, of the Buddhist Church of Sacramento Hongwanji Betsuin. As the community celebrates the departure of two excellent leaders, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring their remarkable contributions to the Buddhist Church of Sacramento and the greater Sacramento community. It is a great pleasure to recognize Reverend Bob and Reverend Patti, as Reverend Patti had served as Executive Assistant for my late husband, the Congressman Robert T. Matsui. Reverend Bob began ministering at the Buddhist Church of Sacramento in 1984 after completing both undergraduate and graduate degrees at the University of California, Berkeley and ministerial training in Kyoto, Japan. Two years later, Reverend Bob married Reverend Patti, who attended California State University, Sacramento and also studied in Japan for her ministerial ordination. Together, they have become an institution at the Buddhist Church of Sacramento. Reverend Bob was the 36th minister of the Buddhist Church of Sacramento, and has served the church for 32 years. Reverend Patti was an assistant minister of the church and taught Sunday Dharma School classes. Both have proved to be excellent community leaders, leading with humility and providing comfort and guidance for those in need. It is under the leadership of Reverend Bob and Reverend Patti that the membership of the Buddhist Church of Sacramento has grown to just under 1000 households. Through seeking out genuine human connections, Reverend Bob and Reverend Patti have promoted a more unified community, both within the Buddhist Church of Sacramento and beyond. The dedication Reverend Bob and Reverend Patti have demonstrated is exemplary and the wisdom they have spread in the Sacramento area is truly invaluable. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to exceptional community members Reverend Bob Oshita and Reverend Patti Oshita as they celebrate their service to the Buddhist Church of Sacramento and the Sacramento community. I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring their outstanding work and wishing them the best in retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E895] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF REVEREND ROBERT OSHITA AND REVEREND PATTI OSHITA ______ HON.

As avid tennis players with successful careers on and off the court, Dick and Liz 's passion for the game of tennis and community has resulted in a combined 40 years either playing the game, teaching the game, or giving back to their community through the game of tennis. It was this mutual love of tennis and community that led Dick and Liz to establish Blue Sky Foundation, Inc. in 2008. This non-profit charitable organization was originally established with the goals of raising funds for different children's charities in order to give them a hope for a better tomorrow through sporting event fund raisers. However, also seeking a way to pay tribute to past and current service members for their sacrifice to our country, Dick and Liz created the ``Boots on the Court Program'' which offers free tennis clinics from former tour players and certified teaching professionals to active service members, spouses, children, veterans, and wounded warriors. Since their first clinic in July of 2013, Boots on the Court has traveled to 12 different locations and put on more than 18 different events across the nation and touched countless numbers of lives. This month, on June 18th, Boots on the Court will be hosting their next event right here in Washington D.C. at Joint Base Andrews. Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage all military men and women in the area to attend this fantastic event and once again thank Dick and Liz Stockton and the staff at Blue Sky Foundation for their continued support of communities and military men and women across the nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E895] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BLUE SKY FOUNDATION--BOOTS ON THE COURT PROGRAM ______ HON.

PHIPPS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E896] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MRS. ORA B. PHIPPS ______ HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Monday, June 13, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Ora B. Phipps. Ora B. Peoples was born on October 21, 1928 to the late Rev. Claiborne and Elizabeth Peoples in Coahoma, MS. She was educated in her early years by the Coahoma County School system in a one room, one teacher, all black school. She attended Aggie High School and a college by Coahoma College. She grew up in a farming family. Often their school schedule was set around the farmers. Many students would drop out of school because work was more important than education. This stuck with her and later became very instrumental in shaping her and her family's life. She has 10 children (seven girls and 3 boys) which are the joy of her life. In 1951 she moved to Marks, MS where she later married Armstead Phipps. They were both concerned about education. Their children were some of the first to integrate Marks Jr. High School better known then as the white school or bulldog. Their children suffered the abuse and ridicule that came with the movement but as parents they were committed to see this process through. Armstead Phipps, husband, participated in the James Meredith March against Fear in 1966 in which he collapsed and died in the process of fighting for Civil Rights. He suffered a heart condition in which he was warned not to participate but he thought the cause was too important not to. He felt that his children would benefit from the integration of the school system. He said he would like to shake hands with Dr. Martin Luther King and Dick Gregory then everything would be alright. He asked his wife, Ora Phipps, to promise him that if anything happened that she would send their children to the white school. She kept that promise. At the time of his death a voter registration card was found in his wallet, which was one of his proudest achievements. His funeral was eulogized by the late Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the Valley Queen Church in Marks, MS. That voter registration card was shown to the congregation at the funeral by Dr. King. Ora B. Phipps was very instrumental in starting the first head start program in Marks, MS in the home of Mr. Brady on Martin Luther King Drive. They had no school buses to get the children to school. She and many other people solicited drivers, teachers, social workers, cooks, and everything necessary to start the program all by volunteers. The program then advanced to local churches in surrounding areas, finally the proposal to start and fund the program was submitted to the school board in Hotel Heidelberg at Jackson, MS. She was a visionary and a self-starter. Her hobbies consist of gardening where she spends countless hours in the yard. This is a community garden in her yard where she gives to anyone that asks. She is known by everyone in the community for her giving nature and love for the people. She still is an active member of the Church of Christ in Lambert, MS. Ora Phipps was honored in Birmingham, Alabama with the Southern Rural Black Women Initiative for Economic and Social Justice Award on March 6, 2010 for her brave efforts in fighting for social and economic justice. Mr. Speaker, please help us to congratulate Mrs. Ora B.

Ora B. Peoples was born on October 21, 1928 to the late Rev. Claiborne and Elizabeth Peoples in Coahoma, MS. She was educated in her early years by the Coahoma County School system in a one room, one teacher, all black school. She attended Aggie High School and a college by Coahoma College. She grew up in a farming family. Often their school schedule was set around the farmers. Many students would drop out of school because work was more important than education. This stuck with her and later became very instrumental in shaping her and her family's life. She has 10 children (seven girls and 3 boys) which are the joy of her life. In 1951 she moved to Marks, MS where she later married Armstead Phipps. They were both concerned about education. Their children were some of the first to integrate Marks Jr. High School better known then as the white school or bulldog. Their children suffered the abuse and ridicule that came with the movement but as parents they were committed to see this process through. Armstead Phipps, husband, participated in the James Meredith March against Fear in 1966 in which he collapsed and died in the process of fighting for Civil Rights. He suffered a heart condition in which he was warned not to participate but he thought the cause was too important not to. He felt that his children would benefit from the integration of the school system. He said he would like to shake hands with Dr. Martin Luther King and Dick Gregory then everything would be alright. He asked his wife, Ora Phipps, to promise him that if anything happened that she would send their children to the white school. She kept that promise. At the time of his death a voter registration card was found in his wallet, which was one of his proudest achievements. His funeral was eulogized by the late Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the Valley Queen Church in Marks, MS. That voter registration card was shown to the congregation at the funeral by Dr. King. Ora B. Phipps was very instrumental in starting the first head start program in Marks, MS in the home of Mr. Brady on Martin Luther King Drive. They had no school buses to get the children to school. She and many other people solicited drivers, teachers, social workers, cooks, and everything necessary to start the program all by volunteers. The program then advanced to local churches in surrounding areas, finally the proposal to start and fund the program was submitted to the school board in Hotel Heidelberg at Jackson, MS. She was a visionary and a self-starter. Her hobbies consist of gardening where she spends countless hours in the yard. This is a community garden in her yard where she gives to anyone that asks. She is known by everyone in the community for her giving nature and love for the people. She still is an active member of the Church of Christ in Lambert, MS. Ora Phipps was honored in Birmingham, Alabama with the Southern Rural Black Women Initiative for Economic and Social Justice Award on March 6, 2010 for her brave efforts in fighting for social and economic justice. Mr. Speaker, please help us to congratulate Mrs. Ora B. Phipps for her part in history. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E896] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MRS.

KEVIN BRADY of texas in the house of representatives Monday, June 13, 2016 ``If there be any truer measure of a man than by what he does, it must be by what he gives.'' Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the English clergyman Robert South never met Larry Domino, but his words sum up exactly how Larry's family, friends and extended family of former athletes view this remarkable man. Larry Domino wasn't born in Texas, but it seems he got to the Lone Star State as soon as he could. When Larry arrived from Depew, New York 35 years ago, he already had a heart as big as any native born son. After all, he is a diehard Buffalo Bills fan. He's also a born educator. Larry Domino first earned his place in education with a degree from Buffalo State College and then earned a Masters from Sam Houston State University. Over the past three and half decades, Larry has taught, coached and been a school administrator in both the Aldine and Klein districts. Currently, he is a beloved Associate Principal at Klein's Doerre Intermediate School. When Larry married the love of his life, Tina Lee, 27 years ago next month, his Texas sized heart expanded. Then it grew even bigger when they welcomed the lights of their lives--daughters, Brita Susan and Lauren Ansley in 1995 and 1998. Whether Larry Domino is known as teacher, dad, coach, or principal, generations of eager young people have achieved their dreams because Mr. D. believed in them. Chonda Besse says ``Mr D is a man of few words,'' but he taught her that ``sometimes a few words are all it takes to change someone's life.'' She is honored to be thought of as a ``daughter'' in the Domino family. One of his former swimmers at Eisenhower High School, Lisa Jost, remembers how Coach Domino told her ``that I could do anything I set my mind to doing, and that I could trust myself to do it well.'' She held on to that because ``it had to be true if Coach said it.'' She says as a new teacher, her coach is still inspiring her. Dr. Tina Elkins says what made Coach Domino different was that he coached them in and out of the water, providing a foundation that helped her become who she is today. It's not just students who were impressed either, Eisenhower Principal Fred Richardson notes Coach Domino's ``ability to develop relationships, with teachers, students and parents'' and the ``positive difference in the lives of many.'' As Buffalo Bills coach Mary Levy says ``Where else would you rather be than right here, right now?'' Coach Domino, you found your best right here in Texas. And Texas is better off for your service to generations of young people who just needed someone to believe in them. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E897] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF LARRY DOMINO ______ HON.

And Texas is better off for your service to generations of young people who just needed someone to believe in them. ____________________",package_114_183.csv,2916,2916,2982,"[congressional record volume 162, number 93 (monday, june 13, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e897] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] in recognition of larry domino ______ hon. kevin brady of texas in the house of representatives monday, june 13, 2016 ``if there be any truer measure of a man than by what he does, it must be by what he gives.'' mr. brady of texas. mr. speaker, the english clergyman robert south never met larry domino, but his words sum up exactly how larry's family, friends and extended family of former athletes view this remarkable man. larry domino wasn't born in texas, but it seems he got to the lone star state as soon as he could. when larry arrived from depew, new york 35 years ago, he already had a heart as big as any native born son. after all, he is a diehard buffalo bills fan. he's also a born educator. larry domino first earned his place in education with a degree from buffalo state college and then earned a masters from sam houston state university. over the past three and half decades, larry has taught, coached and been a school administrator in both the aldine and klein districts. currently, he is a beloved associate principal at klein's doerre intermediate school. when larry married the love of his life, tina lee, 27 years ago next month, his texas sized heart expanded. then it grew even bigger when they welcomed the lights of their lives--daughters, brita susan and lauren ansley in 1995 and 1998. whether larry domino is known as teacher, dad, coach, or principal, generations of eager young people have achieved their dreams because mr. d. believed in them. chonda besse says ``mr d is a man of few words,'' but he taught her that ``sometimes a few words are all it takes to change someone's life.'' she is honored to be thought of as a ``daughter'' in the domino family. one of his former swimmers at eisenhower high school, lisa jost, remembers how coach domino told her ``that i could do anything i set my mind to doing, and that i could trust myself to do it well.'' she held on to that because ``it had to be true if coach said it.'' she says as a new teacher, her coach is still inspiring her. dr. tina elkins says what made coach domino different was that he coached them in and out of the water, providing a foundation that helped her become who she is today. it's not just students who were impressed either, eisenhower principal fred richardson notes coach domino's ``ability to develop relationships, with teachers, students and parents'' and the ``positive difference in the lives of many.'' as buffalo bills coach mary levy says ``where else would you rather be than right here, right now?'' coach domino, you found your best right here in texas. and texas is better off for your service to generations of young people who just needed someone to believe in them. ____________________",2916

RICHARD JOHN TUSCANI ______ HON. LEE M. ZELDIN of new york in the house of representatives Monday, June 13, 2016 Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay a special tribute Mr. Richard John Tuscani. Richard was born on June 13, 1916 and is known to be the oldest living WWII veteran in Suffolk County, NY. Originally from Corona, Queens, Mr. Tuscani has managed to see and do more than most people could hope to accomplish in two lifetimes. Richard is a highly decorated WWII veteran, having served in New Guinea and the Philippines. During his time in the service, Mr. Tuscani received three Bronze Stars in addition to other awards such as the Victory Medal, the Philippines Presidential Unit Citation Badge and the Meritorious Service Award. The three Bronze Stars he received are for surviving a battle in Leyte, Philippines, another for surviving a kamikaze attack in New Guinea, and the last for the Philippines Liberation. Richard has also been extremely active in the community as well. During his historic lifetime, Richard was a fireman in New York City, oil truck driver, New York City building inspector, bus driver, local dock master, and school bus matron. His strong sense of civic duty and dedication to the community in the many professions he's undertaken exemplify just how incredible of a person he is. Richard, an avid history and geography buff, likes to spend most of his time reading, studying history, and watching his New York Yankees. His late wife, Helen, was crowned ``Miss Swift'' at the New York World's Fair in 1939. He has a son, Richard G, and a daughter, June, who was born while Mr. Tuscani was overseas. I would like to thank Richard, who will be turning 100 years old on June 13, 2016, for his years of dedication and service to our country and community. What he has managed to accomplish during his lifetime and give back to the country cannot be summarized in a few words; however it is important we honor these types of individuals as best we can. It is my hope that many will follow in his footsteps and give back to our country as graciously as he did.

Sean ran to the driver's door of the car to see if the driver was injured. When he saw flames underneath the vehicle, Sean decided it was time to act and he pulled the driver out of the car.

TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, June 13, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, June 12th marks an important date in United States policy. Twenty-nine years to the day, President Ronald Reagan traveled to Berlin to speak out against communism and call on the President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, to tear down the Berlin Wall. This would become known as his famous ``tear down this wall'' speech. The Berlin Wall grew in the aftermath of the Second World War. In 1945, the Allies split a defeated Germany into four allied occupation zones. The eastern part of the country went to the Soviet Union and the Western part of Germany went to the United States, Great Britain, and later France. Even though Berlin sat entirely in the Soviet territory, it too was divided into Eastern and Western occupation zones with the Soviets taking the East and the other allies taking the West part of the city. As Berlin was split apart, so too was the relationship between the democratic United States and communist Soviet Union. These stark differences in political ideologies led to extreme tension in that area, and around the world. So much so that the Soviet Union would often play the role of mischief maker in Germany. In 1948 the USSR began a blockade on West Berlin in the hopes of driving out the Western influences. However, due to the ingenious Berlin Airlift, the blockade was called off the following year. Following a decade of relative calm, the Soviet Union was once again up to no good. They were embarrassed by the steady flow of refugees from the Communist East into the Capitalist West part of Germany. In the first 11 days of August in 1961, 16,000 East Germans fled to West Germany. On August 12th alone, 2,400 people defected. It was then that Soviet Premier Kruschchev closed the border between East and West Berlin for good. In 1961 the Berlin Wall officially came into existence. It stood 12 feet tall and 4 feet wide until the fall of communism. During that time, the only way to cross the border was through one of three checkpoints: Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie. But travelers were rarely allowed to cross the border. The mischief of the USSR divided a city and separated friends, families, and loved ones. If you tried to cross the border you could be shot. At least 171 people died trying to escape to freedom. The Berlin Wall not only literally divided a city for 30 years, but stood as a brutal reminder of how cruel communism could be. It wasn't until communism began to thaw, with the help of President Reagan change was made. On June 12, 1987, President Reagan traveled to Berlin to view the wall. That afternoon, [[Page E899]] at the foot of the Brandenburg Gate, he made a speech that would reverberate across the world and through time. He spoke directly to Gorbachev and said, in part, ``Behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city, part of a vast system of barriers that divides the entire continent of Europe . . . Standing before the Brandenburg Gate, every man is a German, separated from his fellow men. Every man is a Berliner, forced to look upon a scar . . . in the West today, we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well-being unprecedented in all human history. In the Communist world, we see failure, technological backwardness, declining standards of health, even want of the most basic kind--too little food. Even today, the Soviet Union still cannot feed itself. After these four decades, then, there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion: Freedom leads to prosperity. Freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among the nations with comity and peace. Freedom is the victor . . . There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace. General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!'' The borders between East and West Germany were finally reopened in November 1989 and the official demolition of the Berlin Wall began on June 13, 1990, exactly 3 years and 1 day following President Reagan's speech. The June 12, 1987 speech given by President Reagan will be remembered forever as a win for freedom. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E898-E899] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUNE 12, 1987: RONALD REAGAN ADDRESSES PRESIDENT MIKHAIL GORBACHEV ______ HON.

It stood 12 feet tall and 4 feet wide until the fall of communism. During that time, the only way to cross the border was through one of three checkpoints: Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie. But travelers were rarely allowed to cross the border. The mischief of the USSR divided a city and separated friends, families, and loved ones. If you tried to cross the border you could be shot. At least 171 people died trying to escape to freedom. The Berlin Wall not only literally divided a city for 30 years, but stood as a brutal reminder of how cruel communism could be. It wasn't until communism began to thaw, with the help of President Reagan change was made. On June 12, 1987, President Reagan traveled to Berlin to view the wall. That afternoon, [[Page E899]] at the foot of the Brandenburg Gate, he made a speech that would reverberate across the world and through time. He spoke directly to Gorbachev and said, in part, ``Behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city, part of a vast system of barriers that divides the entire continent of Europe . . . Standing before the Brandenburg Gate, every man is a German, separated from his fellow men. Every man is a Berliner, forced to look upon a scar . . . in the West today, we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well-being unprecedented in all human history. In the Communist world, we see failure, technological backwardness, declining standards of health, even want of the most basic kind--too little food. Even today, the Soviet Union still cannot feed itself. After these four decades, then, there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion: Freedom leads to prosperity. Freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among the nations with comity and peace. Freedom is the victor . . . There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace. General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!'' The borders between East and West Germany were finally reopened in November 1989 and the official demolition of the Berlin Wall began on June 13, 1990, exactly 3 years and 1 day following President Reagan's speech. The June 12, 1987 speech given by President Reagan will be remembered forever as a win for freedom. And that's just the way it is. ____________________",package_114_183.csv,4751,4751,4817,"[congressional record volume 162, number 93 (monday, june 13, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e898-e899] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] june 12, 1987: ronald reagan addresses president mikhail gorbachev ______ hon. ted poe of texas in the house of representatives monday, june 13, 2016 mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, yesterday, june 12th marks an important date in united states policy. twenty-nine years to the day, president ronald reagan traveled to berlin to speak out against communism and call on the president of the soviet union, mikhail gorbachev, to tear down the berlin wall. this would become known as his famous ``tear down this wall'' speech. the berlin wall grew in the aftermath of the second world war. in 1945, the allies split a defeated germany into four allied occupation zones. the eastern part of the country went to the soviet union and the western part of germany went to the united states, great britain, and later france. even though berlin sat entirely in the soviet territory, it too was divided into eastern and western occupation zones with the soviets taking the east and the other allies taking the west part of the city. as berlin was split apart, so too was the relationship between the democratic united states and communist soviet union. these stark differences in political ideologies led to extreme tension in that area, and around the world. so much so that the soviet union would often play the role of mischief maker in germany. in 1948 the ussr began a blockade on west berlin in the hopes of driving out the western influences. however, due to the ingenious berlin airlift, the blockade was called off the following year. following a decade of relative calm, the soviet union was once again up to no good. they were embarrassed by the steady flow of refugees from the communist east into the capitalist west part of germany. in the first 11 days of august in 1961, 16,000 east germans fled to west germany. on august 12th alone, 2,400 people defected. it was then that soviet premier kruschchev closed the border between east and west berlin for good. in 1961 the berlin wall officially came into existence. it stood 12 feet tall and 4 feet wide until the fall of communism. during that time, the only way to cross the border was through one of three checkpoints: alpha, bravo, and charlie. but travelers were rarely allowed to cross the border. the mischief of the ussr divided a city and separated friends, families, and loved ones. if you tried to cross the border you could be shot. at least 171 people died trying to escape to freedom. the berlin wall not only literally divided a city for 30 years, but stood as a brutal reminder of how cruel communism could be. it wasn't until communism began to thaw, with the help of president reagan change was made. on june 12, 1987, president reagan traveled to berlin to view the wall. that afternoon, [[page e899]] at the foot of the brandenburg gate, he made a speech that would reverberate across the world and through time. he spoke directly to gorbachev and said, in part, ``behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city, part of a vast system of barriers that divides the entire continent of europe . . . standing before the brandenburg gate, every man is a german, separated from his fellow men. every man is a berliner, forced to look upon a scar . . . in the west today, we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well-being unprecedented in all human history. in the communist world, we see failure, technological backwardness, declining standards of health, even want of the most basic kind--too little food. even today, the soviet union still cannot feed itself. after these four decades, then, there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion: freedom leads to prosperity. freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among the nations with comity and peace. freedom is the victor . . . there is one sign the soviets can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace. general secretary gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe, if you seek liberalization: come here to this gate! mr. gorbachev, open this gate! mr. gorbachev, tear down this wall!'' the borders between east and west germany were finally reopened in november 1989 and the official demolition of the berlin wall began on june 13, 1990, exactly 3 years and 1 day following president reagan's speech. the june 12, 1987 speech given by president reagan will be remembered forever as a win for freedom. and that's just the way it is. ____________________",4751

LUDWIG ______ HON. TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, June 13, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Judge Edmund V. Ludwig of Doylestown, Pennsylvania, a retired U.S. District Court judge and prominent figure in the legal, cultural, and historic life of Bucks County who died on May 17, 2016, three days short of his 88th birthday. In June 1985, on the recommendation of U.S. Senators, John Heinz III and Arlen Specter, President Ronald Reagan nominated Ludwig to fill the seat vacated by Judge Raymond Broderick. The Senate confirmed the appointment, and Judge Ludwig took the bench on Oct. 17, 1985. He became a senior judge on May 20, 1997, and gradually reduced his workload until retiring a couple of years ago. In 1996, Judge Ludwig ordered Major League Baseball umpires to work through the World Series after they threatened to boycott games in the wake of the Roberto Alomar spitting incident. Angry over a third-strike call, Alomar, the Baltimore Orioles star second baseman, spit at umpire John Hirschbeck. Alomar claimed that the umpire had uttered a racial slur. Hirschbeck was furious at Alomar's comments, and other umpires were outraged by the incident. However, Judge Ludwig stayed above the fray. ``These umpires are the best, and without them, the harm to baseball will be irreparable,'' he ruled. ``The game of baseball occupies a special place in this country and it belongs to the millions of fans.'' Jeremy Heep, the judge's law clerk in the mid-1990s and now a partner at the Pepper Hamilton firm, said his former boss epitomized a true public servant. ``He was a wonderful judge in his own right, but in addition to that, he used the inherent prestige that came with the robe to influence society in a good way. It was a wonderful thing to watch,'' Heep said. ``He would quietly go behind the scenes, pick up the phone, and call people. He would further very good causes--promoting juvenile justice, improving mental health services in Pennsylvania, and getting the bar to improve indigent representation.'' An educator as well as a jurist, Judge Ludwig held faculty positions at Hahnemann University, Temple Law School, Villanova Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania. Among his many honors was the Justice William J. Brennan Jr. Distinguished Jurist Award from the Philadelphia Bar Association in 2005. Born in Philadelphia, he was the son of Henry and Ruth Viener Ludwig. He graduated from Germantown Friends School in 1945 and earned degrees from Harvard College and Harvard Law School. A Korean War veteran, he was honorably discharged with the rank of captain from the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps, after which he took up private practice in Doylestown. In 1968, Judge Ludwig was elected to Bucks County Court and served until 1985. In 1995, he founded the Doylestown Historical Society, of which he served as chair until 2011. Tina Mazaheri, the society's founding secretary, who served with him on its board of directors, said the judge wanted to ensure that future generations would have the means to enjoy the town and its history. Judge Ludwig helped establish social service programs, and served on the boards of groups focused on youth and juvenile justice, mental health, alternatives to incarceration, support for women, and rights for the disabled. In 1971, he cofounded TODAY Inc., a residential drug treatment program, and served on its board until 1985. Part of his effectiveness lay in his tenacious pursuit of any project he tackled. Ultimately, though, Judge Ludwig ``was always about making sure that people who needed help got help, and about recognizing those who gave the help, but not himself,'' Mazaheri said. An avid reader, Judge Ludwig enjoyed Shakespeare, poetry, and historical fiction. He delighted in telling jokes and exploring the art of the pun. He played and watched tennis, and loved to eat out at local restaurants with family and friends. He was married to Elizabeth Serkin for 18 years before they divorced. They had four children. [[Page E900]] He also was divorced from Sara Webster. Besides his former wives and daughter, he is survived by sons Edmund V. Jr., Toby, and David, and five grandchildren. A grandson preceded him in death. And that is just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 93 (Monday, June 13, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E899-E900] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A MEMORIAL TRIBUTE TO JUDGE EDMUND V.

An educator as well as a jurist, Judge Ludwig held faculty positions at Hahnemann University, Temple Law School, Villanova Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania. Among his many honors was the Justice William J. Brennan Jr. Distinguished Jurist Award from the Philadelphia Bar Association in 2005. Born in Philadelphia, he was the son of Henry and Ruth Viener Ludwig. He graduated from Germantown Friends School in 1945 and earned degrees from Harvard College and Harvard Law School. A Korean War veteran, he was honorably discharged with the rank of captain from the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps, after which he took up private practice in Doylestown. In 1968, Judge Ludwig was elected to Bucks County Court and served until 1985. In 1995, he founded the Doylestown Historical Society, of which he served as chair until 2011. Tina Mazaheri, the society's founding secretary, who served with him on its board of directors, said the judge wanted to ensure that future generations would have the means to enjoy the town and its history. Judge Ludwig helped establish social service programs, and served on the boards of groups focused on youth and juvenile justice, mental health, alternatives to incarceration, support for women, and rights for the disabled. In 1971, he cofounded TODAY Inc., a residential drug treatment program, and served on its board until 1985. Part of his effectiveness lay in his tenacious pursuit of any project he tackled. Ultimately, though, Judge Ludwig ``was always about making sure that people who needed help got help, and about recognizing those who gave the help, but not himself,'' Mazaheri said. An avid reader, Judge Ludwig enjoyed Shakespeare, poetry, and historical fiction. He delighted in telling jokes and exploring the art of the pun. He played and watched tennis, and loved to eat out at local restaurants with family and friends. He was married to Elizabeth Serkin for 18 years before they divorced. They had four children. [[Page E900]] He also was divorced from Sara Webster. Besides his former wives and daughter, he is survived by sons Edmund V. Jr., Toby, and David, and five grandchildren. A grandson preceded him in death. And that is just the way it is. ____________________",package_114_183.csv,4573,4573,4639,"[congressional record volume 162, number 93 (monday, june 13, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e899-e900] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] a memorial tribute to judge edmund v. ludwig ______ hon. ted poe of texas in the house of representatives monday, june 13, 2016 mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, i rise today to honor the memory of judge edmund v. ludwig of doylestown, pennsylvania, a retired u.s. district court judge and prominent figure in the legal, cultural, and historic life of bucks county who died on may 17, 2016, three days short of his 88th birthday. in june 1985, on the recommendation of u.s. senators, john heinz iii and arlen specter, president ronald reagan nominated ludwig to fill the seat vacated by judge raymond broderick. the senate confirmed the appointment, and judge ludwig took the bench on oct. 17, 1985. he became a senior judge on may 20, 1997, and gradually reduced his workload until retiring a couple of years ago. in 1996, judge ludwig ordered major league baseball umpires to work through the world series after they threatened to boycott games in the wake of the roberto alomar spitting incident. angry over a third-strike call, alomar, the baltimore orioles star second baseman, spit at umpire john hirschbeck. alomar claimed that the umpire had uttered a racial slur. hirschbeck was furious at alomar's comments, and other umpires were outraged by the incident. however, judge ludwig stayed above the fray. ``these umpires are the best, and without them, the harm to baseball will be irreparable,'' he ruled. ``the game of baseball occupies a special place in this country and it belongs to the millions of fans.'' jeremy heep, the judge's law clerk in the mid-1990s and now a partner at the pepper hamilton firm, said his former boss epitomized a true public servant. ``he was a wonderful judge in his own right, but in addition to that, he used the inherent prestige that came with the robe to influence society in a good way. it was a wonderful thing to watch,'' heep said. ``he would quietly go behind the scenes, pick up the phone, and call people. he would further very good causes--promoting juvenile justice, improving mental health services in pennsylvania, and getting the bar to improve indigent representation.'' an educator as well as a jurist, judge ludwig held faculty positions at hahnemann university, temple law school, villanova law school, and the university of pennsylvania. among his many honors was the justice william j. brennan jr. distinguished jurist award from the philadelphia bar association in 2005. born in philadelphia, he was the son of henry and ruth viener ludwig. he graduated from germantown friends school in 1945 and earned degrees from harvard college and harvard law school. a korean war veteran, he was honorably discharged with the rank of captain from the army judge advocate general's corps, after which he took up private practice in doylestown. in 1968, judge ludwig was elected to bucks county court and served until 1985. in 1995, he founded the doylestown historical society, of which he served as chair until 2011. tina mazaheri, the society's founding secretary, who served with him on its board of directors, said the judge wanted to ensure that future generations would have the means to enjoy the town and its history. judge ludwig helped establish social service programs, and served on the boards of groups focused on youth and juvenile justice, mental health, alternatives to incarceration, support for women, and rights for the disabled. in 1971, he cofounded today inc., a residential drug treatment program, and served on its board until 1985. part of his effectiveness lay in his tenacious pursuit of any project he tackled. ultimately, though, judge ludwig ``was always about making sure that people who needed help got help, and about recognizing those who gave the help, but not himself,'' mazaheri said. an avid reader, judge ludwig enjoyed shakespeare, poetry, and historical fiction. he delighted in telling jokes and exploring the art of the pun. he played and watched tennis, and loved to eat out at local restaurants with family and friends. he was married to elizabeth serkin for 18 years before they divorced. they had four children.
