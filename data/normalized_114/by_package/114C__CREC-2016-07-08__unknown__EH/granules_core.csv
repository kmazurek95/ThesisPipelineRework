Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, we are all stunned by the events last night in Dallas, and we are all outraged. An attack on the people who protect us is an attack on all of us. Our hearts are with the Dallas Police Department. Our hearts are with the victims, and especially with their loved ones. They wear the badge, too. I know that to be a cop's wife or a cop's husband is to prepare for the worst, but who could fathom such horror as this. There is no cause or context in which this violence, this kind of terror, is justified--none at all. There will be a temptation to let our anger harden our divisions. Let's not let that happen. There is going to be a temptation to let our anger send us further into our corners. Let's not let that happen. That script is just too easy to write. It is too predictable. Let's defy those predictions. A few perpetrators of evil do not represent us. They do not control us. The blame lies with the people who committed these vicious acts and no one else. As the President rightfully said: Justice will be done. [[Page H4552]] We also have to let healing be done as well. This has been a long week for our country. It has been a long month for America. We have seen terrible, terrible, senseless things. Every Member of this body, every Republican and every Democrat, wants to see less gun violence. Every Member of this body wants a world in which people feel safe, regardless of the color of their skin. That is not how people are feeling these days. Sometimes we disagree on how to get there. Sometimes we disagree passionately on how to get there. But in having this debate, let's not lose sight of the values that unite us. Let's not lose sight in our common humanity, the values that brought those protestors to the streets of Dallas, the values that brought those protestors to the streets of Washington last night. Respect, decency, compassion, humanity, if we lose those fundamental things, what is left? We need to take a moment here for reflection, for thought, for prayer, for justice, for action.

Mr. LaMALFA.

They stood in the gap-- even keeping order as their fellow officers were falling--as they were being protested in the march over recent tragic events that had happened elsewhere in our Nation. As the sniper shots rang out, and as they saw their brothers falling, these Dallas officers still responded to their internal call to duty to protect not themselves, but the innocent demonstrators that were also in that line of fire. Mr. Speaker, time and again, America's police show their commitment to all lives, and we know they will continue to do so.

The past few days have seen too much death and too much heartbreak. As Reverend Martin Luther King wrote: ``Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the House on the passage of H.R. 5210, which it passed this week. This legislation provides relief to durable medical equipment providers in competitively bid areas until October 1, 2017. Competitive bidding was created by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. H.R. 5210 extends the current phase-in of competitively bid DME prices to noncompetitively bid areas. This is vital to ensure that Congress has enough time to monitor current phase-in of noncompetitively bid DME prices and their effect in rural areas. In January of 2016, the competitive bidding program began its nationwide rollout, and, as a result, many areas, including rural areas, saw a significant cut in prices, which is now jeopardizing access to durable medical equipment for many beneficiaries. The First Congressional District of Georgia has numerous durable medical device companies that provide services throughout all of southeast Georgia.

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the House on the passage of H.R. 5210, which it passed this week. This legislation provides relief to durable medical equipment providers in competitively bid areas until October 1, 2017. Competitive bidding was created by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. H.R. 5210 extends the current phase-in of competitively bid DME prices to noncompetitively bid areas. This is vital to ensure that Congress has enough time to monitor current phase-in of noncompetitively bid DME prices and their effect in rural areas. In January of 2016, the competitive bidding program began its nationwide rollout, and, as a result, many areas, including rural areas, saw a significant cut in prices, which is now jeopardizing access to durable medical equipment for many beneficiaries. The First Congressional District of Georgia has numerous durable medical device companies that provide services throughout all of southeast Georgia.

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the players and coaches of the Bellefonte High School Red Raiders baseball team, in Pennsylvania's Fifth District, for their PIAA Class AAA championship 2-0 win over Susquehanna Township. It is Bellefonte's first State title in baseball in school history. Remarkably, the Red Raiders started this year with a 1-7 record. When most teams would have lost heart and the will to win, these young men served as an inspiration. At the championship game, Dom Masullo pitched a complete game, allowing five hits and struck out five batters. Colton Burd stole second and scored on a single by Tyler Kreger to give the Red Raiders a 1-0 lead. Bellefonte pushed its lead to 2-0 after Garrett Reiter scored. Coach Dan Fravel offered this observation, saying, ``I don't know why you would play the game if you don't plan on winning every game. That's just my mentality, and it's a compliment to them as a group. I've watched them play the last couple of years. I knew that there were talented kids on the team, and they know how to win.''

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 809, I call up the conference report on the bill (S. 524) to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 809, the conference report is considered read. (For conference report and statement, see proceedings of the House of July 6, 2016, at page H4392.) The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the conference report to accompany S. 524. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The simple truth is that we are in the midst of a real epidemic. Nearly every 12 minutes, someone in America dies of a drug overdose. The CDC reports over a quarter billion opioid prescriptions were written in the year 2012. The abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin has impacted, virtually, every single community. It is an epidemic that has no boundaries and does not discriminate. In my State of Michigan, we are seeing 10 times as many deaths today as there were 15 years ago. Sadly, the number continues to surge; but behind every statistic is a person who was loved, part of a family and community, and, yes, who was lost too soon. {time} 1045 It is a frightening reality, but we have to face this epidemic head on, and today's vote is an important step forward. Since the beginning of this process, our focus has been, and continues to be, on attacking this public health crisis from every side, from zeroing in on treatment for addiction and overdoses to reforming prescription practices in the delivery of medicines and working with law enforcement of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Specifically, this conference report addresses prevention care by requiring HHS to create an interagency task force to address chronic and pain management care and by reauthorizing NASPER, a piece of legislation the House has passed with very large bipartisan support. The conference report addresses treatment by ensuring opioid reversal medication is accessible to patients, their family members and, yes, first responders as well. These medications are key to stopping the overdose epidemic and getting these patients into proper treatment to become productive members of our society. The conference report also ensures proper oversight and accountability by including the majority leader's OPEN Act. The conference report, as a whole, touches on the spectrum of issues driving the opioid crisis. While there is no one solution, we are making progress in addressing a problem that has rapidly grown. So I want to thank all my colleagues--certainly on the Energy and Commerce Committee that I chair and those off--for working to advance these important bipartisan bills that will make a real difference in our communities. I am also proud that our final package has achieved the support of over 200 of the Nation's leading advocacy groups, groups from across the country that are focused on recovery. These advocates are on the front lines in this epidemic and truly appreciate the positive impact that our solutions will have in every community. There is an urgency to our work as drug overdose deaths surge in Michigan and beyond. We owe this effort to the past, present, and, sadly, future victims of the opioid epidemic; our neighbors, friends, family across every part of the family in every demographic group. So let's come together and get the job done. What we are doing will save lives. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. After much thought, I have decided to support the conference report on S. 524. It is not perfect and does not nearly do enough from a funding perspective, but it makes some important steps that would allow us to begin to address the opioid addiction crisis that is impacting our Nation. The American people are desperate for relief from the opioid epidemic currently devastating our country, and they are depending on this Congress to act. By now, we have all heard the stories: young people taken from their families in their prime; babies born suffering from the cruel effects of opioid withdrawal; and parents who have lost the ability to care for their families as they battle their addiction. To treat this epidemic as anything less than a national crisis would be a terrible mistake. And even though we have already lost far too many lives to overdoses, we still have an opportunity to save many more. This conference report includes many important policies that have bipartisan agreement. For example, we will now allow patients and doctors to choose to partially fill their opioids so that excess medicines are not dispensed unnecessarily. This will reduce the number of unused pills in circulation, which will reduce the risk of misuse, diversion, and overdose. The conference report also allows nurse practitioners and physician assistants to treat individuals with [[Page H4555]] opioid use disorders with buprenorphine. This final report also includes important and proven programs to address prevention, treatment, and recovery; but just changing policies alone won't be enough. This legislation takes only a small step at a time when the American people need us to run. Mr. Speaker, how can we truly help the American people without giving them the resources to fight this epidemic? We cannot wait while lives continue to be destroyed by opiate addiction and while treatment options remain out of reach. Congressional Democrats, Mr. Speaker, have long advocated for more funding in this package and have even proposed bipartisan policies to offset the cost, but Republicans have stubbornly refused to commit essential funding as part of this overall bill. Time and again they have rejected efforts to make a real difference by going beyond the important policy changes in this bill and actually supporting significant funding to properly take on this growing national epidemic today. Instead, Republicans have committed to increasing funding through the appropriations process, and we will certainly make sure that they live up to the repeated promises they have made in this regard. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this conference report to S. 524. This conference report is one of the proudest moments I have had as an elected Member of this body. I believe there are numerous challenges that our community healthcare providers face, and this bill helps them address those challenges. As a lifelong pharmacist, I believe the key first steps to address this opioid epidemic is education, improvement of treatment, and a reliance on State PDMP programs. This bill does all of that. Many of my colleagues have opposed this conference report and this bill because it does not authorize enough money or it doesn't provide every provision they want. There are things that I would have changed in this bill, but we have all had an opportunity to amend these provisions, and this has created a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation. Overall, this should not be the end of this conversation, but this bill is a good bill and addresses many of the problems Americans face with opioid addiction. I would like to commend leadership from both Chambers on this bill, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind). Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. There is no question that we have an opiate epidemic sweeping our communities throughout Wisconsin and the rest of the Nation. I spent the better part of the last year holding listening sessions back home in my congressional district in western and north central Wisconsin, getting feedback from law enforcement, healthcare providers, treatment centers, and families that have been impacted by drug addiction and the opioid addiction to ensure that this legislation that we have pending before us today doesn't get too far out ahead of what they actually need. There are a lot of good policy changes in this bill, but one thing that is lacking that the gentleman also pointed out is the resource aspect of this. They do need tools. They do need additional resources. I am hoping that later in the year, whether it is through a continuing resolution or the funding of these operations, that we can find in a bipartisan way the increase of necessary resources for folks back home so that they can get out ahead of this curve and do an adequate job of turning the trend line away. I am also supportive because the legislation before us contains the Jason Simcakoski PROMISE Act. Jason Simcakoski was a veteran who died at the Tomah VA Medical Center a couple of years ago due to an opioid drug overdose. We have, in this legislation, a continuation of reforms that are being implemented to ensure that all of our veterans, whether in Wisconsin or throughout the Nation, are getting the care and the treatment they need; that we continue down the road of revamping the pain management practices at places like Tomah. I am confident that with the provisions in here, if we do this the right way, that Tomah and the VA system could be a model of proper pain management practices not just within the VA system, but throughout the entire healthcare system. There is no question we haven't done a good job of managing pain as a nation. That is true of whether it is in the VA. It is true whether it is in the private health sector. This legislation before us today gives us an opportunity to continue down that road and do a much better job. The Jason Simcakoski Act, for instance, will call for clinical practice guidelines to be instituted throughout the entire VA system. It enhances pain management education and training for our healthcare providers. It improves realtime tracking and access to data on opioid usage. It also expands opiate safety initiatives throughout all the VA centers. It expands the patient advocacy program, which is particularly important because I think the families are the first line of defense when it comes to the care and treatment of all our veterans. They know what is working and what isn't. They need greater input and better lines of communication to help affect the course of treatment that is impacting the veterans in their life. It also calls on the VA to explore more complimentary and alternative forms of medicine to deal with pain management so we are not just loading our veterans up with a cocktail of prescription drugs, which oftentimes lead to addiction which can lead to meth and heroin usage. I also think that this legislation gives us an opportunity to establish that strong partnership that needs to exist at the Federal, State, and local level, including private entities, so we can do a better job on the opioid addiction problem throughout our Nation. This is an all-hands-on-deck moment. As a former special prosecutor who had to deal in the criminal system with a lot of it, our response cannot just be a criminal justice response. It has to be a public health response or we lose this battle going into it. I think this legislation does provide crucial tools to help us make that pivot, but we also need the crucial resources; and that is something that we are going to have to address as this year progresses. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. I appreciate the hard work that the committees and those involved have put into this legislation. But it will be a work in progress, and we have to continue to listen to the folks on the ground back home to ensure that they are getting the help and support that they need. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Chairman Upton's leadership and partnership throughout this important effort. Today is a proud day in our Nation's history. Today the House will complete its work on a comprehensive legislative package to combat the terrible epidemic of opioid abuse, which is ravaging our country. We have all heard the grim statistics. 129 people die every day from drug overdose. That is more than 47,000 a year. These people are our neighbors, friends, and loved ones. They come from all walks of life and all communities. They need our help. Today, the House is answering the call. The conference report we are considering today represents a truly comprehensive response to the opioid epidemic. It includes provisions from 18 bills passed by the House in May and addresses all facets of the epidemic. It permits the government to make grants for purposes of prevention, treatment and recovery, overdose reversal through the use of FDA-approved and appropriately labeled drugs and devices, and law enforcement and investigative purposes. Significantly, the conference report preserves the provisions of the Judiciary Committee's flagship bill, H.R. [[Page H4556]] 5046, which passed this House in May by an overwhelming 413-5 vote. This historic legislation, which was sponsored by Crime Subcommittee Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner, creates a comprehensive Justice Department grant program to help States fight opioid addiction. It authorizes $103 million annually over 5 years for the grant program. It directs precious taxpayer dollars responsibly by leveraging and streamlining existing programs, and it is fully offsetting the legislation in compliance with the House's CutGo proposal. The conference report authorizes this funding for a wide variety of anti-opioid activities, including drug courts which have proven to be highly successful and which I support. In fact, it is my expectation, Mr. Speaker, that drug courts will continue to receive funding levels in future years similar to current funding levels. In addition to H.R. 5046, this conference report contains provisions from three other Judiciary Committee bills, including H.R. 5052, the OPEN Act, which increases the transparency and accountability of the comprehensive opioid abuse grant program in H.R. 5046; H.R. 4985, the Kingpin Designation Improvement Act, which protects classified information from disclosure when a drug kingpin challenges his designation as such in a Federal court; and H.R. 5048, the Good Samaritan Assessment Act, which requires the GAO to study State and local Good Samaritan laws that protect caregivers, law enforcement personnel, and first responders who administer opioid overdose reversal drugs or devices from criminal or civil liability, as well as those who contact emergency service providers in response to an overdose. In addition, the Judiciary Committee moved as part of this package S. 32, the Transnational Drug Trafficking Act. That legislation, which has already been signed into law, improves law enforcement's ability to pursue international drug manufacturers, brokers, and distributors in source nations. Federal prosecutors can now use the important tools in that bill to pursue foreign drug traffickers who are poisoning American citizens. Along with the excellent legislation prepared by our sister committees, spearheaded by Chairmen Upton, Miller, and Kline, these bills make substantial policy changes within the Federal agencies responsible for fighting addiction. They take real steps to address the opioid epidemic and provide real relief for a real problem affecting real Americans. Members of this body should be proud of these accomplishments. {time} 1100 I would like to stress, Mr. Speaker, that opposition to this conference report on the basis of funding is wrong and misguided. As I stated, this legislation authorizes $103 million just for Justice Department programs. Under the leadership of Chairmen Rogers, Culberson, Cole, Crenshaw, and Dent, the House Committee on Appropriations has responded admirably to this epidemic by allocating hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for these programs. The CJS appropriations bill contains $103 million in funding for the DOJ program. The Labor/HHS bill, released Wednesday, contains $581 million to address opioid and heroin abuse, which is above even the President's budget request. The Financial Services and General Government bill has funded High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas and Drug-Free Communities Support Programs at record highs. Nobody can come to this floor and credibly claim that the House is not putting its money where its mouth is. I thank my colleagues for their support and hard work. Yesterday we received a letter signed by 233 addiction stakeholder groups, endorsing the conference report to S. 524. I urge everyone to support this conference report. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his excellent work in bringing this bipartisan legislation to the floor. With all due respect to Mr. Goodlatte, I credibly come to the floor to say that this bill does not provide the funding that we need to address the opioid crisis in our country. I thank Mr. Upton again. I know this is his last year as chairman of the committee. I thank him for his openness, his willingness to work in a bipartisan way, and I do think that this is a good piece of legislation. It is lacking one thing: the resources to get the job done. I also come to the floor as an appropriator, and to hear Mr. Goodlatte say what is coming out of here and coming out of there, in our subcommittee on Labor/HHS, we call it the lamb-eat-lamb committee because there was no good place to take money from. We had carefully and economically husbanded the resources in such a way, when we did budget agreements, to use the money very well for its purposes: the investments in education and health, et cetera. So when an emergency comes along like the opioid epidemic, like Zika, like Flint, these are emergencies, and by tradition, this House has always declared emergencies--whether a natural disaster or otherwise-- to say that funding would not be lamb-eat-lamb within the appropriations process and take funds from very needed initiatives that Congress had agreed to in our own authorizations otherwise. So it had been my intention for us to come to the floor to oppose this bill to be able to sustain a Presidential veto until there would be resources. But in the spirit of this day, we come to the floor instead to say let's move the process along, but let's also say that there are other issues, like opioids, and Zika, and Flint that we really have to address in the near term. The opioid epidemic, as it has been said by the distinguished chairman and ranking member and others, is such an important challenge to the well-being of our country. While you may say Flint is in Michigan and Zika is down south, the fact is they affect all of us. But opioids are right there in all of our communities, and all of the Members of Congress immediately see the need for the authorization but also for the funding. The opioid conference report includes many important authorizing provisions in a bipartisan way, but it does not include the new funds that are essential to saving lives from opioids. Around a dozen law enforcement people were at the White House yesterday talking about the opioid epidemic. Many people outside of the Congress support the principles in this bill. But do you know that some of those law enforcement officials are having separate fundraisers of their own in order to help people address their opioid challenge? We are just not living up to our responsibility in a timely fashion. Within the next week, hopefully, we will leave with some additional funding. The President has asked for $1.1 billion to address the problem. The distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary says that the appropriators are putting more than that in certain cases in opioids; but if they are taking it out of other priorities, other investments in the health and well-being and the security of the American people, we are doing this at the expense of other good investments. We will not stop fighting until America's families have the prevention, treatment, and recovery resources they need to overcome the opioid epidemic, and that is why for today, although the votes are there to sustain a Presidential veto, we don't encourage that. We encourage our cooperation today with the hope and the promise that Mr. Rogers, whom we all respect--I served with him on Appropriations-- and Mrs. Lowey can come to terms in a way that does not have the opioid epidemic funded at the expense of other investments important to the American people. It is a priority. It is an emergency. In other cases we have had emergency spending for just that. When we do budget agreements, as we did last year--very difficult staying under the caps and the rest--it was not with the idea that there would be a $1.1 billion need for opioids or $1.9 billion need for Zika funding or there wouldn't be hundreds of millions of dollars for Flint. These are extraordinary emergencies. They should be treated that way. Nonetheless, I congratulate Mr. Upton and Mr. Pallone and all who had a role in putting this legislation together. I hope that it is just a first [[Page H4557]] step that in the very, very near future we will have money to match the values that are contained in this legislation. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 21 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 22\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, a partner in this effort from day one. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I would briefly like to discuss with my friend and partner in this effort, the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, how the conference report encourages innovation by allowing alternative therapies to qualify for funding while also requiring evaluation and reporting on the effectiveness of all authorized programs. In my district, some nonprofit organizations are using animal- assisted psychotherapy to successfully address mental health and personal development needs, including for veterans, and animals have also helped prison inmates achieve life-changing developments. It is my understanding that these and other alternative therapies are eligible for funding under the grant programs contained in the conference report. And I would ask the gentleman from Michigan: Is that your understanding as well? Mr. UPTON. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. UPTON. Absolutely is the answer, yes. Section 601, the State demonstration grants for comprehensive opioid abuse response, is designed to allow States the flexibility to do what is right and aid in establishing a comprehensive response. Under this grant, we emphasize prevention and treatment, but those are not the only two ways to address the opioid epidemic. Recovery, like the good work that Chairman Goodlatte cited in his district, as it is in mine, is equally as important. We need a comprehensive response to the crisis that should leave no stone unturned in our quest for helping those in need. I want to thank the chairman for his help in that effort, and I absolutely agree with his reading of the bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues argue that we will pass this authorization bill today, and then sometime down the line we will provide funding through the regular appropriations process. But the problem is that that response does not match the urgency of the crisis. To understand why, let's just take a quick look at the 2016 appropriations process. While the fiscal year 2016 began on October 1, 2015, the omnibus fiscal year 2016 appropriations act did not become law until December 18, 2015. If, as expected, the fiscal year 2017 process is similar, it will be at least 6 months before we can provide funding through the fiscal year 2017 appropriations process; and that is 6 months in which more people will die from potentially preventable overdose deaths and more individuals and families in need of treatment options will be unable to access them. There is also no guarantee that additional funds will be made available through the appropriations process. The fiscal austerity policies of my Republican colleagues also make this option untenable. Due to the sequestration caps demanded by the Republicans, an increase in spending for one program can only occur with the cutting of funding for another program. While the Republicans will say they introduced a Labor/HHS bill with $500 million in funding for a comprehensive State grant program for substance abuse treatment, what they don't say is that to provide that funding, we will have to agree to cut funding for other critical programs. The Republican Labor/HHS appropriations bill proposes eliminating funding for ObamaCare, title X family planning services, education programs, and employment training and development programs. Not only are these cuts objectionable, we don't have to make such choices. We have bipartisan pay-fors available to offset the direct appropriations of funding now, and we cannot afford to wait. So this is truly an urgent crisis, and we should treat it as such by providing critical funding immediately. Failure to act will unacceptably lead to more deaths, and our communities cannot afford to wait any longer. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a fellow conferee and member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this conference report. It is a great step forward in the fight against the scourge of drug addiction. I was proud to serve on the conference committee that crafted this package, and I thank Chairman Upton and Chairman Grassley for their tremendous leadership on the issue. This measure includes language that I authored with my Democratic colleague, Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney of the Hudson Valley in New York State, that targets opioid addiction's strong ties to prescription drug abuse and the issue of overprescription. It is one part of a comprehensive plan that will make serious progress on this challenge that strains law enforcement and taxpayer resources and cuts too many lives tragically short. This package comes the same week we secured passage of a landmark overhaul of our Nation's mental health care system. These are major priorities of the American people, and this is how Congress should work, gaining ideas and insight from the constituencies across the Nation and working together in a bipartisan fashion to address the important issues confronting the United States. On this very sad day, given the horrific events in Dallas last night, we are reminded that a great many issues face our country. I hope the spirit of cooperation that secured this week's productivity will guide us on the other challenges we face as a nation. I want to work on what unites us in the United States and on the priorities of all Americans. This conference report is one of those priorities, and I urge a ``yes'' vote. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as I said before, this conference report does include important and proven programs to address prevention, treatment, and recovery with regard to opioid abuse, and I did want to mention a few. There is authorization to create a grant program for eligible entities to promote the prescribing of opioid reversal drugs, naloxone, in conjunction with opiates for patients at an elevated risk of overdose. There is a program to reauthorize SAMHSA grants for the funding of residential treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorders. There is a demonstration grant program to States to streamline State requirements and procedures in order to assist veterans who have completed military emergency medical technician training to meet requirements for becoming an emergency medical technician in the State. There is also a State grant program to increase the implementation of standing orders for opioid overdose reversal medication, again, naloxone. As I have said before, there are a number of very important programs here that authorize grants to States to deal with the prevention, treatment, and recovery from opioids. But, again, these programs will not be effective without some significant funding provided pursuant to those authorizations. So I want to stress, again, as Democrats, we support this bill because it does have authorization for many programs that will help with opioid addiction, but we need to hold the Republicans' feet to the fire to make sure that this funding is actually provided. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1115 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan), a fellow conferee and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. [[Page H4558]] Mr. MEEHAN. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this important bill. Mr. Speaker, the statistics are staggering. We are losing 120 a people a day to opioid abuse. Earlier this year, southeastern Pennsylvania lost an accomplished young man, John Decker, who succumbed to his battle with addiction. As a teenager, John injured his knee playing basketball. His physician prescribed opioids to manage the pain after surgery. John became addicted to the painkillers and moved on to using heroin. I introduced the John Thomas Decker Act with the goal of preventing injured youth and adolescent athletes from getting addicted to opioids and turning to heroin. But I use John's name because it is not about statistics; it is to demonstrate that we are talking about real people and struggling families here. The legislation, which is included in section 104 of the conference report, directs the United States Department of Health and Human Services to study what information and resources are available to youth athletes and their families regarding the dangers of opioid use and abuse, nonopioid treatment options, and how to seek addiction treatment. The Department must report its findings and work with stakeholders to disseminate resources to students, parents, and those involved in treating sports injuries, and that is how this can work together with things that are already happening in the community. I want to acknowledge what is going on in communities all across the country. Just last week, I visited Adapt Pharma, a constituent company, in Radnor, Pennsylvania. The company makes a Narcan nasal spray and is providing the antidote to high schools. Adapt Pharma and the National Association of School Nurses are working together to ensure that educational materials are available to students and their families about prescription drug abuse as well as treatment and recovery options that will work perfectly in tandem with this particular section. So, whether you are young athletes, pregnant mothers, struggling veterans, or suffering families, so many are going to be helped. I urge my colleagues to stand with the families who have suffered the effects of addiction and support the conference report. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the dean of the House and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, the crisis of opioid abuse and addiction clearly requires our immediate attention. I believe that that is now happening. I am grateful for the tireless work of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. I thank Chairman Goodlatte; Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee chairman, Jim Sensenbrenner; Crime Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee ranking member, Sheila Jackson Lee; and their staffs. And I also congratulate Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, who worked so hard to ensure this bill would find promising approaches to opioid abuse that were pioneered in her district. Finally, I wish to thank the ranking member, Frank Pallone of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and his staff for their assistance and coordination in this effort. Our work has focused on the need to address an urgent crisis. In my State of Michigan, there were 1,745 drug overdoses in the year 2014, and more than half of those overdose deaths were caused by opioids and heroin. Each day, 78 Americans die from an opioid overdose. Fortunately, we now have a better way of addressing issues of addiction, and we know that incarceration is not the answer. For instance, the Judiciary Committee's Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee held a hearing last year that examined, among other things, the promising use of the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion approach employed in cities such as Seattle, Washington, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. We know that there are effective ways to get addicts to treatment and to quickly provide them with needed services that address their addiction and prevent recidivism, and we know that evidence-based treatment and alternatives to incarceration work. Title II of this bill reflects much of this approach in the grant program, as reported by the Judiciary Committee and passed by the House in May of this year. While I have supported this effort, I have also supported alternative approaches that provide separate grant programs for many of these worthy purposes. Regardless of which approach we take, we must do more than simply authorize funding. We must provide real dollars that are urgently needed by those fighting this crisis, and I am disappointed that this bill does not do this. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great State of Michigan (Mr. Trott), a fellow conferee. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the conference report that we are considering today. And as my colleague, Mr. Conyers, just mentioned, 1,745 individuals died of a drug overdose in Michigan in 2014, and 449 of those individuals were in my home district in Oakland and Wayne Counties. So a disproportionate number of people were affected. As has been mentioned, this bill contains some good solutions toward fighting this epidemic: a comprehensive grant program, changes to existing law, and some new programs to help end the tragedies. Some have suggested, however, that our response is inadequate or too small of a step to fight this problem. I disagree. Let me say to those people who are listening, particularly those who have suffered from addiction or lost a loved one through the tragedy of an overdose, that Republicans and Democrats and the President recognize this epidemic. We are united in our commitment to defeat the abuse and tragedy. We in Congress will revisit our programs and solutions and the money we are spending to make sure that they are making a difference, and we will revisit the solutions and make sure that adequate resources are in place so we can end the terrible drug abuse and heroin overdoses that are affecting our communities. I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to serve on the conference committee. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to stress that President Obama recently announced additional actions to expand access to treatment, strengthen prescription drug monitoring, enable safe disposal of unneeded drugs, and accelerate research on pain and opioid misuse and overdose. The President, I think, has made it clear that addressing this epidemic is a priority for his administration. While Federal agencies have been using their authority to take every available action they can, Congress needs to provide additional funding to make lifesaving treatment available to everyone who needs it. The President has called for $1.1 billion in new funding to help Americans who want treatment wherever they live. Every day that passes without congressional action to provide these additional resources is a missed opportunity to get treatment to those who want it, help prevent overdoses, and support communities across the country impacted by this epidemic. Recovery from opioid and other substance use disorders is possible, and many Americans are able to recover because they get the treatment and care they need. But too many still are not able to get treatment. That is why the President has called on Congress to provide the resources needed to ensure that every American with an opioid use disorder who wants treatment can get it and start on the road to recovery. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), also a conferee and a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. We all have experienced the opioid epidemic in some way, whether it is through family, friends, or heartbreaking stories from constituents back home. [[Page H4559]] Opioid addiction is prevalent in our veteran community, and I am proud many of my provisions to help our heroes were included in this legislation. I want to thank the chairman for including those provisions in this particular conference report. My bills, the PROMISE Act and COVER Act, will update the clinical practice guidelines used to treat our servicemembers for pain management and provide a pathway forward to implement complementary and integrative health alternatives within the VA. With this bill, we can help our struggling heroes and others battling addiction across the Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on each side. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 14 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Michigan has 14\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), my partner in terms of a contiguous border and also a conferee. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This vital bill will help address the prescription drug epidemic we have seen plague our communities for so long. Dozens of Americans die each day from prescription drug overdoses. This has to stop. It is time for us to come together as a nation to tackle the issue that has infected every fabric of our society. I am very honored to have served on this conference committee for the bill, and I am thankful it is being considered today by the House. As a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have seen the opioid epidemic's effects on our Nation's veterans. Veterans are more vulnerable to chronic pain, more susceptible to addiction, but some VA facilities still overprescribe these powerful drugs. I have seen the problem firsthand with veterans coming into my office, often carrying a large box or bag of pills. In my home State of Indiana, the DEA raided the VA Medical Center in Marion after noticing the volume of narcotics and opioids purchased by the facility. For too long, the VA has relied too heavily on opioids to treat chronic pain. This bill addresses that by requiring the VA and the DOD to focus on improving their prescribing practices. It includes my piece of legislation requiring the VA to report to State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs, which are important and effective tools for stopping overprescription. It also allows the VA to consider nonopioid treatments for veterans with chronic pain. Mr. Speaker, there is a long battle ahead of us--we have got a long way to go, and a lot of damage has been done--but this bill represents an important step forward as we seek to stop overprescription and opioid addiction in our country. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters). Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, across the United States, we are faced with a substance abuse epidemic that results in overdose, addiction, and far too many deaths. From opioids to heroin, no community--not even Orange County, the place that I have called home for over 50 years--is immune. Last year, the number of deaths in Orange County caused by drug overdose rose to 400, the highest level in at least a decade. More than two-thirds of these untimely deaths involved opioids. Nationwide, nearly 130 people die every single day from drug abuse. Though this is a nationwide epidemic, there is not a one-size-fits- all cure to addiction. That is why this legislation is so important. I thank all of my colleagues who have worked so intently on these lifesaving policies. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure so that we can send it to the President's desk. As soon as this law is implemented, it will save lives and help Americans suffering from addiction reclaim their lives. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to again point out that the effort here is not only bipartisan, but we are also working with the administration to try to address this epidemic. And one of the things that we were trying to do with the legislation, but it became unnecessary because of the President's executive action, was with regard to bup. {time} 1130 This is a painkiller, if you will, that is used as an alternative to the addictive painkillers that cause the opiate problem. And until recently, under the law, a physician could only have up to 100 patients to whom he was administering bup, but now, in the last week or so, the President announced that that cap has been lifted to 275. Now, in the legislation, we do expand the types of providers who can treat opioid dependence using bup, but, at the same time, it was necessary, I believe, to raise that cap because there is a waiting list--a rather extensive waiting list--for people who would like to take advantage of bup. So I just wanted to say that that is one of the most important things that actually was done by the President. And it is very important for us to work together not only in terms of what we authorize, but also providing the funding for many of these programs, both what we are now authorizing pursuant to grants in this legislation, as well as what the administration is doing through agency action. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus). Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I commend the chairman, the ranking member, the conferees, on this work that they have accomplished. The opioid and heroin epidemic has hit western Pennsylvania hard. Nothing brings this crisis into sharper focus than when you are speaking with a parent who has lost a child, or a family member watching a loved one go through revolving doors of treatment and still be slipping away. This conference report has been a bipartisan, all-hands-on-deck effort reflective of the collaboration we see happening at the grassroots of our communities. I am pleased to see the conference report include the provision my colleague from across the aisle, Congressman Keating, and I championed in the House legislation to establish coprescribing guidelines for overdose antidotes such as naloxone. I am also pleased with how this legislation gives the proper focus to our veterans. This conference report is a necessary step in moving forward to address this crisis. Let us continue to work together to combat this deadly scourge. I urge its passage. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Again, Mr. Speaker, I will say that, after thoughtful consideration, I not only support the conference report, but I would urge my colleagues on the Democratic side to support the conference report. While I continue to believe that we cannot turn the tide on this epidemic without dedicated additional resources for States, the underlying policies included in this bill are important steps forward. As you know, Democratic conferees, along with the Democratic leadership, have worked tirelessly these past few weeks to try to include money for States to help treat our communities who are suffering. Republicans still, so far, refuse to commit the essential funding as part of this overall bill, but they have committed to increasing funding through the appropriations process, and I will continue to fight to ensure that they stand by that commitment. The American people are desperate for relief. We must answer their call and continue our efforts in Washington, and one way to do that, certainly, is to pass this conference report. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank my friend and partner, Mr. Pallone. We moved a majority of these bills [[Page H4560]] through the committee on a bipartisan basis. We had those votes here on the floor, a very strong vote as the process moved. Mr. Speaker, this bill is about treatment. It is about prevention. It is about recovery, helping law enforcement, particularly with our drug courts, and it adds new resources to help communities suffering from this terrible opioid epidemic. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act represents the most serious and comprehensive effort ever undertaken by this body to tackle the problem. CARA is a bipartisan blend of the best ideas from the House and the Senate. These bills passed with a combined 494 votes in the House and the Senate and, coupled with the great work led just this week by the House Appropriations Committee to add $581 million to help fund and prioritize these programs, it shows that we are tackling the problem head-on. Now, this is an authorization bill, not an appropriation bill. That is why, coupled with the appropriators, I think that we will get the job done. As I have said, at the end of the day, the money will be there. So those on the front lines fighting the opioid epidemic deserve a strong vote in the people's House. I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I just want to add my voice and thank Mr. Upton, as the chair of the conference, and Mr. Pallone, and all of the conferees, for what I thought was a significant historical moment. We have passed legislation, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, with no mandatory minimums. Our CARA bill speaks about grants, helping people overcome their addiction, but more importantly, helping communities. My community alone is suffering from something called Kush. That is not heroin, but all of these issues have to be confronted as a health epidemic. I thank the gentleman for accepting my amendment dealing with other drugs, about dealing with a public health epidemic, and I ask for support of the conference report. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the conference report for S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. The conference report is the product of a long process of consultation and hard work between Congress and experts and advocates representing a wide range of interests--including victims, addiction treatment specialists, and law enforcement. In many respects, this bill is a compromise--but it does reflect advances in our approach to substance addiction issues. As a Member of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic I have worked with my colleagues to come together with a comprehensive legislative package to address this national epidemic. I was an original cosponsor of the lead legislative measure and primary contribution of the House Judiciary Committee, H.R. 5046, the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, and I was a cosponsor of the predecessor bill, which is substantially similar to the Senate-passed version of S. 524. The text of H.R. 5046 is largely incorporated into the conference report, and would establish a grant program, to be administered by the Department of Justice, to assist states and local governments, particularly by helping criminal justice agencies to tackle the opioid problem from a variety of angles. It would encourage the development of alternatives to incarceration that provide treatment as a solution to the underlying motivation for criminal behavior or conduct associated with mental disorders. Combined with other treatment programs under the jurisdiction of other Committees, the approach Congress is taking with the crisis of heroin and other opioids is thoughtful and comprehensive. I hope it signals a departure from some of the failed approaches concerning other drug crises in the past. For instance, our response to the surge in crack cocaine in the 1980s was to enact draconian mandatory minimum penalties with vastly disparate treatment for crack and powder cocaine. At that time, Congress took action that we are still trying to rectify. At one point, more than 80 percent of the defendants sentenced for crack offenses were African American, despite the fact that more than 66 percent of crack users are white or Hispanic. As we work on other legislation to address the enforcement and sentencing disparities related to the crack issue, we must re-examine our approach to that and other drug issues. I am grateful for the assistance of my colleague, Bob Goodlatte, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for working with me to include in this bill my amendment to express the sense of the Congress that an effective and fiscally responsible approach to addressing substance abuse epidemics--no matter which drug is involved--requires treating such epidemics as a public health emergencies emphasizing prevention, treatment, and recovery. Provided in Section 708 of the Report, the Sense of Congress Regarding Treatment of Substance Abuse Epidemics expresses that decades of experience and research have demonstrated that a fiscally responsible approach to addressing the opioid abuse epidemic and other substance abuse epidemics requires treating such epidemics as a public health emergency emphasizing prevention, treatment and recovery. Indeed, we must adopt a public health approach with regard to substance abuse issues going forward. And I am heartened that, in this bill, we are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory minimums that add to mass incarceration, but we are supporting proven anti-addiction mechanisms. However, the conference committee had the opportunity to do even more--as is necessary given the urgency of the current crisis--and provide real money, right now, to implement the programs the bill authorizes. Unfortunately, this bill does not do that and our communities remain in dire need of resources to save lives that are in immediate jeopardy. That is the unfinished business of this effort and we must not rest until we have done all that we can in Congress to help protect our communities from opioid abuse. In contrast to the way we are dealing with the opioid crisis is the ill-advised strict ``law-enforcement'' centered approach Congress took in addressing crack cocaine crisis in the 1980s that that we are still trying to rectify. At one point, more than 80 percent of the defendants sentenced for crack offenses were African American, despite the fact that more than 66 percent of crack users are white or Hispanic. While we are now engaged in a comprehensive ``public health'' approach centered on public health in addressing the crisis involving heroin and other opioids, we must not forget that there is unfinished work to be done to address the enforcement and sentencing disparities related to the crack cocaine. We are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory minimums but we are funding anti-addiction mechanisms such as treatment alternatives to incarceration. We are not adding to mass incarceration--with all of the related and devastating collateral consequences--but instead we are incentivizing state and local governments to prevent, treat, and heal. That is what we should be doing, and that is what we should have done for crack and cocaine addicts. But it is not too late--we should find a way, before this Congress adjourns sine die to apply this more comprehensive approach, including treatment alternatives, to those suffering from crack and cocaine addiction. legislation supported by jackson lee 1.

I was very pleased to work with her on the successful amendment that we added in the conference as part of this agreement, and I look for its swift passage today. [[Page H4561]] I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report of S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA). Families devastated by opioid addiction deserve action, and this legislation will take some important steps to reduce the toll on our communities. None of our districts is immune to this epidemic that is causing so much death and heartache. The conference report includes elements from both the bipartisan House and Senate versions of their respective opioid measures recently approved almost unanimously. It includes provisions that incorporate prevention tactics and expanded access to treatment, recovery support services, and overdose reversals. Additionally, the report encourages criminal justice agencies to integrate and sustain Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) programs. Although this report includes vital and much needed measures, we cannot pretend that it will solve the problem. I am disappointed that this legislation does not include adequate funding to fully help us get ahead of this crisis. During conference, my Democratic colleagues from both chambers offered amendments that would provide funding for the authorizations within the package. Unfortunately, they were turned down, so we must continue to fight for the resources necessary to meaningfully implement this package. I request my colleagues to support this report and to continue to work on a bipartisan basis to provide the resources needed to save lives. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 809, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the conference report.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 809, I call up the conference report on the bill (S. 524) to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 809, the conference report is considered read. (For conference report and statement, see proceedings of the House of July 6, 2016, at page H4392.) The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the conference report to accompany S. 524. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The simple truth is that we are in the midst of a real epidemic. Nearly every 12 minutes, someone in America dies of a drug overdose. The CDC reports over a quarter billion opioid prescriptions were written in the year 2012. The abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin has impacted, virtually, every single community. It is an epidemic that has no boundaries and does not discriminate. In my State of Michigan, we are seeing 10 times as many deaths today as there were 15 years ago. Sadly, the number continues to surge; but behind every statistic is a person who was loved, part of a family and community, and, yes, who was lost too soon. {time} 1045 It is a frightening reality, but we have to face this epidemic head on, and today's vote is an important step forward. Since the beginning of this process, our focus has been, and continues to be, on attacking this public health crisis from every side, from zeroing in on treatment for addiction and overdoses to reforming prescription practices in the delivery of medicines and working with law enforcement of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Specifically, this conference report addresses prevention care by requiring HHS to create an interagency task force to address chronic and pain management care and by reauthorizing NASPER, a piece of legislation the House has passed with very large bipartisan support. The conference report addresses treatment by ensuring opioid reversal medication is accessible to patients, their family members and, yes, first responders as well. These medications are key to stopping the overdose epidemic and getting these patients into proper treatment to become productive members of our society. The conference report also ensures proper oversight and accountability by including the majority leader's OPEN Act. The conference report, as a whole, touches on the spectrum of issues driving the opioid crisis. While there is no one solution, we are making progress in addressing a problem that has rapidly grown. So I want to thank all my colleagues--certainly on the Energy and Commerce Committee that I chair and those off--for working to advance these important bipartisan bills that will make a real difference in our communities. I am also proud that our final package has achieved the support of over 200 of the Nation's leading advocacy groups, groups from across the country that are focused on recovery. These advocates are on the front lines in this epidemic and truly appreciate the positive impact that our solutions will have in every community. There is an urgency to our work as drug overdose deaths surge in Michigan and beyond. We owe this effort to the past, present, and, sadly, future victims of the opioid epidemic; our neighbors, friends, family across every part of the family in every demographic group. So let's come together and get the job done. What we are doing will save lives. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. After much thought, I have decided to support the conference report on S. 524. It is not perfect and does not nearly do enough from a funding perspective, but it makes some important steps that would allow us to begin to address the opioid addiction crisis that is impacting our Nation. The American people are desperate for relief from the opioid epidemic currently devastating our country, and they are depending on this Congress to act. By now, we have all heard the stories: young people taken from their families in their prime; babies born suffering from the cruel effects of opioid withdrawal; and parents who have lost the ability to care for their families as they battle their addiction. To treat this epidemic as anything less than a national crisis would be a terrible mistake. And even though we have already lost far too many lives to overdoses, we still have an opportunity to save many more. This conference report includes many important policies that have bipartisan agreement. For example, we will now allow patients and doctors to choose to partially fill their opioids so that excess medicines are not dispensed unnecessarily. This will reduce the number of unused pills in circulation, which will reduce the risk of misuse, diversion, and overdose. The conference report also allows nurse practitioners and physician assistants to treat individuals with [[Page H4555]] opioid use disorders with buprenorphine. This final report also includes important and proven programs to address prevention, treatment, and recovery; but just changing policies alone won't be enough. This legislation takes only a small step at a time when the American people need us to run. Mr. Speaker, how can we truly help the American people without giving them the resources to fight this epidemic? We cannot wait while lives continue to be destroyed by opiate addiction and while treatment options remain out of reach. Congressional Democrats, Mr. Speaker, have long advocated for more funding in this package and have even proposed bipartisan policies to offset the cost, but Republicans have stubbornly refused to commit essential funding as part of this overall bill. Time and again they have rejected efforts to make a real difference by going beyond the important policy changes in this bill and actually supporting significant funding to properly take on this growing national epidemic today. Instead, Republicans have committed to increasing funding through the appropriations process, and we will certainly make sure that they live up to the repeated promises they have made in this regard. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this conference report to S. 524. This conference report is one of the proudest moments I have had as an elected Member of this body. I believe there are numerous challenges that our community healthcare providers face, and this bill helps them address those challenges. As a lifelong pharmacist, I believe the key first steps to address this opioid epidemic is education, improvement of treatment, and a reliance on State PDMP programs. This bill does all of that. Many of my colleagues have opposed this conference report and this bill because it does not authorize enough money or it doesn't provide every provision they want. There are things that I would have changed in this bill, but we have all had an opportunity to amend these provisions, and this has created a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation. Overall, this should not be the end of this conversation, but this bill is a good bill and addresses many of the problems Americans face with opioid addiction. I would like to commend leadership from both Chambers on this bill, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind). Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. There is no question that we have an opiate epidemic sweeping our communities throughout Wisconsin and the rest of the Nation. I spent the better part of the last year holding listening sessions back home in my congressional district in western and north central Wisconsin, getting feedback from law enforcement, healthcare providers, treatment centers, and families that have been impacted by drug addiction and the opioid addiction to ensure that this legislation that we have pending before us today doesn't get too far out ahead of what they actually need. There are a lot of good policy changes in this bill, but one thing that is lacking that the gentleman also pointed out is the resource aspect of this. They do need tools. They do need additional resources. I am hoping that later in the year, whether it is through a continuing resolution or the funding of these operations, that we can find in a bipartisan way the increase of necessary resources for folks back home so that they can get out ahead of this curve and do an adequate job of turning the trend line away. I am also supportive because the legislation before us contains the Jason Simcakoski PROMISE Act. Jason Simcakoski was a veteran who died at the Tomah VA Medical Center a couple of years ago due to an opioid drug overdose. We have, in this legislation, a continuation of reforms that are being implemented to ensure that all of our veterans, whether in Wisconsin or throughout the Nation, are getting the care and the treatment they need; that we continue down the road of revamping the pain management practices at places like Tomah. I am confident that with the provisions in here, if we do this the right way, that Tomah and the VA system could be a model of proper pain management practices not just within the VA system, but throughout the entire healthcare system. There is no question we haven't done a good job of managing pain as a nation. That is true of whether it is in the VA. It is true whether it is in the private health sector. This legislation before us today gives us an opportunity to continue down that road and do a much better job. The Jason Simcakoski Act, for instance, will call for clinical practice guidelines to be instituted throughout the entire VA system. It enhances pain management education and training for our healthcare providers. It improves realtime tracking and access to data on opioid usage. It also expands opiate safety initiatives throughout all the VA centers. It expands the patient advocacy program, which is particularly important because I think the families are the first line of defense when it comes to the care and treatment of all our veterans. They know what is working and what isn't. They need greater input and better lines of communication to help affect the course of treatment that is impacting the veterans in their life. It also calls on the VA to explore more complimentary and alternative forms of medicine to deal with pain management so we are not just loading our veterans up with a cocktail of prescription drugs, which oftentimes lead to addiction which can lead to meth and heroin usage. I also think that this legislation gives us an opportunity to establish that strong partnership that needs to exist at the Federal, State, and local level, including private entities, so we can do a better job on the opioid addiction problem throughout our Nation. This is an all-hands-on-deck moment. As a former special prosecutor who had to deal in the criminal system with a lot of it, our response cannot just be a criminal justice response. It has to be a public health response or we lose this battle going into it. I think this legislation does provide crucial tools to help us make that pivot, but we also need the crucial resources; and that is something that we are going to have to address as this year progresses. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. I appreciate the hard work that the committees and those involved have put into this legislation. But it will be a work in progress, and we have to continue to listen to the folks on the ground back home to ensure that they are getting the help and support that they need. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Chairman Upton's leadership and partnership throughout this important effort. Today is a proud day in our Nation's history. Today the House will complete its work on a comprehensive legislative package to combat the terrible epidemic of opioid abuse, which is ravaging our country. We have all heard the grim statistics. 129 people die every day from drug overdose. That is more than 47,000 a year. These people are our neighbors, friends, and loved ones. They come from all walks of life and all communities. They need our help. Today, the House is answering the call. The conference report we are considering today represents a truly comprehensive response to the opioid epidemic. It includes provisions from 18 bills passed by the House in May and addresses all facets of the epidemic. It permits the government to make grants for purposes of prevention, treatment and recovery, overdose reversal through the use of FDA-approved and appropriately labeled drugs and devices, and law enforcement and investigative purposes. Significantly, the conference report preserves the provisions of the Judiciary Committee's flagship bill, H.R. [[Page H4556]] 5046, which passed this House in May by an overwhelming 413-5 vote. This historic legislation, which was sponsored by Crime Subcommittee Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner, creates a comprehensive Justice Department grant program to help States fight opioid addiction. It authorizes $103 million annually over 5 years for the grant program. It directs precious taxpayer dollars responsibly by leveraging and streamlining existing programs, and it is fully offsetting the legislation in compliance with the House's CutGo proposal. The conference report authorizes this funding for a wide variety of anti-opioid activities, including drug courts which have proven to be highly successful and which I support. In fact, it is my expectation, Mr. Speaker, that drug courts will continue to receive funding levels in future years similar to current funding levels. In addition to H.R. 5046, this conference report contains provisions from three other Judiciary Committee bills, including H.R. 5052, the OPEN Act, which increases the transparency and accountability of the comprehensive opioid abuse grant program in H.R. 5046; H.R. 4985, the Kingpin Designation Improvement Act, which protects classified information from disclosure when a drug kingpin challenges his designation as such in a Federal court; and H.R. 5048, the Good Samaritan Assessment Act, which requires the GAO to study State and local Good Samaritan laws that protect caregivers, law enforcement personnel, and first responders who administer opioid overdose reversal drugs or devices from criminal or civil liability, as well as those who contact emergency service providers in response to an overdose. In addition, the Judiciary Committee moved as part of this package S. 32, the Transnational Drug Trafficking Act. That legislation, which has already been signed into law, improves law enforcement's ability to pursue international drug manufacturers, brokers, and distributors in source nations. Federal prosecutors can now use the important tools in that bill to pursue foreign drug traffickers who are poisoning American citizens. Along with the excellent legislation prepared by our sister committees, spearheaded by Chairmen Upton, Miller, and Kline, these bills make substantial policy changes within the Federal agencies responsible for fighting addiction. They take real steps to address the opioid epidemic and provide real relief for a real problem affecting real Americans. Members of this body should be proud of these accomplishments. {time} 1100 I would like to stress, Mr. Speaker, that opposition to this conference report on the basis of funding is wrong and misguided. As I stated, this legislation authorizes $103 million just for Justice Department programs. Under the leadership of Chairmen Rogers, Culberson, Cole, Crenshaw, and Dent, the House Committee on Appropriations has responded admirably to this epidemic by allocating hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for these programs. The CJS appropriations bill contains $103 million in funding for the DOJ program. The Labor/HHS bill, released Wednesday, contains $581 million to address opioid and heroin abuse, which is above even the President's budget request. The Financial Services and General Government bill has funded High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas and Drug-Free Communities Support Programs at record highs. Nobody can come to this floor and credibly claim that the House is not putting its money where its mouth is. I thank my colleagues for their support and hard work. Yesterday we received a letter signed by 233 addiction stakeholder groups, endorsing the conference report to S. 524. I urge everyone to support this conference report. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his excellent work in bringing this bipartisan legislation to the floor. With all due respect to Mr. Goodlatte, I credibly come to the floor to say that this bill does not provide the funding that we need to address the opioid crisis in our country. I thank Mr. Upton again. I know this is his last year as chairman of the committee. I thank him for his openness, his willingness to work in a bipartisan way, and I do think that this is a good piece of legislation. It is lacking one thing: the resources to get the job done. I also come to the floor as an appropriator, and to hear Mr. Goodlatte say what is coming out of here and coming out of there, in our subcommittee on Labor/HHS, we call it the lamb-eat-lamb committee because there was no good place to take money from. We had carefully and economically husbanded the resources in such a way, when we did budget agreements, to use the money very well for its purposes: the investments in education and health, et cetera. So when an emergency comes along like the opioid epidemic, like Zika, like Flint, these are emergencies, and by tradition, this House has always declared emergencies--whether a natural disaster or otherwise-- to say that funding would not be lamb-eat-lamb within the appropriations process and take funds from very needed initiatives that Congress had agreed to in our own authorizations otherwise. So it had been my intention for us to come to the floor to oppose this bill to be able to sustain a Presidential veto until there would be resources. But in the spirit of this day, we come to the floor instead to say let's move the process along, but let's also say that there are other issues, like opioids, and Zika, and Flint that we really have to address in the near term. The opioid epidemic, as it has been said by the distinguished chairman and ranking member and others, is such an important challenge to the well-being of our country. While you may say Flint is in Michigan and Zika is down south, the fact is they affect all of us. But opioids are right there in all of our communities, and all of the Members of Congress immediately see the need for the authorization but also for the funding. The opioid conference report includes many important authorizing provisions in a bipartisan way, but it does not include the new funds that are essential to saving lives from opioids. Around a dozen law enforcement people were at the White House yesterday talking about the opioid epidemic. Many people outside of the Congress support the principles in this bill. But do you know that some of those law enforcement officials are having separate fundraisers of their own in order to help people address their opioid challenge? We are just not living up to our responsibility in a timely fashion. Within the next week, hopefully, we will leave with some additional funding. The President has asked for $1.1 billion to address the problem. The distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary says that the appropriators are putting more than that in certain cases in opioids; but if they are taking it out of other priorities, other investments in the health and well-being and the security of the American people, we are doing this at the expense of other good investments. We will not stop fighting until America's families have the prevention, treatment, and recovery resources they need to overcome the opioid epidemic, and that is why for today, although the votes are there to sustain a Presidential veto, we don't encourage that. We encourage our cooperation today with the hope and the promise that Mr. Rogers, whom we all respect--I served with him on Appropriations-- and Mrs. Lowey can come to terms in a way that does not have the opioid epidemic funded at the expense of other investments important to the American people. It is a priority. It is an emergency. In other cases we have had emergency spending for just that. When we do budget agreements, as we did last year--very difficult staying under the caps and the rest--it was not with the idea that there would be a $1.1 billion need for opioids or $1.9 billion need for Zika funding or there wouldn't be hundreds of millions of dollars for Flint. These are extraordinary emergencies. They should be treated that way. Nonetheless, I congratulate Mr. Upton and Mr. Pallone and all who had a role in putting this legislation together. I hope that it is just a first [[Page H4557]] step that in the very, very near future we will have money to match the values that are contained in this legislation. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 21 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 22\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, a partner in this effort from day one. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I would briefly like to discuss with my friend and partner in this effort, the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, how the conference report encourages innovation by allowing alternative therapies to qualify for funding while also requiring evaluation and reporting on the effectiveness of all authorized programs. In my district, some nonprofit organizations are using animal- assisted psychotherapy to successfully address mental health and personal development needs, including for veterans, and animals have also helped prison inmates achieve life-changing developments. It is my understanding that these and other alternative therapies are eligible for funding under the grant programs contained in the conference report. And I would ask the gentleman from Michigan: Is that your understanding as well? Mr. UPTON. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. UPTON. Absolutely is the answer, yes. Section 601, the State demonstration grants for comprehensive opioid abuse response, is designed to allow States the flexibility to do what is right and aid in establishing a comprehensive response. Under this grant, we emphasize prevention and treatment, but those are not the only two ways to address the opioid epidemic. Recovery, like the good work that Chairman Goodlatte cited in his district, as it is in mine, is equally as important. We need a comprehensive response to the crisis that should leave no stone unturned in our quest for helping those in need. I want to thank the chairman for his help in that effort, and I absolutely agree with his reading of the bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues argue that we will pass this authorization bill today, and then sometime down the line we will provide funding through the regular appropriations process. But the problem is that that response does not match the urgency of the crisis. To understand why, let's just take a quick look at the 2016 appropriations process. While the fiscal year 2016 began on October 1, 2015, the omnibus fiscal year 2016 appropriations act did not become law until December 18, 2015. If, as expected, the fiscal year 2017 process is similar, it will be at least 6 months before we can provide funding through the fiscal year 2017 appropriations process; and that is 6 months in which more people will die from potentially preventable overdose deaths and more individuals and families in need of treatment options will be unable to access them. There is also no guarantee that additional funds will be made available through the appropriations process. The fiscal austerity policies of my Republican colleagues also make this option untenable. Due to the sequestration caps demanded by the Republicans, an increase in spending for one program can only occur with the cutting of funding for another program. While the Republicans will say they introduced a Labor/HHS bill with $500 million in funding for a comprehensive State grant program for substance abuse treatment, what they don't say is that to provide that funding, we will have to agree to cut funding for other critical programs. The Republican Labor/HHS appropriations bill proposes eliminating funding for ObamaCare, title X family planning services, education programs, and employment training and development programs. Not only are these cuts objectionable, we don't have to make such choices. We have bipartisan pay-fors available to offset the direct appropriations of funding now, and we cannot afford to wait. So this is truly an urgent crisis, and we should treat it as such by providing critical funding immediately. Failure to act will unacceptably lead to more deaths, and our communities cannot afford to wait any longer. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a fellow conferee and member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this conference report. It is a great step forward in the fight against the scourge of drug addiction. I was proud to serve on the conference committee that crafted this package, and I thank Chairman Upton and Chairman Grassley for their tremendous leadership on the issue. This measure includes language that I authored with my Democratic colleague, Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney of the Hudson Valley in New York State, that targets opioid addiction's strong ties to prescription drug abuse and the issue of overprescription. It is one part of a comprehensive plan that will make serious progress on this challenge that strains law enforcement and taxpayer resources and cuts too many lives tragically short. This package comes the same week we secured passage of a landmark overhaul of our Nation's mental health care system. These are major priorities of the American people, and this is how Congress should work, gaining ideas and insight from the constituencies across the Nation and working together in a bipartisan fashion to address the important issues confronting the United States. On this very sad day, given the horrific events in Dallas last night, we are reminded that a great many issues face our country. I hope the spirit of cooperation that secured this week's productivity will guide us on the other challenges we face as a nation. I want to work on what unites us in the United States and on the priorities of all Americans. This conference report is one of those priorities, and I urge a ``yes'' vote. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as I said before, this conference report does include important and proven programs to address prevention, treatment, and recovery with regard to opioid abuse, and I did want to mention a few. There is authorization to create a grant program for eligible entities to promote the prescribing of opioid reversal drugs, naloxone, in conjunction with opiates for patients at an elevated risk of overdose. There is a program to reauthorize SAMHSA grants for the funding of residential treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorders. There is a demonstration grant program to States to streamline State requirements and procedures in order to assist veterans who have completed military emergency medical technician training to meet requirements for becoming an emergency medical technician in the State. There is also a State grant program to increase the implementation of standing orders for opioid overdose reversal medication, again, naloxone. As I have said before, there are a number of very important programs here that authorize grants to States to deal with the prevention, treatment, and recovery from opioids. But, again, these programs will not be effective without some significant funding provided pursuant to those authorizations. So I want to stress, again, as Democrats, we support this bill because it does have authorization for many programs that will help with opioid addiction, but we need to hold the Republicans' feet to the fire to make sure that this funding is actually provided. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1115 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan), a fellow conferee and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. [[Page H4558]] Mr. MEEHAN. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this important bill. Mr. Speaker, the statistics are staggering. We are losing 120 a people a day to opioid abuse. Earlier this year, southeastern Pennsylvania lost an accomplished young man, John Decker, who succumbed to his battle with addiction. As a teenager, John injured his knee playing basketball. His physician prescribed opioids to manage the pain after surgery. John became addicted to the painkillers and moved on to using heroin. I introduced the John Thomas Decker Act with the goal of preventing injured youth and adolescent athletes from getting addicted to opioids and turning to heroin. But I use John's name because it is not about statistics; it is to demonstrate that we are talking about real people and struggling families here. The legislation, which is included in section 104 of the conference report, directs the United States Department of Health and Human Services to study what information and resources are available to youth athletes and their families regarding the dangers of opioid use and abuse, nonopioid treatment options, and how to seek addiction treatment. The Department must report its findings and work with stakeholders to disseminate resources to students, parents, and those involved in treating sports injuries, and that is how this can work together with things that are already happening in the community. I want to acknowledge what is going on in communities all across the country. Just last week, I visited Adapt Pharma, a constituent company, in Radnor, Pennsylvania. The company makes a Narcan nasal spray and is providing the antidote to high schools. Adapt Pharma and the National Association of School Nurses are working together to ensure that educational materials are available to students and their families about prescription drug abuse as well as treatment and recovery options that will work perfectly in tandem with this particular section. So, whether you are young athletes, pregnant mothers, struggling veterans, or suffering families, so many are going to be helped. I urge my colleagues to stand with the families who have suffered the effects of addiction and support the conference report. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the dean of the House and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, the crisis of opioid abuse and addiction clearly requires our immediate attention. I believe that that is now happening. I am grateful for the tireless work of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. I thank Chairman Goodlatte; Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee chairman, Jim Sensenbrenner; Crime Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee ranking member, Sheila Jackson Lee; and their staffs. And I also congratulate Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, who worked so hard to ensure this bill would find promising approaches to opioid abuse that were pioneered in her district. Finally, I wish to thank the ranking member, Frank Pallone of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and his staff for their assistance and coordination in this effort. Our work has focused on the need to address an urgent crisis. In my State of Michigan, there were 1,745 drug overdoses in the year 2014, and more than half of those overdose deaths were caused by opioids and heroin. Each day, 78 Americans die from an opioid overdose. Fortunately, we now have a better way of addressing issues of addiction, and we know that incarceration is not the answer. For instance, the Judiciary Committee's Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee held a hearing last year that examined, among other things, the promising use of the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion approach employed in cities such as Seattle, Washington, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. We know that there are effective ways to get addicts to treatment and to quickly provide them with needed services that address their addiction and prevent recidivism, and we know that evidence-based treatment and alternatives to incarceration work. Title II of this bill reflects much of this approach in the grant program, as reported by the Judiciary Committee and passed by the House in May of this year. While I have supported this effort, I have also supported alternative approaches that provide separate grant programs for many of these worthy purposes. Regardless of which approach we take, we must do more than simply authorize funding. We must provide real dollars that are urgently needed by those fighting this crisis, and I am disappointed that this bill does not do this. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great State of Michigan (Mr. Trott), a fellow conferee. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the conference report that we are considering today. And as my colleague, Mr. Conyers, just mentioned, 1,745 individuals died of a drug overdose in Michigan in 2014, and 449 of those individuals were in my home district in Oakland and Wayne Counties. So a disproportionate number of people were affected. As has been mentioned, this bill contains some good solutions toward fighting this epidemic: a comprehensive grant program, changes to existing law, and some new programs to help end the tragedies. Some have suggested, however, that our response is inadequate or too small of a step to fight this problem. I disagree. Let me say to those people who are listening, particularly those who have suffered from addiction or lost a loved one through the tragedy of an overdose, that Republicans and Democrats and the President recognize this epidemic. We are united in our commitment to defeat the abuse and tragedy. We in Congress will revisit our programs and solutions and the money we are spending to make sure that they are making a difference, and we will revisit the solutions and make sure that adequate resources are in place so we can end the terrible drug abuse and heroin overdoses that are affecting our communities. I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to serve on the conference committee. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to stress that President Obama recently announced additional actions to expand access to treatment, strengthen prescription drug monitoring, enable safe disposal of unneeded drugs, and accelerate research on pain and opioid misuse and overdose. The President, I think, has made it clear that addressing this epidemic is a priority for his administration. While Federal agencies have been using their authority to take every available action they can, Congress needs to provide additional funding to make lifesaving treatment available to everyone who needs it. The President has called for $1.1 billion in new funding to help Americans who want treatment wherever they live. Every day that passes without congressional action to provide these additional resources is a missed opportunity to get treatment to those who want it, help prevent overdoses, and support communities across the country impacted by this epidemic. Recovery from opioid and other substance use disorders is possible, and many Americans are able to recover because they get the treatment and care they need. But too many still are not able to get treatment. That is why the President has called on Congress to provide the resources needed to ensure that every American with an opioid use disorder who wants treatment can get it and start on the road to recovery. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), also a conferee and a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. We all have experienced the opioid epidemic in some way, whether it is through family, friends, or heartbreaking stories from constituents back home. [[Page H4559]] Opioid addiction is prevalent in our veteran community, and I am proud many of my provisions to help our heroes were included in this legislation. I want to thank the chairman for including those provisions in this particular conference report. My bills, the PROMISE Act and COVER Act, will update the clinical practice guidelines used to treat our servicemembers for pain management and provide a pathway forward to implement complementary and integrative health alternatives within the VA. With this bill, we can help our struggling heroes and others battling addiction across the Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on each side. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 14 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Michigan has 14\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), my partner in terms of a contiguous border and also a conferee. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This vital bill will help address the prescription drug epidemic we have seen plague our communities for so long. Dozens of Americans die each day from prescription drug overdoses. This has to stop. It is time for us to come together as a nation to tackle the issue that has infected every fabric of our society. I am very honored to have served on this conference committee for the bill, and I am thankful it is being considered today by the House. As a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have seen the opioid epidemic's effects on our Nation's veterans. Veterans are more vulnerable to chronic pain, more susceptible to addiction, but some VA facilities still overprescribe these powerful drugs. I have seen the problem firsthand with veterans coming into my office, often carrying a large box or bag of pills. In my home State of Indiana, the DEA raided the VA Medical Center in Marion after noticing the volume of narcotics and opioids purchased by the facility. For too long, the VA has relied too heavily on opioids to treat chronic pain. This bill addresses that by requiring the VA and the DOD to focus on improving their prescribing practices. It includes my piece of legislation requiring the VA to report to State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs, which are important and effective tools for stopping overprescription. It also allows the VA to consider nonopioid treatments for veterans with chronic pain. Mr. Speaker, there is a long battle ahead of us--we have got a long way to go, and a lot of damage has been done--but this bill represents an important step forward as we seek to stop overprescription and opioid addiction in our country. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters). Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, across the United States, we are faced with a substance abuse epidemic that results in overdose, addiction, and far too many deaths. From opioids to heroin, no community--not even Orange County, the place that I have called home for over 50 years--is immune. Last year, the number of deaths in Orange County caused by drug overdose rose to 400, the highest level in at least a decade. More than two-thirds of these untimely deaths involved opioids. Nationwide, nearly 130 people die every single day from drug abuse. Though this is a nationwide epidemic, there is not a one-size-fits- all cure to addiction. That is why this legislation is so important. I thank all of my colleagues who have worked so intently on these lifesaving policies. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure so that we can send it to the President's desk. As soon as this law is implemented, it will save lives and help Americans suffering from addiction reclaim their lives. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to again point out that the effort here is not only bipartisan, but we are also working with the administration to try to address this epidemic. And one of the things that we were trying to do with the legislation, but it became unnecessary because of the President's executive action, was with regard to bup. {time} 1130 This is a painkiller, if you will, that is used as an alternative to the addictive painkillers that cause the opiate problem. And until recently, under the law, a physician could only have up to 100 patients to whom he was administering bup, but now, in the last week or so, the President announced that that cap has been lifted to 275. Now, in the legislation, we do expand the types of providers who can treat opioid dependence using bup, but, at the same time, it was necessary, I believe, to raise that cap because there is a waiting list--a rather extensive waiting list--for people who would like to take advantage of bup. So I just wanted to say that that is one of the most important things that actually was done by the President. And it is very important for us to work together not only in terms of what we authorize, but also providing the funding for many of these programs, both what we are now authorizing pursuant to grants in this legislation, as well as what the administration is doing through agency action. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus). Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I commend the chairman, the ranking member, the conferees, on this work that they have accomplished. The opioid and heroin epidemic has hit western Pennsylvania hard. Nothing brings this crisis into sharper focus than when you are speaking with a parent who has lost a child, or a family member watching a loved one go through revolving doors of treatment and still be slipping away. This conference report has been a bipartisan, all-hands-on-deck effort reflective of the collaboration we see happening at the grassroots of our communities. I am pleased to see the conference report include the provision my colleague from across the aisle, Congressman Keating, and I championed in the House legislation to establish coprescribing guidelines for overdose antidotes such as naloxone. I am also pleased with how this legislation gives the proper focus to our veterans. This conference report is a necessary step in moving forward to address this crisis. Let us continue to work together to combat this deadly scourge. I urge its passage. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Again, Mr. Speaker, I will say that, after thoughtful consideration, I not only support the conference report, but I would urge my colleagues on the Democratic side to support the conference report. While I continue to believe that we cannot turn the tide on this epidemic without dedicated additional resources for States, the underlying policies included in this bill are important steps forward. As you know, Democratic conferees, along with the Democratic leadership, have worked tirelessly these past few weeks to try to include money for States to help treat our communities who are suffering. Republicans still, so far, refuse to commit the essential funding as part of this overall bill, but they have committed to increasing funding through the appropriations process, and I will continue to fight to ensure that they stand by that commitment. The American people are desperate for relief. We must answer their call and continue our efforts in Washington, and one way to do that, certainly, is to pass this conference report. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank my friend and partner, Mr. Pallone. We moved a majority of these bills [[Page H4560]] through the committee on a bipartisan basis. We had those votes here on the floor, a very strong vote as the process moved. Mr. Speaker, this bill is about treatment. It is about prevention. It is about recovery, helping law enforcement, particularly with our drug courts, and it adds new resources to help communities suffering from this terrible opioid epidemic. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act represents the most serious and comprehensive effort ever undertaken by this body to tackle the problem. CARA is a bipartisan blend of the best ideas from the House and the Senate. These bills passed with a combined 494 votes in the House and the Senate and, coupled with the great work led just this week by the House Appropriations Committee to add $581 million to help fund and prioritize these programs, it shows that we are tackling the problem head-on. Now, this is an authorization bill, not an appropriation bill. That is why, coupled with the appropriators, I think that we will get the job done. As I have said, at the end of the day, the money will be there. So those on the front lines fighting the opioid epidemic deserve a strong vote in the people's House. I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I just want to add my voice and thank Mr. Upton, as the chair of the conference, and Mr. Pallone, and all of the conferees, for what I thought was a significant historical moment. We have passed legislation, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, with no mandatory minimums. Our CARA bill speaks about grants, helping people overcome their addiction, but more importantly, helping communities. My community alone is suffering from something called Kush. That is not heroin, but all of these issues have to be confronted as a health epidemic. I thank the gentleman for accepting my amendment dealing with other drugs, about dealing with a public health epidemic, and I ask for support of the conference report. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the conference report for S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. The conference report is the product of a long process of consultation and hard work between Congress and experts and advocates representing a wide range of interests--including victims, addiction treatment specialists, and law enforcement. In many respects, this bill is a compromise--but it does reflect advances in our approach to substance addiction issues. As a Member of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic I have worked with my colleagues to come together with a comprehensive legislative package to address this national epidemic. I was an original cosponsor of the lead legislative measure and primary contribution of the House Judiciary Committee, H.R. 5046, the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, and I was a cosponsor of the predecessor bill, which is substantially similar to the Senate-passed version of S. 524. The text of H.R. 5046 is largely incorporated into the conference report, and would establish a grant program, to be administered by the Department of Justice, to assist states and local governments, particularly by helping criminal justice agencies to tackle the opioid problem from a variety of angles. It would encourage the development of alternatives to incarceration that provide treatment as a solution to the underlying motivation for criminal behavior or conduct associated with mental disorders. Combined with other treatment programs under the jurisdiction of other Committees, the approach Congress is taking with the crisis of heroin and other opioids is thoughtful and comprehensive. I hope it signals a departure from some of the failed approaches concerning other drug crises in the past. For instance, our response to the surge in crack cocaine in the 1980s was to enact draconian mandatory minimum penalties with vastly disparate treatment for crack and powder cocaine. At that time, Congress took action that we are still trying to rectify. At one point, more than 80 percent of the defendants sentenced for crack offenses were African American, despite the fact that more than 66 percent of crack users are white or Hispanic. As we work on other legislation to address the enforcement and sentencing disparities related to the crack issue, we must re-examine our approach to that and other drug issues. I am grateful for the assistance of my colleague, Bob Goodlatte, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for working with me to include in this bill my amendment to express the sense of the Congress that an effective and fiscally responsible approach to addressing substance abuse epidemics--no matter which drug is involved--requires treating such epidemics as a public health emergencies emphasizing prevention, treatment, and recovery. Provided in Section 708 of the Report, the Sense of Congress Regarding Treatment of Substance Abuse Epidemics expresses that decades of experience and research have demonstrated that a fiscally responsible approach to addressing the opioid abuse epidemic and other substance abuse epidemics requires treating such epidemics as a public health emergency emphasizing prevention, treatment and recovery. Indeed, we must adopt a public health approach with regard to substance abuse issues going forward. And I am heartened that, in this bill, we are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory minimums that add to mass incarceration, but we are supporting proven anti-addiction mechanisms. However, the conference committee had the opportunity to do even more--as is necessary given the urgency of the current crisis--and provide real money, right now, to implement the programs the bill authorizes. Unfortunately, this bill does not do that and our communities remain in dire need of resources to save lives that are in immediate jeopardy. That is the unfinished business of this effort and we must not rest until we have done all that we can in Congress to help protect our communities from opioid abuse. In contrast to the way we are dealing with the opioid crisis is the ill-advised strict ``law-enforcement'' centered approach Congress took in addressing crack cocaine crisis in the 1980s that that we are still trying to rectify. At one point, more than 80 percent of the defendants sentenced for crack offenses were African American, despite the fact that more than 66 percent of crack users are white or Hispanic. While we are now engaged in a comprehensive ``public health'' approach centered on public health in addressing the crisis involving heroin and other opioids, we must not forget that there is unfinished work to be done to address the enforcement and sentencing disparities related to the crack cocaine. We are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory minimums but we are funding anti-addiction mechanisms such as treatment alternatives to incarceration. We are not adding to mass incarceration--with all of the related and devastating collateral consequences--but instead we are incentivizing state and local governments to prevent, treat, and heal. That is what we should be doing, and that is what we should have done for crack and cocaine addicts. But it is not too late--we should find a way, before this Congress adjourns sine die to apply this more comprehensive approach, including treatment alternatives, to those suffering from crack and cocaine addiction. legislation supported by jackson lee 1.

I was very pleased to work with her on the successful amendment that we added in the conference as part of this agreement, and I look for its swift passage today. [[Page H4561]] I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report of S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA). Families devastated by opioid addiction deserve action, and this legislation will take some important steps to reduce the toll on our communities. None of our districts is immune to this epidemic that is causing so much death and heartache. The conference report includes elements from both the bipartisan House and Senate versions of their respective opioid measures recently approved almost unanimously. It includes provisions that incorporate prevention tactics and expanded access to treatment, recovery support services, and overdose reversals. Additionally, the report encourages criminal justice agencies to integrate and sustain Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) programs. Although this report includes vital and much needed measures, we cannot pretend that it will solve the problem. I am disappointed that this legislation does not include adequate funding to fully help us get ahead of this crisis. During conference, my Democratic colleagues from both chambers offered amendments that would provide funding for the authorizations within the package. Unfortunately, they were turned down, so we must continue to fight for the resources necessary to meaningfully implement this package. I request my colleagues to support this report and to continue to work on a bipartisan basis to provide the resources needed to save lives. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 809, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the conference report.

Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, on rollcall No. 399, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I was not present for rollcall vote No. 399 on agreeing to the Conference Report on S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yes.'' ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [House] [Pages H4554-H4561] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. 524, COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2016 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 809, I call up the conference report on the bill (S. 524) to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 809, the conference report is considered read. (For conference report and statement, see proceedings of the House of July 6, 2016, at page H4392.) The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the conference report to accompany S. 524. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The simple truth is that we are in the midst of a real epidemic. Nearly every 12 minutes, someone in America dies of a drug overdose. The CDC reports over a quarter billion opioid prescriptions were written in the year 2012. The abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin has impacted, virtually, every single community. It is an epidemic that has no boundaries and does not discriminate. In my State of Michigan, we are seeing 10 times as many deaths today as there were 15 years ago. Sadly, the number continues to surge; but behind every statistic is a person who was loved, part of a family and community, and, yes, who was lost too soon. {time} 1045 It is a frightening reality, but we have to face this epidemic head on, and today's vote is an important step forward. Since the beginning of this process, our focus has been, and continues to be, on attacking this public health crisis from every side, from zeroing in on treatment for addiction and overdoses to reforming prescription practices in the delivery of medicines and working with law enforcement of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Specifically, this conference report addresses prevention care by requiring HHS to create an interagency task force to address chronic and pain management care and by reauthorizing NASPER, a piece of legislation the House has passed with very large bipartisan support. The conference report addresses treatment by ensuring opioid reversal medication is accessible to patients, their family members and, yes, first responders as well. These medications are key to stopping the overdose epidemic and getting these patients into proper treatment to become productive members of our society. The conference report also ensures proper oversight and accountability by including the majority leader's OPEN Act. The conference report, as a whole, touches on the spectrum of issues driving the opioid crisis. While there is no one solution, we are making progress in addressing a problem that has rapidly grown. So I want to thank all my colleagues--certainly on the Energy and Commerce Committee that I chair and those off--for working to advance these important bipartisan bills that will make a real difference in our communities. I am also proud that our final package has achieved the support of over 200 of the Nation's leading advocacy groups, groups from across the country that are focused on recovery. These advocates are on the front lines in this epidemic and truly appreciate the positive impact that our solutions will have in every community. There is an urgency to our work as drug overdose deaths surge in Michigan and beyond. We owe this effort to the past, present, and, sadly, future victims of the opioid epidemic; our neighbors, friends, family across every part of the family in every demographic group. So let's come together and get the job done. What we are doing will save lives. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. After much thought, I have decided to support the conference report on S. 524. It is not perfect and does not nearly do enough from a funding perspective, but it makes some important steps that would allow us to begin to address the opioid addiction crisis that is impacting our Nation. The American people are desperate for relief from the opioid epidemic currently devastating our country, and they are depending on this Congress to act. By now, we have all heard the stories: young people taken from their families in their prime; babies born suffering from the cruel effects of opioid withdrawal; and parents who have lost the ability to care for their families as they battle their addiction. To treat this epidemic as anything less than a national crisis would be a terrible mistake. And even though we have already lost far too many lives to overdoses, we still have an opportunity to save many more. This conference report includes many important policies that have bipartisan agreement. For example, we will now allow patients and doctors to choose to partially fill their opioids so that excess medicines are not dispensed unnecessarily. This will reduce the number of unused pills in circulation, which will reduce the risk of misuse, diversion, and overdose. The conference report also allows nurse practitioners and physician assistants to treat individuals with [[Page H4555]] opioid use disorders with buprenorphine. This final report also includes important and proven programs to address prevention, treatment, and recovery; but just changing policies alone won't be enough. This legislation takes only a small step at a time when the American people need us to run. Mr. Speaker, how can we truly help the American people without giving them the resources to fight this epidemic? We cannot wait while lives continue to be destroyed by opiate addiction and while treatment options remain out of reach. Congressional Democrats, Mr. Speaker, have long advocated for more funding in this package and have even proposed bipartisan policies to offset the cost, but Republicans have stubbornly refused to commit essential funding as part of this overall bill. Time and again they have rejected efforts to make a real difference by going beyond the important policy changes in this bill and actually supporting significant funding to properly take on this growing national epidemic today. Instead, Republicans have committed to increasing funding through the appropriations process, and we will certainly make sure that they live up to the repeated promises they have made in this regard. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this conference report to S. 524. This conference report is one of the proudest moments I have had as an elected Member of this body. I believe there are numerous challenges that our community healthcare providers face, and this bill helps them address those challenges. As a lifelong pharmacist, I believe the key first steps to address this opioid epidemic is education, improvement of treatment, and a reliance on State PDMP programs. This bill does all of that. Many of my colleagues have opposed this conference report and this bill because it does not authorize enough money or it doesn't provide every provision they want. There are things that I would have changed in this bill, but we have all had an opportunity to amend these provisions, and this has created a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation. Overall, this should not be the end of this conversation, but this bill is a good bill and addresses many of the problems Americans face with opioid addiction. I would like to commend leadership from both Chambers on this bill, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind). Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. There is no question that we have an opiate epidemic sweeping our communities throughout Wisconsin and the rest of the Nation. I spent the better part of the last year holding listening sessions back home in my congressional district in western and north central Wisconsin, getting feedback from law enforcement, healthcare providers, treatment centers, and families that have been impacted by drug addiction and the opioid addiction to ensure that this legislation that we have pending before us today doesn't get too far out ahead of what they actually need. There are a lot of good policy changes in this bill, but one thing that is lacking that the gentleman also pointed out is the resource aspect of this. They do need tools. They do need additional resources. I am hoping that later in the year, whether it is through a continuing resolution or the funding of these operations, that we can find in a bipartisan way the increase of necessary resources for folks back home so that they can get out ahead of this curve and do an adequate job of turning the trend line away. I am also supportive because the legislation before us contains the Jason Simcakoski PROMISE Act. Jason Simcakoski was a veteran who died at the Tomah VA Medical Center a couple of years ago due to an opioid drug overdose. We have, in this legislation, a continuation of reforms that are being implemented to ensure that all of our veterans, whether in Wisconsin or throughout the Nation, are getting the care and the treatment they need; that we continue down the road of revamping the pain management practices at places like Tomah. I am confident that with the provisions in here, if we do this the right way, that Tomah and the VA system could be a model of proper pain management practices not just within the VA system, but throughout the entire healthcare system. There is no question we haven't done a good job of managing pain as a nation. That is true of whether it is in the VA. It is true whether it is in the private health sector. This legislation before us today gives us an opportunity to continue down that road and do a much better job. The Jason Simcakoski Act, for instance, will call for clinical practice guidelines to be instituted throughout the entire VA system. It enhances pain management education and training for our healthcare providers. It improves realtime tracking and access to data on opioid usage. It also expands opiate safety initiatives throughout all the VA centers. It expands the patient advocacy program, which is particularly important because I think the families are the first line of defense when it comes to the care and treatment of all our veterans. They know what is working and what isn't. They need greater input and better lines of communication to help affect the course of treatment that is impacting the veterans in their life. It also calls on the VA to explore more complimentary and alternative forms of medicine to deal with pain management so we are not just loading our veterans up with a cocktail of prescription drugs, which oftentimes lead to addiction which can lead to meth and heroin usage. I also think that this legislation gives us an opportunity to establish that strong partnership that needs to exist at the Federal, State, and local level, including private entities, so we can do a better job on the opioid addiction problem throughout our Nation. This is an all-hands-on-deck moment. As a former special prosecutor who had to deal in the criminal system with a lot of it, our response cannot just be a criminal justice response. It has to be a public health response or we lose this battle going into it. I think this legislation does provide crucial tools to help us make that pivot, but we also need the crucial resources; and that is something that we are going to have to address as this year progresses. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. I appreciate the hard work that the committees and those involved have put into this legislation. But it will be a work in progress, and we have to continue to listen to the folks on the ground back home to ensure that they are getting the help and support that they need. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Chairman Upton's leadership and partnership throughout this important effort. Today is a proud day in our Nation's history. Today the House will complete its work on a comprehensive legislative package to combat the terrible epidemic of opioid abuse, which is ravaging our country. We have all heard the grim statistics. 129 people die every day from drug overdose. That is more than 47,000 a year. These people are our neighbors, friends, and loved ones. They come from all walks of life and all communities. They need our help. Today, the House is answering the call. The conference report we are considering today represents a truly comprehensive response to the opioid epidemic. It includes provisions from 18 bills passed by the House in May and addresses all facets of the epidemic. It permits the government to make grants for purposes of prevention, treatment and recovery, overdose reversal through the use of FDA-approved and appropriately labeled drugs and devices, and law enforcement and investigative purposes. Significantly, the conference report preserves the provisions of the Judiciary Committee's flagship bill, H.R. [[Page H4556]] 5046, which passed this House in May by an overwhelming 413-5 vote. This historic legislation, which was sponsored by Crime Subcommittee Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner, creates a comprehensive Justice Department grant program to help States fight opioid addiction. It authorizes $103 million annually over 5 years for the grant program. It directs precious taxpayer dollars responsibly by leveraging and streamlining existing programs, and it is fully offsetting the legislation in compliance with the House's CutGo proposal. The conference report authorizes this funding for a wide variety of anti-opioid activities, including drug courts which have proven to be highly successful and which I support. In fact, it is my expectation, Mr. Speaker, that drug courts will continue to receive funding levels in future years similar to current funding levels. In addition to H.R. 5046, this conference report contains provisions from three other Judiciary Committee bills, including H.R. 5052, the OPEN Act, which increases the transparency and accountability of the comprehensive opioid abuse grant program in H.R. 5046; H.R. 4985, the Kingpin Designation Improvement Act, which protects classified information from disclosure when a drug kingpin challenges his designation as such in a Federal court; and H.R. 5048, the Good Samaritan Assessment Act, which requires the GAO to study State and local Good Samaritan laws that protect caregivers, law enforcement personnel, and first responders who administer opioid overdose reversal drugs or devices from criminal or civil liability, as well as those who contact emergency service providers in response to an overdose. In addition, the Judiciary Committee moved as part of this package S. 32, the Transnational Drug Trafficking Act. That legislation, which has already been signed into law, improves law enforcement's ability to pursue international drug manufacturers, brokers, and distributors in source nations. Federal prosecutors can now use the important tools in that bill to pursue foreign drug traffickers who are poisoning American citizens. Along with the excellent legislation prepared by our sister committees, spearheaded by Chairmen Upton, Miller, and Kline, these bills make substantial policy changes within the Federal agencies responsible for fighting addiction. They take real steps to address the opioid epidemic and provide real relief for a real problem affecting real Americans. Members of this body should be proud of these accomplishments. {time} 1100 I would like to stress, Mr. Speaker, that opposition to this conference report on the basis of funding is wrong and misguided. As I stated, this legislation authorizes $103 million just for Justice Department programs. Under the leadership of Chairmen Rogers, Culberson, Cole, Crenshaw, and Dent, the House Committee on Appropriations has responded admirably to this epidemic by allocating hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for these programs. The CJS appropriations bill contains $103 million in funding for the DOJ program. The Labor/HHS bill, released Wednesday, contains $581 million to address opioid and heroin abuse, which is above even the President's budget request. The Financial Services and General Government bill has funded High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas and Drug-Free Communities Support Programs at record highs. Nobody can come to this floor and credibly claim that the House is not putting its money where its mouth is. I thank my colleagues for their support and hard work. Yesterday we received a letter signed by 233 addiction stakeholder groups, endorsing the conference report to S. 524. I urge everyone to support this conference report. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his excellent work in bringing this bipartisan legislation to the floor. With all due respect to Mr. Goodlatte, I credibly come to the floor to say that this bill does not provide the funding that we need to address the opioid crisis in our country. I thank Mr. Upton again. I know this is his last year as chairman of the committee. I thank him for his openness, his willingness to work in a bipartisan way, and I do think that this is a good piece of legislation. It is lacking one thing: the resources to get the job done. I also come to the floor as an appropriator, and to hear Mr. Goodlatte say what is coming out of here and coming out of there, in our subcommittee on Labor/HHS, we call it the lamb-eat-lamb committee because there was no good place to take money from. We had carefully and economically husbanded the resources in such a way, when we did budget agreements, to use the money very well for its purposes: the investments in education and health, et cetera. So when an emergency comes along like the opioid epidemic, like Zika, like Flint, these are emergencies, and by tradition, this House has always declared emergencies--whether a natural disaster or otherwise-- to say that funding would not be lamb-eat-lamb within the appropriations process and take funds from very needed initiatives that Congress had agreed to in our own authorizations otherwise. So it had been my intention for us to come to the floor to oppose this bill to be able to sustain a Presidential veto until there would be resources. But in the spirit of this day, we come to the floor instead to say let's move the process along, but let's also say that there are other issues, like opioids, and Zika, and Flint that we really have to address in the near term. The opioid epidemic, as it has been said by the distinguished chairman and ranking member and others, is such an important challenge to the well-being of our country. While you may say Flint is in Michigan and Zika is down south, the fact is they affect all of us. But opioids are right there in all of our communities, and all of the Members of Congress immediately see the need for the authorization but also for the funding. The opioid conference report includes many important authorizing provisions in a bipartisan way, but it does not include the new funds that are essential to saving lives from opioids. Around a dozen law enforcement people were at the White House yesterday talking about the opioid epidemic. Many people outside of the Congress support the principles in this bill. But do you know that some of those law enforcement officials are having separate fundraisers of their own in order to help people address their opioid challenge? We are just not living up to our responsibility in a timely fashion. Within the next week, hopefully, we will leave with some additional funding. The President has asked for $1.1 billion to address the problem. The distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary says that the appropriators are putting more than that in certain cases in opioids; but if they are taking it out of other priorities, other investments in the health and well-being and the security of the American people, we are doing this at the expense of other good investments. We will not stop fighting until America's families have the prevention, treatment, and recovery resources they need to overcome the opioid epidemic, and that is why for today, although the votes are there to sustain a Presidential veto, we don't encourage that. We encourage our cooperation today with the hope and the promise that Mr. Rogers, whom we all respect--I served with him on Appropriations-- and Mrs. Lowey can come to terms in a way that does not have the opioid epidemic funded at the expense of other investments important to the American people. It is a priority. It is an emergency. In other cases we have had emergency spending for just that. When we do budget agreements, as we did last year--very difficult staying under the caps and the rest--it was not with the idea that there would be a $1.1 billion need for opioids or $1.9 billion need for Zika funding or there wouldn't be hundreds of millions of dollars for Flint. These are extraordinary emergencies. They should be treated that way. Nonetheless, I congratulate Mr. Upton and Mr. Pallone and all who had a role in putting this legislation together. I hope that it is just a first [[Page H4557]] step that in the very, very near future we will have money to match the values that are contained in this legislation. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 21 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 22\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, a partner in this effort from day one. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I would briefly like to discuss with my friend and partner in this effort, the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, how the conference report encourages innovation by allowing alternative therapies to qualify for funding while also requiring evaluation and reporting on the effectiveness of all authorized programs. In my district, some nonprofit organizations are using animal- assisted psychotherapy to successfully address mental health and personal development needs, including for veterans, and animals have also helped prison inmates achieve life-changing developments. It is my understanding that these and other alternative therapies are eligible for funding under the grant programs contained in the conference report. And I would ask the gentleman from Michigan: Is that your understanding as well? Mr. UPTON. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. UPTON. Absolutely is the answer, yes. Section 601, the State demonstration grants for comprehensive opioid abuse response, is designed to allow States the flexibility to do what is right and aid in establishing a comprehensive response. Under this grant, we emphasize prevention and treatment, but those are not the only two ways to address the opioid epidemic. Recovery, like the good work that Chairman Goodlatte cited in his district, as it is in mine, is equally as important. We need a comprehensive response to the crisis that should leave no stone unturned in our quest for helping those in need. I want to thank the chairman for his help in that effort, and I absolutely agree with his reading of the bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues argue that we will pass this authorization bill today, and then sometime down the line we will provide funding through the regular appropriations process. But the problem is that that response does not match the urgency of the crisis. To understand why, let's just take a quick look at the 2016 appropriations process. While the fiscal year 2016 began on October 1, 2015, the omnibus fiscal year 2016 appropriations act did not become law until December 18, 2015. If, as expected, the fiscal year 2017 process is similar, it will be at least 6 months before we can provide funding through the fiscal year 2017 appropriations process; and that is 6 months in which more people will die from potentially preventable overdose deaths and more individuals and families in need of treatment options will be unable to access them. There is also no guarantee that additional funds will be made available through the appropriations process. The fiscal austerity policies of my Republican colleagues also make this option untenable. Due to the sequestration caps demanded by the Republicans, an increase in spending for one program can only occur with the cutting of funding for another program. While the Republicans will say they introduced a Labor/HHS bill with $500 million in funding for a comprehensive State grant program for substance abuse treatment, what they don't say is that to provide that funding, we will have to agree to cut funding for other critical programs. The Republican Labor/HHS appropriations bill proposes eliminating funding for ObamaCare, title X family planning services, education programs, and employment training and development programs. Not only are these cuts objectionable, we don't have to make such choices. We have bipartisan pay-fors available to offset the direct appropriations of funding now, and we cannot afford to wait. So this is truly an urgent crisis, and we should treat it as such by providing critical funding immediately. Failure to act will unacceptably lead to more deaths, and our communities cannot afford to wait any longer. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a fellow conferee and member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this conference report. It is a great step forward in the fight against the scourge of drug addiction. I was proud to serve on the conference committee that crafted this package, and I thank Chairman Upton and Chairman Grassley for their tremendous leadership on the issue. This measure includes language that I authored with my Democratic colleague, Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney of the Hudson Valley in New York State, that targets opioid addiction's strong ties to prescription drug abuse and the issue of overprescription. It is one part of a comprehensive plan that will make serious progress on this challenge that strains law enforcement and taxpayer resources and cuts too many lives tragically short. This package comes the same week we secured passage of a landmark overhaul of our Nation's mental health care system. These are major priorities of the American people, and this is how Congress should work, gaining ideas and insight from the constituencies across the Nation and working together in a bipartisan fashion to address the important issues confronting the United States. On this very sad day, given the horrific events in Dallas last night, we are reminded that a great many issues face our country. I hope the spirit of cooperation that secured this week's productivity will guide us on the other challenges we face as a nation. I want to work on what unites us in the United States and on the priorities of all Americans. This conference report is one of those priorities, and I urge a ``yes'' vote. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as I said before, this conference report does include important and proven programs to address prevention, treatment, and recovery with regard to opioid abuse, and I did want to mention a few. There is authorization to create a grant program for eligible entities to promote the prescribing of opioid reversal drugs, naloxone, in conjunction with opiates for patients at an elevated risk of overdose. There is a program to reauthorize SAMHSA grants for the funding of residential treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorders. There is a demonstration grant program to States to streamline State requirements and procedures in order to assist veterans who have completed military emergency medical technician training to meet requirements for becoming an emergency medical technician in the State. There is also a State grant program to increase the implementation of standing orders for opioid overdose reversal medication, again, naloxone. As I have said before, there are a number of very important programs here that authorize grants to States to deal with the prevention, treatment, and recovery from opioids. But, again, these programs will not be effective without some significant funding provided pursuant to those authorizations. So I want to stress, again, as Democrats, we support this bill because it does have authorization for many programs that will help with opioid addiction, but we need to hold the Republicans' feet to the fire to make sure that this funding is actually provided. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1115 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan), a fellow conferee and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. [[Page H4558]] Mr. MEEHAN. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this important bill. Mr. Speaker, the statistics are staggering. We are losing 120 a people a day to opioid abuse. Earlier this year, southeastern Pennsylvania lost an accomplished young man, John Decker, who succumbed to his battle with addiction. As a teenager, John injured his knee playing basketball. His physician prescribed opioids to manage the pain after surgery. John became addicted to the painkillers and moved on to using heroin. I introduced the John Thomas Decker Act with the goal of preventing injured youth and adolescent athletes from getting addicted to opioids and turning to heroin. But I use John's name because it is not about statistics; it is to demonstrate that we are talking about real people and struggling families here. The legislation, which is included in section 104 of the conference report, directs the United States Department of Health and Human Services to study what information and resources are available to youth athletes and their families regarding the dangers of opioid use and abuse, nonopioid treatment options, and how to seek addiction treatment. The Department must report its findings and work with stakeholders to disseminate resources to students, parents, and those involved in treating sports injuries, and that is how this can work together with things that are already happening in the community. I want to acknowledge what is going on in communities all across the country. Just last week, I visited Adapt Pharma, a constituent company, in Radnor, Pennsylvania. The company makes a Narcan nasal spray and is providing the antidote to high schools. Adapt Pharma and the National Association of School Nurses are working together to ensure that educational materials are available to students and their families about prescription drug abuse as well as treatment and recovery options that will work perfectly in tandem with this particular section. So, whether you are young athletes, pregnant mothers, struggling veterans, or suffering families, so many are going to be helped. I urge my colleagues to stand with the families who have suffered the effects of addiction and support the conference report. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the dean of the House and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, the crisis of opioid abuse and addiction clearly requires our immediate attention. I believe that that is now happening. I am grateful for the tireless work of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. I thank Chairman Goodlatte; Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee chairman, Jim Sensenbrenner; Crime Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee ranking member, Sheila Jackson Lee; and their staffs. And I also congratulate Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, who worked so hard to ensure this bill would find promising approaches to opioid abuse that were pioneered in her district. Finally, I wish to thank the ranking member, Frank Pallone of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and his staff for their assistance and coordination in this effort. Our work has focused on the need to address an urgent crisis. In my State of Michigan, there were 1,745 drug overdoses in the year 2014, and more than half of those overdose deaths were caused by opioids and heroin. Each day, 78 Americans die from an opioid overdose. Fortunately, we now have a better way of addressing issues of addiction, and we know that incarceration is not the answer. For instance, the Judiciary Committee's Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee held a hearing last year that examined, among other things, the promising use of the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion approach employed in cities such as Seattle, Washington, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. We know that there are effective ways to get addicts to treatment and to quickly provide them with needed services that address their addiction and prevent recidivism, and we know that evidence-based treatment and alternatives to incarceration work. Title II of this bill reflects much of this approach in the grant program, as reported by the Judiciary Committee and passed by the House in May of this year. While I have supported this effort, I have also supported alternative approaches that provide separate grant programs for many of these worthy purposes. Regardless of which approach we take, we must do more than simply authorize funding. We must provide real dollars that are urgently needed by those fighting this crisis, and I am disappointed that this bill does not do this. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great State of Michigan (Mr. Trott), a fellow conferee. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the conference report that we are considering today. And as my colleague, Mr. Conyers, just mentioned, 1,745 individuals died of a drug overdose in Michigan in 2014, and 449 of those individuals were in my home district in Oakland and Wayne Counties. So a disproportionate number of people were affected. As has been mentioned, this bill contains some good solutions toward fighting this epidemic: a comprehensive grant program, changes to existing law, and some new programs to help end the tragedies. Some have suggested, however, that our response is inadequate or too small of a step to fight this problem. I disagree. Let me say to those people who are listening, particularly those who have suffered from addiction or lost a loved one through the tragedy of an overdose, that Republicans and Democrats and the President recognize this epidemic. We are united in our commitment to defeat the abuse and tragedy. We in Congress will revisit our programs and solutions and the money we are spending to make sure that they are making a difference, and we will revisit the solutions and make sure that adequate resources are in place so we can end the terrible drug abuse and heroin overdoses that are affecting our communities. I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to serve on the conference committee. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to stress that President Obama recently announced additional actions to expand access to treatment, strengthen prescription drug monitoring, enable safe disposal of unneeded drugs, and accelerate research on pain and opioid misuse and overdose. The President, I think, has made it clear that addressing this epidemic is a priority for his administration. While Federal agencies have been using their authority to take every available action they can, Congress needs to provide additional funding to make lifesaving treatment available to everyone who needs it. The President has called for $1.1 billion in new funding to help Americans who want treatment wherever they live. Every day that passes without congressional action to provide these additional resources is a missed opportunity to get treatment to those who want it, help prevent overdoses, and support communities across the country impacted by this epidemic. Recovery from opioid and other substance use disorders is possible, and many Americans are able to recover because they get the treatment and care they need. But too many still are not able to get treatment. That is why the President has called on Congress to provide the resources needed to ensure that every American with an opioid use disorder who wants treatment can get it and start on the road to recovery. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), also a conferee and a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. We all have experienced the opioid epidemic in some way, whether it is through family, friends, or heartbreaking stories from constituents back home. [[Page H4559]] Opioid addiction is prevalent in our veteran community, and I am proud many of my provisions to help our heroes were included in this legislation. I want to thank the chairman for including those provisions in this particular conference report. My bills, the PROMISE Act and COVER Act, will update the clinical practice guidelines used to treat our servicemembers for pain management and provide a pathway forward to implement complementary and integrative health alternatives within the VA. With this bill, we can help our struggling heroes and others battling addiction across the Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on each side. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 14 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Michigan has 14\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), my partner in terms of a contiguous border and also a conferee. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This vital bill will help address the prescription drug epidemic we have seen plague our communities for so long. Dozens of Americans die each day from prescription drug overdoses. This has to stop. It is time for us to come together as a nation to tackle the issue that has infected every fabric of our society. I am very honored to have served on this conference committee for the bill, and I am thankful it is being considered today by the House. As a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have seen the opioid epidemic's effects on our Nation's veterans. Veterans are more vulnerable to chronic pain, more susceptible to addiction, but some VA facilities still overprescribe these powerful drugs. I have seen the problem firsthand with veterans coming into my office, often carrying a large box or bag of pills. In my home State of Indiana, the DEA raided the VA Medical Center in Marion after noticing the volume of narcotics and opioids purchased by the facility. For too long, the VA has relied too heavily on opioids to treat chronic pain. This bill addresses that by requiring the VA and the DOD to focus on improving their prescribing practices. It includes my piece of legislation requiring the VA to report to State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs, which are important and effective tools for stopping overprescription. It also allows the VA to consider nonopioid treatments for veterans with chronic pain. Mr. Speaker, there is a long battle ahead of us--we have got a long way to go, and a lot of damage has been done--but this bill represents an important step forward as we seek to stop overprescription and opioid addiction in our country. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters). Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, across the United States, we are faced with a substance abuse epidemic that results in overdose, addiction, and far too many deaths. From opioids to heroin, no community--not even Orange County, the place that I have called home for over 50 years--is immune. Last year, the number of deaths in Orange County caused by drug overdose rose to 400, the highest level in at least a decade. More than two-thirds of these untimely deaths involved opioids. Nationwide, nearly 130 people die every single day from drug abuse. Though this is a nationwide epidemic, there is not a one-size-fits- all cure to addiction. That is why this legislation is so important. I thank all of my colleagues who have worked so intently on these lifesaving policies. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure so that we can send it to the President's desk. As soon as this law is implemented, it will save lives and help Americans suffering from addiction reclaim their lives. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to again point out that the effort here is not only bipartisan, but we are also working with the administration to try to address this epidemic. And one of the things that we were trying to do with the legislation, but it became unnecessary because of the President's executive action, was with regard to bup. {time} 1130 This is a painkiller, if you will, that is used as an alternative to the addictive painkillers that cause the opiate problem. And until recently, under the law, a physician could only have up to 100 patients to whom he was administering bup, but now, in the last week or so, the President announced that that cap has been lifted to 275. Now, in the legislation, we do expand the types of providers who can treat opioid dependence using bup, but, at the same time, it was necessary, I believe, to raise that cap because there is a waiting list--a rather extensive waiting list--for people who would like to take advantage of bup. So I just wanted to say that that is one of the most important things that actually was done by the President. And it is very important for us to work together not only in terms of what we authorize, but also providing the funding for many of these programs, both what we are now authorizing pursuant to grants in this legislation, as well as what the administration is doing through agency action. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus). Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I commend the chairman, the ranking member, the conferees, on this work that they have accomplished. The opioid and heroin epidemic has hit western Pennsylvania hard. Nothing brings this crisis into sharper focus than when you are speaking with a parent who has lost a child, or a family member watching a loved one go through revolving doors of treatment and still be slipping away. This conference report has been a bipartisan, all-hands-on-deck effort reflective of the collaboration we see happening at the grassroots of our communities. I am pleased to see the conference report include the provision my colleague from across the aisle, Congressman Keating, and I championed in the House legislation to establish coprescribing guidelines for overdose antidotes such as naloxone. I am also pleased with how this legislation gives the proper focus to our veterans. This conference report is a necessary step in moving forward to address this crisis. Let us continue to work together to combat this deadly scourge. I urge its passage. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Again, Mr. Speaker, I will say that, after thoughtful consideration, I not only support the conference report, but I would urge my colleagues on the Democratic side to support the conference report. While I continue to believe that we cannot turn the tide on this epidemic without dedicated additional resources for States, the underlying policies included in this bill are important steps forward. As you know, Democratic conferees, along with the Democratic leadership, have worked tirelessly these past few weeks to try to include money for States to help treat our communities who are suffering. Republicans still, so far, refuse to commit the essential funding as part of this overall bill, but they have committed to increasing funding through the appropriations process, and I will continue to fight to ensure that they stand by that commitment. The American people are desperate for relief. We must answer their call and continue our efforts in Washington, and one way to do that, certainly, is to pass this conference report. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank my friend and partner, Mr. Pallone. We moved a majority of these bills [[Page H4560]] through the committee on a bipartisan basis. We had those votes here on the floor, a very strong vote as the process moved. Mr. Speaker, this bill is about treatment. It is about prevention. It is about recovery, helping law enforcement, particularly with our drug courts, and it adds new resources to help communities suffering from this terrible opioid epidemic. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act represents the most serious and comprehensive effort ever undertaken by this body to tackle the problem. CARA is a bipartisan blend of the best ideas from the House and the Senate. These bills passed with a combined 494 votes in the House and the Senate and, coupled with the great work led just this week by the House Appropriations Committee to add $581 million to help fund and prioritize these programs, it shows that we are tackling the problem head-on. Now, this is an authorization bill, not an appropriation bill. That is why, coupled with the appropriators, I think that we will get the job done. As I have said, at the end of the day, the money will be there. So those on the front lines fighting the opioid epidemic deserve a strong vote in the people's House. I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I just want to add my voice and thank Mr. Upton, as the chair of the conference, and Mr. Pallone, and all of the conferees, for what I thought was a significant historical moment. We have passed legislation, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, with no mandatory minimums. Our CARA bill speaks about grants, helping people overcome their addiction, but more importantly, helping communities. My community alone is suffering from something called Kush. That is not heroin, but all of these issues have to be confronted as a health epidemic. I thank the gentleman for accepting my amendment dealing with other drugs, about dealing with a public health epidemic, and I ask for support of the conference report. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the conference report for S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. The conference report is the product of a long process of consultation and hard work between Congress and experts and advocates representing a wide range of interests--including victims, addiction treatment specialists, and law enforcement. In many respects, this bill is a compromise--but it does reflect advances in our approach to substance addiction issues. As a Member of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic I have worked with my colleagues to come together with a comprehensive legislative package to address this national epidemic. I was an original cosponsor of the lead legislative measure and primary contribution of the House Judiciary Committee, H.R. 5046, the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, and I was a cosponsor of the predecessor bill, which is substantially similar to the Senate-passed version of S. 524. The text of H.R. 5046 is largely incorporated into the conference report, and would establish a grant program, to be administered by the Department of Justice, to assist states and local governments, particularly by helping criminal justice agencies to tackle the opioid problem from a variety of angles. It would encourage the development of alternatives to incarceration that provide treatment as a solution to the underlying motivation for criminal behavior or conduct associated with mental disorders. Combined with other treatment programs under the jurisdiction of other Committees, the approach Congress is taking with the crisis of heroin and other opioids is thoughtful and comprehensive. I hope it signals a departure from some of the failed approaches concerning other drug crises in the past. For instance, our response to the surge in crack cocaine in the 1980s was to enact draconian mandatory minimum penalties with vastly disparate treatment for crack and powder cocaine. At that time, Congress took action that we are still trying to rectify. At one point, more than 80 percent of the defendants sentenced for crack offenses were African American, despite the fact that more than 66 percent of crack users are white or Hispanic. As we work on other legislation to address the enforcement and sentencing disparities related to the crack issue, we must re-examine our approach to that and other drug issues. I am grateful for the assistance of my colleague, Bob Goodlatte, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for working with me to include in this bill my amendment to express the sense of the Congress that an effective and fiscally responsible approach to addressing substance abuse epidemics--no matter which drug is involved--requires treating such epidemics as a public health emergencies emphasizing prevention, treatment, and recovery. Provided in Section 708 of the Report, the Sense of Congress Regarding Treatment of Substance Abuse Epidemics expresses that decades of experience and research have demonstrated that a fiscally responsible approach to addressing the opioid abuse epidemic and other substance abuse epidemics requires treating such epidemics as a public health emergency emphasizing prevention, treatment and recovery. Indeed, we must adopt a public health approach with regard to substance abuse issues going forward. And I am heartened that, in this bill, we are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory minimums that add to mass incarceration, but we are supporting proven anti-addiction mechanisms. However, the conference committee had the opportunity to do even more--as is necessary given the urgency of the current crisis--and provide real money, right now, to implement the programs the bill authorizes. Unfortunately, this bill does not do that and our communities remain in dire need of resources to save lives that are in immediate jeopardy. That is the unfinished business of this effort and we must not rest until we have done all that we can in Congress to help protect our communities from opioid abuse. In contrast to the way we are dealing with the opioid crisis is the ill-advised strict ``law-enforcement'' centered approach Congress took in addressing crack cocaine crisis in the 1980s that that we are still trying to rectify. At one point, more than 80 percent of the defendants sentenced for crack offenses were African American, despite the fact that more than 66 percent of crack users are white or Hispanic. While we are now engaged in a comprehensive ``public health'' approach centered on public health in addressing the crisis involving heroin and other opioids, we must not forget that there is unfinished work to be done to address the enforcement and sentencing disparities related to the crack cocaine. We are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory minimums but we are funding anti-addiction mechanisms such as treatment alternatives to incarceration. We are not adding to mass incarceration--with all of the related and devastating collateral consequences--but instead we are incentivizing state and local governments to prevent, treat, and heal. That is what we should be doing, and that is what we should have done for crack and cocaine addicts. But it is not too late--we should find a way, before this Congress adjourns sine die to apply this more comprehensive approach, including treatment alternatives, to those suffering from crack and cocaine addiction. legislation supported by jackson lee 1.

I was very pleased to work with her on the successful amendment that we added in the conference as part of this agreement, and I look for its swift passage today. [[Page H4561]] I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report of S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA). Families devastated by opioid addiction deserve action, and this legislation will take some important steps to reduce the toll on our communities. None of our districts is immune to this epidemic that is causing so much death and heartache. The conference report includes elements from both the bipartisan House and Senate versions of their respective opioid measures recently approved almost unanimously. It includes provisions that incorporate prevention tactics and expanded access to treatment, recovery support services, and overdose reversals. Additionally, the report encourages criminal justice agencies to integrate and sustain Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) programs. Although this report includes vital and much needed measures, we cannot pretend that it will solve the problem. I am disappointed that this legislation does not include adequate funding to fully help us get ahead of this crisis. During conference, my Democratic colleagues from both chambers offered amendments that would provide funding for the authorizations within the package. Unfortunately, they were turned down, so we must continue to fight for the resources necessary to meaningfully implement this package. I request my colleagues to support this report and to continue to work on a bipartisan basis to provide the resources needed to save lives. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 809, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the conference report.

(for conference report and statement, see proceedings of the house of july 6, 2016, at page h4392.) the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from michigan (mr. upton) and the gentleman from new jersey (mr. pallone) each will control 30 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from michigan. general leave mr. upton. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the conference report to accompany s. 524. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from michigan? there was no objection. mr. upton. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. the simple truth is that we are in the midst of a real epidemic. nearly every 12 minutes, someone in america dies of a drug overdose. the cdc reports over a quarter billion opioid prescriptions were written in the year 2012. the abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin has impacted, virtually, every single community. it is an epidemic that has no boundaries and does not discriminate. in my state of michigan, we are seeing 10 times as many deaths today as there were 15 years ago. sadly, the number continues to surge; but behind every statistic is a person who was loved, part of a family and community, and, yes, who was lost too soon. {time} 1045 it is a frightening reality, but we have to face this epidemic head on, and today's vote is an important step forward. since the beginning of this process, our focus has been, and continues to be, on attacking this public health crisis from every side, from zeroing in on treatment for addiction and overdoses to reforming prescription practices in the delivery of medicines and working with law enforcement of the department of veterans affairs. specifically, this conference report addresses prevention care by requiring hhs to create an interagency task force to address chronic and pain management care and by reauthorizing nasper, a piece of legislation the house has passed with very large bipartisan support. the conference report addresses treatment by ensuring opioid reversal medication is accessible to patients, their family members and, yes, first responders as well. these medications are key to stopping the overdose epidemic and getting these patients into proper treatment to become productive members of our society. the conference report also ensures proper oversight and accountability by including the majority leader's open act. the conference report, as a whole, touches on the spectrum of issues driving the opioid crisis. while there is no one solution, we are making progress in addressing a problem that has rapidly grown. so i want to thank all my colleagues--certainly on the energy and commerce committee that i chair and those off--for working to advance these important bipartisan bills that will make a real difference in our communities. i am also proud that our final package has achieved the support of over 200 of the nation's leading advocacy groups, groups from across the country that are focused on recovery. these advocates are on the front lines in this epidemic and truly appreciate the positive impact that our solutions will have in every community. there is an urgency to our work as drug overdose deaths surge in michigan and beyond. we owe this effort to the past, present, and, sadly, future victims of the opioid epidemic; our neighbors, friends, family across every part of the family in every demographic group. so let's come together and get the job done. what we are doing will save lives. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. after much thought, i have decided to support the conference report on s. 524. it is not perfect and does not nearly do enough from a funding perspective, but it makes some important steps that would allow us to begin to address the opioid addiction crisis that is impacting our nation. the american people are desperate for relief from the opioid epidemic currently devastating our country, and they are depending on this congress to act. by now, we have all heard the stories: young people taken from their families in their prime; babies born suffering from the cruel effects of opioid withdrawal; and parents who have lost the ability to care for their families as they battle their addiction. to treat this epidemic as anything less than a national crisis would be a terrible mistake. and even though we have already lost far too many lives to overdoses, we still have an opportunity to save many more. this conference report includes many important policies that have bipartisan agreement. for example, we will now allow patients and doctors to choose to partially fill their opioids so that excess medicines are not dispensed unnecessarily. this will reduce the number of unused pills in circulation, which will reduce the risk of misuse, diversion, and overdose. the conference report also allows nurse practitioners and physician assistants to treat individuals with [[page h4555]] opioid use disorders with buprenorphine. this final report also includes important and proven programs to address prevention, treatment, and recovery; but just changing policies alone won't be enough. this legislation takes only a small step at a time when the american people need us to run. mr. speaker, how can we truly help the american people without giving them the resources to fight this epidemic? we cannot wait while lives continue to be destroyed by opiate addiction and while treatment options remain out of reach. congressional democrats, mr. speaker, have long advocated for more funding in this package and have even proposed bipartisan policies to offset the cost, but republicans have stubbornly refused to commit essential funding as part of this overall bill. time and again they have rejected efforts to make a real difference by going beyond the important policy changes in this bill and actually supporting significant funding to properly take on this growing national epidemic today. instead, republicans have committed to increasing funding through the appropriations process, and we will certainly make sure that they live up to the repeated promises they have made in this regard. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. upton. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia (mr. carter). mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of this conference report to s. 524. this conference report is one of the proudest moments i have had as an elected member of this body. i believe there are numerous challenges that our community healthcare providers face, and this bill helps them address those challenges. as a lifelong pharmacist, i believe the key first steps to address this opioid epidemic is education, improvement of treatment, and a reliance on state pdmp programs. this bill does all of that. many of my colleagues have opposed this conference report and this bill because it does not authorize enough money or it doesn't provide every provision they want. there are things that i would have changed in this bill, but we have all had an opportunity to amend these provisions, and this has created a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation. overall, this should not be the end of this conversation, but this bill is a good bill and addresses many of the problems americans face with opioid addiction. i would like to commend leadership from both chambers on this bill, and i encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. kind). mr. kind. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the comprehensive addiction and recovery act. there is no question that we have an opiate epidemic sweeping our communities throughout wisconsin and the rest of the nation. i spent the better part of the last year holding listening sessions back home in my congressional district in western and north central wisconsin, getting feedback from law enforcement, healthcare providers, treatment centers, and families that have been impacted by drug addiction and the opioid addiction to ensure that this legislation that we have pending before us today doesn't get too far out ahead of what they actually need. there are a lot of good policy changes in this bill, but one thing that is lacking that the gentleman also pointed out is the resource aspect of this. they do need tools. they do need additional resources. i am hoping that later in the year, whether it is through a continuing resolution or the funding of these operations, that we can find in a bipartisan way the increase of necessary resources for folks back home so that they can get out ahead of this curve and do an adequate job of turning the trend line away. i am also supportive because the legislation before us contains the jason simcakoski promise act. jason simcakoski was a veteran who died at the tomah va medical center a couple of years ago due to an opioid drug overdose. we have, in this legislation, a continuation of reforms that are being implemented to ensure that all of our veterans, whether in wisconsin or throughout the nation, are getting the care and the treatment they need; that we continue down the road of revamping the pain management practices at places like tomah. i am confident that with the provisions in here, if we do this the right way, that tomah and the va system could be a model of proper pain management practices not just within the va system, but throughout the entire healthcare system. there is no question we haven't done a good job of managing pain as a nation. that is true of whether it is in the va. it is true whether it is in the private health sector. this legislation before us today gives us an opportunity to continue down that road and do a much better job. the jason simcakoski act, for instance, will call for clinical practice guidelines to be instituted throughout the entire va system. it enhances pain management education and training for our healthcare providers. it improves realtime tracking and access to data on opioid usage. it also expands opiate safety initiatives throughout all the va centers. it expands the patient advocacy program, which is particularly important because i think the families are the first line of defense when it comes to the care and treatment of all our veterans. they know what is working and what isn't. they need greater input and better lines of communication to help affect the course of treatment that is impacting the veterans in their life. it also calls on the va to explore more complimentary and alternative forms of medicine to deal with pain management so we are not just loading our veterans up with a cocktail of prescription drugs, which oftentimes lead to addiction which can lead to meth and heroin usage. i also think that this legislation gives us an opportunity to establish that strong partnership that needs to exist at the federal, state, and local level, including private entities, so we can do a better job on the opioid addiction problem throughout our nation. this is an all-hands-on-deck moment. as a former special prosecutor who had to deal in the criminal system with a lot of it, our response cannot just be a criminal justice response. it has to be a public health response or we lose this battle going into it. i think this legislation does provide crucial tools to help us make that pivot, but we also need the crucial resources; and that is something that we are going to have to address as this year progresses. i encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. i appreciate the hard work that the committees and those involved have put into this legislation. but it will be a work in progress, and we have to continue to listen to the folks on the ground back home to ensure that they are getting the help and support that they need. mr. upton. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from virginia (mr. goodlatte), chairman of the house judiciary committee. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, i appreciate chairman upton's leadership and partnership throughout this important effort. today is a proud day in our nation's history. today the house will complete its work on a comprehensive legislative package to combat the terrible epidemic of opioid abuse, which is ravaging our country. we have all heard the grim statistics. 129 people die every day from drug overdose. that is more than 47,000 a year. these people are our neighbors, friends, and loved ones. they come from all walks of life and all communities. they need our help. today, the house is answering the call. the conference report we are considering today represents a truly comprehensive response to the opioid epidemic. it includes provisions from 18 bills passed by the house in may and addresses all facets of the epidemic. it permits the government to make grants for purposes of prevention, treatment and recovery, overdose reversal through the use of fda-approved and appropriately labeled drugs and devices, and law enforcement and investigative purposes. significantly, the conference report preserves the provisions of the judiciary committee's flagship bill, h.r. [[page h4556]] 5046, which passed this house in may by an overwhelming 413-5 vote. this historic legislation, which was sponsored by crime subcommittee chairman jim sensenbrenner, creates a comprehensive justice department grant program to help states fight opioid addiction. it authorizes $103 million annually over 5 years for the grant program. it directs precious taxpayer dollars responsibly by leveraging and streamlining existing programs, and it is fully offsetting the legislation in compliance with the house's cutgo proposal. the conference report authorizes this funding for a wide variety of anti-opioid activities, including drug courts which have proven to be highly successful and which i support. in fact, it is my expectation, mr. speaker, that drug courts will continue to receive funding levels in future years similar to current funding levels. in addition to h.r. 5046, this conference report contains provisions from three other judiciary committee bills, including h.r. 5052, the open act, which increases the transparency and accountability of the comprehensive opioid abuse grant program in h.r. 5046; h.r. 4985, the kingpin designation improvement act, which protects classified information from disclosure when a drug kingpin challenges his designation as such in a federal court; and h.r. 5048, the good samaritan assessment act, which requires the gao to study state and local good samaritan laws that protect caregivers, law enforcement personnel, and first responders who administer opioid overdose reversal drugs or devices from criminal or civil liability, as well as those who contact emergency service providers in response to an overdose. in addition, the judiciary committee moved as part of this package s. 32, the transnational drug trafficking act. that legislation, which has already been signed into law, improves law enforcement's ability to pursue international drug manufacturers, brokers, and distributors in source nations. federal prosecutors can now use the important tools in that bill to pursue foreign drug traffickers who are poisoning american citizens. along with the excellent legislation prepared by our sister committees, spearheaded by chairmen upton, miller, and kline, these bills make substantial policy changes within the federal agencies responsible for fighting addiction. they take real steps to address the opioid epidemic and provide real relief for a real problem affecting real americans. members of this body should be proud of these accomplishments. {time} 1100 i would like to stress, mr. speaker, that opposition to this conference report on the basis of funding is wrong and misguided. as i stated, this legislation authorizes $103 million just for justice department programs. under the leadership of chairmen rogers, culberson, cole, crenshaw, and dent, the house committee on appropriations has responded admirably to this epidemic by allocating hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for these programs. the cjs appropriations bill contains $103 million in funding for the doj program. the labor/hhs bill, released wednesday, contains $581 million to address opioid and heroin abuse, which is above even the president's budget request. the financial services and general government bill has funded high intensity drug trafficking areas and drug-free communities support programs at record highs. nobody can come to this floor and credibly claim that the house is not putting its money where its mouth is. i thank my colleagues for their support and hard work. yesterday we received a letter signed by 233 addiction stakeholder groups, endorsing the conference report to s. 524. i urge everyone to support this conference report. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california (ms. pelosi), our democratic leader. ms. pelosi. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. i thank him for his excellent work in bringing this bipartisan legislation to the floor. with all due respect to mr. goodlatte, i credibly come to the floor to say that this bill does not provide the funding that we need to address the opioid crisis in our country. i thank mr. upton again. i know this is his last year as chairman of the committee. i thank him for his openness, his willingness to work in a bipartisan way, and i do think that this is a good piece of legislation. it is lacking one thing: the resources to get the job done. i also come to the floor as an appropriator, and to hear mr. goodlatte say what is coming out of here and coming out of there, in our subcommittee on labor/hhs, we call it the lamb-eat-lamb committee because there was no good place to take money from. we had carefully and economically husbanded the resources in such a way, when we did budget agreements, to use the money very well for its purposes: the investments in education and health, et cetera. so when an emergency comes along like the opioid epidemic, like zika, like flint, these are emergencies, and by tradition, this house has always declared emergencies--whether a natural disaster or otherwise-- to say that funding would not be lamb-eat-lamb within the appropriations process and take funds from very needed initiatives that congress had agreed to in our own authorizations otherwise. so it had been my intention for us to come to the floor to oppose this bill to be able to sustain a presidential veto until there would be resources. but in the spirit of this day, we come to the floor instead to say let's move the process along, but let's also say that there are other issues, like opioids, and zika, and flint that we really have to address in the near term. the opioid epidemic, as it has been said by the distinguished chairman and ranking member and others, is such an important challenge to the well-being of our country. while you may say flint is in michigan and zika is down south, the fact is they affect all of us. but opioids are right there in all of our communities, and all of the members of congress immediately see the need for the authorization but also for the funding. the opioid conference report includes many important authorizing provisions in a bipartisan way, but it does not include the new funds that are essential to saving lives from opioids. around a dozen law enforcement people were at the white house yesterday talking about the opioid epidemic. many people outside of the congress support the principles in this bill. but do you know that some of those law enforcement officials are having separate fundraisers of their own in order to help people address their opioid challenge? we are just not living up to our responsibility in a timely fashion. within the next week, hopefully, we will leave with some additional funding. the president has asked for $1.1 billion to address the problem. the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary says that the appropriators are putting more than that in certain cases in opioids; but if they are taking it out of other priorities, other investments in the health and well-being and the security of the american people, we are doing this at the expense of other good investments. we will not stop fighting until america's families have the prevention, treatment, and recovery resources they need to overcome the opioid epidemic, and that is why for today, although the votes are there to sustain a presidential veto, we don't encourage that. we encourage our cooperation today with the hope and the promise that mr. rogers, whom we all respect--i served with him on appropriations-- and mrs. lowey can come to terms in a way that does not have the opioid epidemic funded at the expense of other investments important to the american people. it is a priority. it is an emergency. in other cases we have had emergency spending for just that. when we do budget agreements, as we did last year--very difficult staying under the caps and the rest--it was not with the idea that there would be a $1.1 billion need for opioids or $1.9 billion need for zika funding or there wouldn't be hundreds of millions of dollars for flint. these are extraordinary emergencies. they should be treated that way. nonetheless, i congratulate mr. upton and mr. pallone and all who had a role in putting this legislation together. i hope that it is just a first [[page h4557]] step that in the very, very near future we will have money to match the values that are contained in this legislation. mr. upton. mr. speaker, may i inquire as to how much time is remaining on both sides? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from michigan has 21 minutes remaining. the gentleman from new jersey has 22\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. upton. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from virginia (mr. goodlatte) the chairman of the committee on the judiciary, a partner in this effort from day one. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, i would briefly like to discuss with my friend and partner in this effort, the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce, how the conference report encourages innovation by allowing alternative therapies to qualify for funding while also requiring evaluation and reporting on the effectiveness of all authorized programs. in my district, some nonprofit organizations are using animal- assisted psychotherapy to successfully address mental health and personal development needs, including for veterans, and animals have also helped prison inmates achieve life-changing developments. it is my understanding that these and other alternative therapies are eligible for funding under the grant programs contained in the conference report. and i would ask the gentleman from michigan: is that your understanding as well? mr. upton. will the gentleman yield? mr. goodlatte. i yield to the gentleman from michigan. mr. upton. absolutely is the answer, yes. section 601, the state demonstration grants for comprehensive opioid abuse response, is designed to allow states the flexibility to do what is right and aid in establishing a comprehensive response. under this grant, we emphasize prevention and treatment, but those are not the only two ways to address the opioid epidemic. recovery, like the good work that chairman goodlatte cited in his district, as it is in mine, is equally as important. we need a comprehensive response to the crisis that should leave no stone unturned in our quest for helping those in need. i want to thank the chairman for his help in that effort, and i absolutely agree with his reading of the bill. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, my republican colleagues argue that we will pass this authorization bill today, and then sometime down the line we will provide funding through the regular appropriations process. but the problem is that that response does not match the urgency of the crisis. to understand why, let's just take a quick look at the 2016 appropriations process. while the fiscal year 2016 began on october 1, 2015, the omnibus fiscal year 2016 appropriations act did not become law until december 18, 2015. if, as expected, the fiscal year 2017 process is similar, it will be at least 6 months before we can provide funding through the fiscal year 2017 appropriations process; and that is 6 months in which more people will die from potentially preventable overdose deaths and more individuals and families in need of treatment options will be unable to access them. there is also no guarantee that additional funds will be made available through the appropriations process. the fiscal austerity policies of my republican colleagues also make this option untenable. due to the sequestration caps demanded by the republicans, an increase in spending for one program can only occur with the cutting of funding for another program. while the republicans will say they introduced a labor/hhs bill with $500 million in funding for a comprehensive state grant program for substance abuse treatment, what they don't say is that to provide that funding, we will have to agree to cut funding for other critical programs. the republican labor/hhs appropriations bill proposes eliminating funding for obamacare, title x family planning services, education programs, and employment training and development programs. not only are these cuts objectionable, we don't have to make such choices. we have bipartisan pay-fors available to offset the direct appropriations of funding now, and we cannot afford to wait. so this is truly an urgent crisis, and we should treat it as such by providing critical funding immediately. failure to act will unacceptably lead to more deaths, and our communities cannot afford to wait any longer. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. upton. mr. speaker, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. lance), a fellow conferee and member of the committee on energy and commerce. mr. lance. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of this conference report. it is a great step forward in the fight against the scourge of drug addiction. i was proud to serve on the conference committee that crafted this package, and i thank chairman upton and chairman grassley for their tremendous leadership on the issue. this measure includes language that i authored with my democratic colleague, congressman sean patrick maloney of the hudson valley in new york state, that targets opioid addiction's strong ties to prescription drug abuse and the issue of overprescription. it is one part of a comprehensive plan that will make serious progress on this challenge that strains law enforcement and taxpayer resources and cuts too many lives tragically short. this package comes the same week we secured passage of a landmark overhaul of our nation's mental health care system. these are major priorities of the american people, and this is how congress should work, gaining ideas and insight from the constituencies across the nation and working together in a bipartisan fashion to address the important issues confronting the united states. on this very sad day, given the horrific events in dallas last night, we are reminded that a great many issues face our country. i hope the spirit of cooperation that secured this week's productivity will guide us on the other challenges we face as a nation. i want to work on what unites us in the united states and on the priorities of all americans. this conference report is one of those priorities, and i urge a ``yes'' vote. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, as i said before, this conference report does include important and proven programs to address prevention, treatment, and recovery with regard to opioid abuse, and i did want to mention a few. there is authorization to create a grant program for eligible entities to promote the prescribing of opioid reversal drugs, naloxone, in conjunction with opiates for patients at an elevated risk of overdose. there is a program to reauthorize samhsa grants for the funding of residential treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorders. there is a demonstration grant program to states to streamline state requirements and procedures in order to assist veterans who have completed military emergency medical technician training to meet requirements for becoming an emergency medical technician in the state. there is also a state grant program to increase the implementation of standing orders for opioid overdose reversal medication, again, naloxone. as i have said before, there are a number of very important programs here that authorize grants to states to deal with the prevention, treatment, and recovery from opioids. but, again, these programs will not be effective without some significant funding provided pursuant to those authorizations. so i want to stress, again, as democrats, we support this bill because it does have authorization for many programs that will help with opioid addiction, but we need to hold the republicans' feet to the fire to make sure that this funding is actually provided. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1115 mr. upton. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. meehan), a fellow conferee and a member of the ways and means committee. [[page h4558]] mr. meehan. i thank the chairman for his leadership on this important bill. mr. speaker, the statistics are staggering. we are losing 120 a people a day to opioid abuse. earlier this year, southeastern pennsylvania lost an accomplished young man, john decker, who succumbed to his battle with addiction. as a teenager, john injured his knee playing basketball. his physician prescribed opioids to manage the pain after surgery. john became addicted to the painkillers and moved on to using heroin. i introduced the john thomas decker act with the goal of preventing injured youth and adolescent athletes from getting addicted to opioids and turning to heroin. but i use john's name because it is not about statistics; it is to demonstrate that we are talking about real people and struggling families here. the legislation, which is included in section 104 of the conference report, directs the united states department of health and human services to study what information and resources are available to youth athletes and their families regarding the dangers of opioid use and abuse, nonopioid treatment options, and how to seek addiction treatment. the department must report its findings and work with stakeholders to disseminate resources to students, parents, and those involved in treating sports injuries, and that is how this can work together with things that are already happening in the community. i want to acknowledge what is going on in communities all across the country. just last week, i visited adapt pharma, a constituent company, in radnor, pennsylvania. the company makes a narcan nasal spray and is providing the antidote to high schools. adapt pharma and the national association of school nurses are working together to ensure that educational materials are available to students and their families about prescription drug abuse as well as treatment and recovery options that will work perfectly in tandem with this particular section. so, whether you are young athletes, pregnant mothers, struggling veterans, or suffering families, so many are going to be helped. i urge my colleagues to stand with the families who have suffered the effects of addiction and support the conference report. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. conyers), the dean of the house and the ranking member of the judiciary committee. mr. conyers. mr. speaker, the crisis of opioid abuse and addiction clearly requires our immediate attention. i believe that that is now happening. i am grateful for the tireless work of my colleagues on the judiciary committee. i thank chairman goodlatte; crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations subcommittee chairman, jim sensenbrenner; crime terrorism, homeland security, and investigations subcommittee ranking member, sheila jackson lee; and their staffs. and i also congratulate congresswoman suzan delbene, who worked so hard to ensure this bill would find promising approaches to opioid abuse that were pioneered in her district. finally, i wish to thank the ranking member, frank pallone of the energy and commerce committee, and his staff for their assistance and coordination in this effort. our work has focused on the need to address an urgent crisis. in my state of michigan, there were 1,745 drug overdoses in the year 2014, and more than half of those overdose deaths were caused by opioids and heroin. each day, 78 americans die from an opioid overdose. fortunately, we now have a better way of addressing issues of addiction, and we know that incarceration is not the answer. for instance, the judiciary committee's crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations subcommittee held a hearing last year that examined, among other things, the promising use of the law enforcement assisted diversion approach employed in cities such as seattle, washington, and santa fe, new mexico. we know that there are effective ways to get addicts to treatment and to quickly provide them with needed services that address their addiction and prevent recidivism, and we know that evidence-based treatment and alternatives to incarceration work. title ii of this bill reflects much of this approach in the grant program, as reported by the judiciary committee and passed by the house in may of this year. while i have supported this effort, i have also supported alternative approaches that provide separate grant programs for many of these worthy purposes. regardless of which approach we take, we must do more than simply authorize funding. we must provide real dollars that are urgently needed by those fighting this crisis, and i am disappointed that this bill does not do this. mr. upton. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great state of michigan (mr. trott), a fellow conferee. mr. trott. mr. speaker, i am proud to support the conference report that we are considering today. and as my colleague, mr. conyers, just mentioned, 1,745 individuals died of a drug overdose in michigan in 2014, and 449 of those individuals were in my home district in oakland and wayne counties. so a disproportionate number of people were affected. as has been mentioned, this bill contains some good solutions toward fighting this epidemic: a comprehensive grant program, changes to existing law, and some new programs to help end the tragedies. some have suggested, however, that our response is inadequate or too small of a step to fight this problem. i disagree. let me say to those people who are listening, particularly those who have suffered from addiction or lost a loved one through the tragedy of an overdose, that republicans and democrats and the president recognize this epidemic. we are united in our commitment to defeat the abuse and tragedy. we in congress will revisit our programs and solutions and the money we are spending to make sure that they are making a difference, and we will revisit the solutions and make sure that adequate resources are in place so we can end the terrible drug abuse and heroin overdoses that are affecting our communities. i thank the gentleman for the opportunity to serve on the conference committee. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i want to stress that president obama recently announced additional actions to expand access to treatment, strengthen prescription drug monitoring, enable safe disposal of unneeded drugs, and accelerate research on pain and opioid misuse and overdose. the president, i think, has made it clear that addressing this epidemic is a priority for his administration. while federal agencies have been using their authority to take every available action they can, congress needs to provide additional funding to make lifesaving treatment available to everyone who needs it. the president has called for $1.1 billion in new funding to help americans who want treatment wherever they live. every day that passes without congressional action to provide these additional resources is a missed opportunity to get treatment to those who want it, help prevent overdoses, and support communities across the country impacted by this epidemic. recovery from opioid and other substance use disorders is possible, and many americans are able to recover because they get the treatment and care they need. but too many still are not able to get treatment. that is why the president has called on congress to provide the resources needed to ensure that every american with an opioid use disorder who wants treatment can get it and start on the road to recovery. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. upton. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from florida (mr. bilirakis), also a conferee and a member of the energy and commerce committee. mr. bilirakis. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of the comprehensive addiction and recovery act. we all have experienced the opioid epidemic in some way, whether it is through family, friends, or heartbreaking stories from constituents back home. [[page h4559]] opioid addiction is prevalent in our veteran community, and i am proud many of my provisions to help our heroes were included in this legislation. i want to thank the chairman for including those provisions in this particular conference report. my bills, the promise act and cover act, will update the clinical practice guidelines used to treat our servicemembers for pain management and provide a pathway forward to implement complementary and integrative health alternatives within the va. with this bill, we can help our struggling heroes and others battling addiction across the nation. i urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, may i inquire as to the time remaining on each side. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from new jersey has 14 minutes remaining. the gentleman from michigan has 14\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. upton. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from indiana (mrs. walorski), my partner in terms of a contiguous border and also a conferee. mrs. walorski. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of s. 524, the comprehensive addiction and recovery act. this vital bill will help address the prescription drug epidemic we have seen plague our communities for so long. dozens of americans die each day from prescription drug overdoses. this has to stop. it is time for us to come together as a nation to tackle the issue that has infected every fabric of our society. i am very honored to have served on this conference committee for the bill, and i am thankful it is being considered today by the house. as a member of the house veterans' affairs committee, i have seen the opioid epidemic's effects on our nation's veterans. veterans are more vulnerable to chronic pain, more susceptible to addiction, but some va facilities still overprescribe these powerful drugs. i have seen the problem firsthand with veterans coming into my office, often carrying a large box or bag of pills. in my home state of indiana, the dea raided the va medical center in marion after noticing the volume of narcotics and opioids purchased by the facility. for too long, the va has relied too heavily on opioids to treat chronic pain. this bill addresses that by requiring the va and the dod to focus on improving their prescribing practices. it includes my piece of legislation requiring the va to report to state prescription drug monitoring programs, which are important and effective tools for stopping overprescription. it also allows the va to consider nonopioid treatments for veterans with chronic pain. mr. speaker, there is a long battle ahead of us--we have got a long way to go, and a lot of damage has been done--but this bill represents an important step forward as we seek to stop overprescription and opioid addiction in our country. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. mr. upton. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california (mrs. mimi walters). mrs. mimi walters of california. mr. speaker, across the united states, we are faced with a substance abuse epidemic that results in overdose, addiction, and far too many deaths. from opioids to heroin, no community--not even orange county, the place that i have called home for over 50 years--is immune. last year, the number of deaths in orange county caused by drug overdose rose to 400, the highest level in at least a decade. more than two-thirds of these untimely deaths involved opioids. nationwide, nearly 130 people die every single day from drug abuse. though this is a nationwide epidemic, there is not a one-size-fits- all cure to addiction. that is why this legislation is so important. i thank all of my colleagues who have worked so intently on these lifesaving policies. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure so that we can send it to the president's desk. as soon as this law is implemented, it will save lives and help americans suffering from addiction reclaim their lives. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i just want to again point out that the effort here is not only bipartisan, but we are also working with the administration to try to address this epidemic. and one of the things that we were trying to do with the legislation, but it became unnecessary because of the president's executive action, was with regard to bup. {time} 1130 this is a painkiller, if you will, that is used as an alternative to the addictive painkillers that cause the opiate problem. and until recently, under the law, a physician could only have up to 100 patients to whom he was administering bup, but now, in the last week or so, the president announced that that cap has been lifted to 275. now, in the legislation, we do expand the types of providers who can treat opioid dependence using bup, but, at the same time, it was necessary, i believe, to raise that cap because there is a waiting list--a rather extensive waiting list--for people who would like to take advantage of bup. so i just wanted to say that that is one of the most important things that actually was done by the president. and it is very important for us to work together not only in terms of what we authorize, but also providing the funding for many of these programs, both what we are now authorizing pursuant to grants in this legislation, as well as what the administration is doing through agency action. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. upton. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. rothfus). mr. rothfus. mr. speaker, i commend the chairman, the ranking member, the conferees, on this work that they have accomplished. the opioid and heroin epidemic has hit western pennsylvania hard. nothing brings this crisis into sharper focus than when you are speaking with a parent who has lost a child, or a family member watching a loved one go through revolving doors of treatment and still be slipping away. this conference report has been a bipartisan, all-hands-on-deck effort reflective of the collaboration we see happening at the grassroots of our communities. i am pleased to see the conference report include the provision my colleague from across the aisle, congressman keating, and i championed in the house legislation to establish coprescribing guidelines for overdose antidotes such as naloxone. i am also pleased with how this legislation gives the proper focus to our veterans. this conference report is a necessary step in moving forward to address this crisis. let us continue to work together to combat this deadly scourge. i urge its passage. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume to close. again, mr. speaker, i will say that, after thoughtful consideration, i not only support the conference report, but i would urge my colleagues on the democratic side to support the conference report. while i continue to believe that we cannot turn the tide on this epidemic without dedicated additional resources for states, the underlying policies included in this bill are important steps forward. as you know, democratic conferees, along with the democratic leadership, have worked tirelessly these past few weeks to try to include money for states to help treat our communities who are suffering. republicans still, so far, refuse to commit the essential funding as part of this overall bill, but they have committed to increasing funding through the appropriations process, and i will continue to fight to ensure that they stand by that commitment. the american people are desperate for relief. we must answer their call and continue our efforts in washington, and one way to do that, certainly, is to pass this conference report. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. upton. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, first i want to thank my friend and partner, mr. pallone. we moved a majority of these bills [[page h4560]] through the committee on a bipartisan basis. we had those votes here on the floor, a very strong vote as the process moved. mr. speaker, this bill is about treatment. it is about prevention. it is about recovery, helping law enforcement, particularly with our drug courts, and it adds new resources to help communities suffering from this terrible opioid epidemic. the comprehensive addiction and recovery act represents the most serious and comprehensive effort ever undertaken by this body to tackle the problem. cara is a bipartisan blend of the best ideas from the house and the senate. these bills passed with a combined 494 votes in the house and the senate and, coupled with the great work led just this week by the house appropriations committee to add $581 million to help fund and prioritize these programs, it shows that we are tackling the problem head-on. now, this is an authorization bill, not an appropriation bill. that is why, coupled with the appropriators, i think that we will get the job done. as i have said, at the end of the day, the money will be there. so those on the front lines fighting the opioid epidemic deserve a strong vote in the people's house. i would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' mr. speaker, i yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. i just want to add my voice and thank mr. upton, as the chair of the conference, and mr. pallone, and all of the conferees, for what i thought was a significant historical moment. we have passed legislation, as a member of the judiciary committee, with no mandatory minimums. our cara bill speaks about grants, helping people overcome their addiction, but more importantly, helping communities. my community alone is suffering from something called kush. that is not heroin, but all of these issues have to be confronted as a health epidemic. i thank the gentleman for accepting my amendment dealing with other drugs, about dealing with a public health epidemic, and i ask for support of the conference report. mr. speaker, i rise to discuss the conference report for s. 524, the comprehensive addiction and recovery act. the conference report is the product of a long process of consultation and hard work between congress and experts and advocates representing a wide range of interests--including victims, addiction treatment specialists, and law enforcement. in many respects, this bill is a compromise--but it does reflect advances in our approach to substance addiction issues. as a member of the bipartisan task force to combat the heroin epidemic i have worked with my colleagues to come together with a comprehensive legislative package to address this national epidemic. i was an original cosponsor of the lead legislative measure and primary contribution of the house judiciary committee, h.r. 5046, the comprehensive opioid abuse reduction act, and i was a cosponsor of the predecessor bill, which is substantially similar to the senate-passed version of s. 524. the text of h.r. 5046 is largely incorporated into the conference report, and would establish a grant program, to be administered by the department of justice, to assist states and local governments, particularly by helping criminal justice agencies to tackle the opioid problem from a variety of angles. it would encourage the development of alternatives to incarceration that provide treatment as a solution to the underlying motivation for criminal behavior or conduct associated with mental disorders. combined with other treatment programs under the jurisdiction of other committees, the approach congress is taking with the crisis of heroin and other opioids is thoughtful and comprehensive. i hope it signals a departure from some of the failed approaches concerning other drug crises in the past. for instance, our response to the surge in crack cocaine in the 1980s was to enact draconian mandatory minimum penalties with vastly disparate treatment for crack and powder cocaine. at that time, congress took action that we are still trying to rectify. at one point, more than 80 percent of the defendants sentenced for crack offenses were african american, despite the fact that more than 66 percent of crack users are white or hispanic. as we work on other legislation to address the enforcement and sentencing disparities related to the crack issue, we must re-examine our approach to that and other drug issues. i am grateful for the assistance of my colleague, bob goodlatte, the chairman of the judiciary committee, for working with me to include in this bill my amendment to express the sense of the congress that an effective and fiscally responsible approach to addressing substance abuse epidemics--no matter which drug is involved--requires treating such epidemics as a public health emergencies emphasizing prevention, treatment, and recovery. provided in section 708 of the report, the sense of congress regarding treatment of substance abuse epidemics expresses that decades of experience and research have demonstrated that a fiscally responsible approach to addressing the opioid abuse epidemic and other substance abuse epidemics requires treating such epidemics as a public health emergency emphasizing prevention, treatment and recovery. indeed, we must adopt a public health approach with regard to substance abuse issues going forward. and i am heartened that, in this bill, we are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory minimums that add to mass incarceration, but we are supporting proven anti-addiction mechanisms. however, the conference committee had the opportunity to do even more--as is necessary given the urgency of the current crisis--and provide real money, right now, to implement the programs the bill authorizes. unfortunately, this bill does not do that and our communities remain in dire need of resources to save lives that are in immediate jeopardy. that is the unfinished business of this effort and we must not rest until we have done all that we can in congress to help protect our communities from opioid abuse. in contrast to the way we are dealing with the opioid crisis is the ill-advised strict ``law-enforcement'' centered approach congress took in addressing crack cocaine crisis in the 1980s that that we are still trying to rectify. at one point, more than 80 percent of the defendants sentenced for crack offenses were african american, despite the fact that more than 66 percent of crack users are white or hispanic. while we are now engaged in a comprehensive ``public health'' approach centered on public health in addressing the crisis involving heroin and other opioids, we must not forget that there is unfinished work to be done to address the enforcement and sentencing disparities related to the crack cocaine. we are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory minimums but we are funding anti-addiction mechanisms such as treatment alternatives to incarceration. we are not adding to mass incarceration--with all of the related and devastating collateral consequences--but instead we are incentivizing state and local governments to prevent, treat, and heal. that is what we should be doing, and that is what we should have done for crack and cocaine addicts. but it is not too late--we should find a way, before this congress adjourns sine die to apply this more comprehensive approach, including treatment alternatives, to those suffering from crack and cocaine addiction. legislation supported by jackson lee 1. regarding bipartisan comprehensive legislation:

[r-wv-2] (introduced 02/09/2016) 31 cosponsors (18 rep, 13 dem) *no sentencing enhancements or penalties mr. upton. mr. speaker, i appreciate the gentlewoman's words. i was very pleased to work with her on the successful amendment that we added in the conference as part of this agreement, and i look for its swift passage today. [[page h4561]] i yield back the balance of my time. mr. van hollen. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the conference report of s. 524, the comprehensive addiction and recovery act (cara). families devastated by opioid addiction deserve action, and this legislation will take some important steps to reduce the toll on our communities. none of our districts is immune to this epidemic that is causing so much death and heartache. the conference report includes elements from both the bipartisan house and senate versions of their respective opioid measures recently approved almost unanimously. it includes provisions that incorporate prevention tactics and expanded access to treatment, recovery support services, and overdose reversals. additionally, the report encourages criminal justice agencies to integrate and sustain medication-assisted treatment (mat) programs. although this report includes vital and much needed measures, we cannot pretend that it will solve the problem. i am disappointed that this legislation does not include adequate funding to fully help us get ahead of this crisis. during conference, my democratic colleagues from both chambers offered amendments that would provide funding for the authorizations within the package. unfortunately, they were turned down, so we must continue to fight for the resources necessary to meaningfully implement this package. i request my colleagues to support this report and to continue to work on a bipartisan basis to provide the resources needed to save lives. the speaker pro tempore. all time

Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come. (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. {time} 1215 Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today. The House will also consider the fiscal year 2017 Interior appropriations bill, sponsored by Representative Calvert. Additionally, the House will consider the Separation of Powers Restoration Act, sponsored by Representative Ratcliffe, as well as three bills related to Iran, thanks to the work of Representatives Pompeo and Royce. The House will also consider the Conscience Protection Act, authored by Representative Diane Black. Mr. Speaker, it is likely that several additional items will be added to the schedule for next week, and Members will be advised of the final schedule as soon as possible. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, normally, the colloquy between the majority leader and myself on the schedule might be lengthier than it will be today. This week has been a sobering week, a sad week. I want to congratulate Speaker Ryan on the comments that he made this morning. He said that ``every Republican and every Democrat wants to see less gun violence.'' He then went on to say: ``Sometimes we disagree on how to get there. Sometimes we disagree passionately on how to get there.'' He went on to say: ``But in having this debate, let's not lose sight of the values that unite us. Let's not lose sight in our common humanity.'' He then said: ``We need to take a moment here for reflection, for thought, for prayer, for justice, for action.'' Mr. Speaker, the majority leader and I have had a brief conversation on the floor. He said to me--and I agree--that we need to sit down together and try to see how we can bring this country and this House together on a way forward to, as the gentlewoman from Texas said, decrease the tensions that exist between citizens and law enforcement officers, to ensure the safety not only of those officers but of Alton Sterling, who lost his life, and of Philando Castile, who lost his life--an instance that appeared to be horrifying and unacceptable. I think all of us in this House and all Americans, Mr. Speaker, like the majority leader has suggested to me--and I have responded--should come together to de-escalate the tensions in our society, the confrontations that we see too often, the rash rhetoric--the hateful rhetoric in some cases--that is being used. I thank the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, for what I believe to be his very sincere and heartfelt thoughts along those lines. So we will not engage in a colloquy today of differences but in a colloquy that will, with prayerful consideration, try to serve the people of this country and each and every individual in this country towards a safer, more assured life in America. I yield to my friend. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his words and our conversation prior. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct. Too many families are mourning losses this week. I believe all Americans are praying for the families--for the innocents who have been murdered in ambush. It is a time for this Nation to heal; it is a time for this Nation to unite; and it is a time for justice to be done. I think, for that to start, this House needs to be an example. I thank the gentleman for being accepting of and for being willing to work together as we have so many times before. As we know in this House, people come from many different parts of this Nation and have expertise. I have sat and had a conversation with Dave Reichert, who has tremendous expertise; and I have had conversations with John Lewis. There is an ability within this House to help this Nation unite and heal the wounds that are out there, and I thank the gentleman for being willing to be a part of that. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments. My hope, Mr. Speaker, is that all of us will be willing to be a part of that solution, not of the problem. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [House] [Page H4564] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

I yield to my friend. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his words and our conversation prior. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct. Too many families are mourning losses this week. I believe all Americans are praying for the families--for the innocents who have been murdered in ambush. It is a time for this Nation to heal; it is a time for this Nation to unite; and it is a time for justice to be done. I think, for that to start, this House needs to be an example. I thank the gentleman for being accepting of and for being willing to work together as we have so many times before. As we know in this House, people come from many different parts of this Nation and have expertise. I have sat and had a conversation with Dave Reichert, who has tremendous expertise; and I have had conversations with John Lewis. There is an ability within this House to help this Nation unite and heal the wounds that are out there, and I thank the gentleman for being willing to be a part of that. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments. My hope, Mr. Speaker, is that all of us will be willing to be a part of that solution, not of the problem. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_251.csv,4921,4921,4987,"[congressional record volume 162, number 110 (friday, july 8, 2016)] [house] [page h4564] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] legislative program (mr. hoyer asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) mr. hoyer. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from california (mr. mccarthy), for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come.

Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as I did 1 year ago, to congratulate the Eden Prairie girls lacrosse team on their high school State championship. The Eagles demonstrated incredible perseverance as they rallied from a five-goal deficit, scoring six of the next seven goals to tie the championship game at halftime. That run, coupled with a very impressive second half defensive display, lifted the Eagles to an 11-9 victory. Co-coaches Judy Baxter and Beth Patterson have every reason to be proud of their team's resilience throughout the season and the tournament. It was the Eagles' strong leadership from their upperclassmen that actually made the team difficult to beat. Leading that offensive effort, senior forward Sara Woodring scored two goals and had five assists; and senior defender Payton Borg led the Eagles' defense, allowing only two goals in the second half. Mr. Speaker, achieving a high school State championship title is an impressive accomplishment, but even more admirable is the Eagles' ability to maintain a commitment throughout the season to their schoolwork and other obligations outside of the classroom. The team's parents, teachers, and fellow Eagle students are very proud of their accomplishments.

Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I was impressed this week with the release of the long-awaited Chilcot report from the United Kingdom's inquiry into the Iraq war. While the main conclusions of the report should be familiar to all of us--that the U.S. and Britain justified the invasion of Iraq with flawed and manipulated intelligence and that subsequent preparations for post-invasion Iraq were woefully inadequate and mismanaged--it is, nonetheless, an overdue public accountability of British leadership and a detailed and searing rebuke that no member of the Bush administration has ever undergone. During his news conference, Mr. Blair said: ``I express more sorrow, regret, and apology than you can ever believe.'' Mr. Speaker, what is the chance that we will ever hear those same remorseful and contemplative words from Mr. Bush? Mr. Cheney? Mr. Rumsfeld? It is virtually nonexistent. God forgive us and them for our indifference. Iraq never will. Mr. Speaker, I was impressed this week with the release of the long- awaited Chilcot Report, the United Kingdom's inquiry into the Iraq War. While the main conclusions of the report should be familiar to all of us by now--that the U.S. and Britain justified the invasion of Iraq on both flawed and manipulated intelligence and that subsequent preparations for post-invasion Iraq were woefully inadequate and mismanaged--it is nonetheless an overdue public accountability of British leadership, a detailed and searing rebuke that no member of the Bush administration has ever undergone. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 was the worst foreign policy decision ever made by an American president, a decision that cost the U.S. trillions of dollars and that led to the deaths of over a million people, including 4,500 American servicemembers and scores of Iraqis. Moreover, the ripple effect across the Middle East from that single event 13 years ago has been brutal and violent, spawning terrorist groups like ISIS and miring U.S. foreign policy in a region we continue to misunderstand. For me, and for a number of others in this chamber who boldly spoke against the war before it even began, this report has enormous resonance. And it was cathartic to watch former Prime Minister Tony Blair's news conference, where he appeared if not exactly repentant, at least deeply affected by the report's scathing criticism. President Bush and the other architects of the war have never deigned to present themselves before the public to explain, much less atone for, their actions and decisions. Meanwhile, House Republicans have been far more determined to waste this body's time and resources investigating Benghazi, Hillary Clinton's emails, or the IRS rather than the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last quarter century. Indifference, Mr. Speaker. That's what the Iraq War has amounted to: a regrettable blip on an otherwise sterling American reputation abroad. That's what President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Secretary Rumsfeld, and the rest of the political elite who enabled their actions would have you believe. But while they continue to enjoy their comfortable retirement, free of punishment or official censure, Iraq continues to burn. Perhaps you think a Chilcot Report of our own would be futile, now that the American people popularly regard the Iraq War as a profound mistake. But public censures have their uses, not the least being that they serve as a warning to those who would forget or ignore our past missteps. An American Chilcot Report would certainly check those voices now calling for increased military action in Iraq and Syria. Over the past 5 days, during the final week of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, over 320 people have been killed in Baghdad. This is just the latest of Iraq's horrors, Mr. Speaker, horrors that we wrought with our senseless and criminal invasion 13 years ago. During his news conference, Mr. Blair said ``I express more sorrow, regret and apology than you can ever believe.'' Mr. Speaker, the chances of ever hearing the same remorseful and contemplative words from Bush, Cheney, or Rumsfeld are virtually non- existent.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the First [[Page H4567]] Amendment Defense Act and the importance of defending religious liberties in America. And I don't know that there has ever been a greater time for us to address this than right now. We have, unfortunately, become accustomed in this country of the news similar to what we woke up to this morning where we see one tragedy after another. Certainly racial tensions are extremely high in this country. Anger is high. We face a number of other issues across this country, like greed and self-centeredness, a disregard for authority and personal property and the rule of law. We see corruption in so many different places, including our government at all levels, be it on the local level, the State, or here on the national level as well. {time} 1245 Things like immorality and abuse. And, yes, we hear a lot these days, especially days like today, a lot of people talking about gun violence. But, Mr. Speaker, I am convinced at the core of my being that we cannot address these type of issues by turning our backs on God and by kicking God out of the public square. And, yet, we are seeing an increase of hostility in this country toward people of faith and the right that people have under the First Amendment to express those beliefs in the public square without fear of intimidation, without fear of being punished by our government. Mr. Speaker, all of this concerns me greatly, and I know it concerns many people not only in the people's House, but all across our Nation. I think many people don't realize that, even according to the Scriptures, the institutions of family, as well as church and government, have been instituted by God. These are not creations of man. And I think many of us, Mr. Speaker, forget the reality of this. In fact, the reason that government was created by God in the first place is because He knew that we, as human beings, need boundaries within which to live, and those boundaries actually comprise a civil society. And so we have government given to us as a great gift to enable us to have a tangible understanding of right and wrong and the boundaries within which to live, and if we get outside those boundaries, government is there for correction and to keep us within certain boundaries of behavior. That is what comprises a civil society. But, of course, the problem of all of this, Mr. Speaker, is that we realize that government itself is comprised of human beings, and if human beings within government themselves are corrupt, then everyone suffers; and so it becomes extremely important for us to understand the purpose of government and why it exists and why it has such an influence on all of our lives. On the other side, I guess, of the coin--perhaps not totally the other side, but certainly within the context of this discussion--is, in fact, people of faith. Mr. Speaker, I have been involved in this battle personally for very closely, nearly 15 years, but I find these days people of faith are very much intimidated, scared to get involved. And there are all sorts of reasons for this. I hear all kinds of excuses, but some of the bigger excuses that I hear frequently is people say we have that separation of church and State. Of course, we know, Mr. Speaker, that that is not in the Constitution, and, yet, we have heard it over and over and over and over to the extent that many people today actually believe that there is a separation that prohibits people of faith from being involved, be it in government or in multiple other avenues and areas of our society. And so that kind of erroneous thinking has an impact on something like the First Amendment and the right of the people to have belief and belief of conscience, and the right to exercise those beliefs publicly; but I also see, indeed, because of the growing hostility that is becoming more and more evident, that people are fearful of our government. People are fearful to stand up. There are multiple examples, multiple examples. I had a radio program for 12 years and I dealt with this type of thing on a regular basis, but the examples go everywhere from a baker to photographers, some of whom have actually lost their businesses because they chose to stand on their First Amendment right to exercise their businesses according to the dictates of their faith, and they have ended up losing their businesses. We have examples of valedictorians scared to offer a prayer or to express their beliefs in their valedictorian speech. We have workplace intimidation. We could go on and on and on, Mr. Speaker, a long time, talking about this, but the concern is highlighted by judicial leanings that we are seeing these days. I think it is more important now than ever that we understand that the First Amendment is the first amendment. It is our first liberty. It is the foundation upon which so much else rests. If the First Amendment is altered or chipped away at continually, then I am fearful that our entire Nation will suffer massive consequences and change as a result. Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a few moments to not only support the First Amendment Defense Act and the importance of defending religious liberties, but I think within that understanding, that context, now more than ever with the issues that we are watching, I want to kind of draw a word picture of why this is so important and why our Founders, why our Nation was actually established on these principles that we seem today so willingly to walk away from. But we have, I believe, a moral obligation to defend our First Amendment and to defend the rights of people to believe what they believe and to exercise those beliefs publicly without fear of intimidation, let alone punishment. I go all the way back to begin with, Mr. Speaker, our very first President, George Washington. Many of us probably had to memorize portions of his Farewell Address, but, you know, I have tried to place myself in that context many times, and the reality is that many within our country, when Washington was stepping down, were fearful. We had never had another President in our country at that time, and George Washington had done a superb job. People were anxious of the thought of him leaving, and it had never happened. We had never passed the baton from one President to another at that time. Washington, in his Farewell Address, Mr. Speaker, made this statement: ``Of all the dispositions and habits that lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.'' Indispensable. Those are strong words: indispensable supports, religion and morality. He went on, Mr. Speaker, and he said this--and I think a lot of people overlook this comment, but he said: ``In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness.'' In other words, Mr. Speaker, I believe it is totally fair to say that George Washington, in his Farewell Address, literally stated that you could not claim to be a patriot if you didn't understand the role of religion and morality in American culture and those indispensable pillars upon which our Nation rests. Amazing words that, unfortunately, we tend to overlook. Well, George Washington did pass the baton, and for the first time in our Nation's history we had another leader. His name was John Adams. Many of us know a lot about John Adams and some of the things that he did and said, but probably one of the most famous quotes from Adams was this one, Mr. Speaker--and if this paper here represents the Constitution, it was Adams who said: ``Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.'' I think those are enormously significant words. I mean, we all know that our Constitution basically is a contract. It is a contract between our government and we, the people; and that contract says that our government is not going to be overly intrusive into our lives, that we will have limited government and maximum freedom. That is the contract. John Adams said that that contract, that Constitution, was written for a moral and religious people, that it is totally inadequate for the government of any other. So, Mr. Speaker, I recall--it has been several years ago now--I was actually in a meeting with Governor Huckabee, [[Page H4568]] and he made a statement that for years now has just bubbled inside me, and it actually has become a changing moment in my life to understand what our Founders meant when they gave us the importance of religion and morality. But let's suppose we have two towns, a town A and a town B. Let's just suppose, Mr. Speaker, that town A is what we may refer to as a secular town. It is a town that, for the most part, has ignored the role of religion and morality. They, more or less, have kicked God out of the public square. What kind of behavior would we expect, Mr. Speaker, from town A here? Well, if we ponder that and if we look historically at this type of scenario, we will find that this type of society, for the most part, has greater incidence of things like violence, robbery, crime, gang violence, broken families, and all these types of things seem to go on the rise. Now, here is the important question, Mr. Speaker, that I think we have got to address when we are looking at something like this: What is the role of government toward town A? Well, if you think about it, of necessity, government must be very much involved in town A because there are so many problems here. We need more law enforcement because we have got so much more crime. We need more judges because we have got all these different things that are happening here, and there are conflicts between one another. Of necessity, government must be very much involved in town A. Now, let's go over here to town B. Let's just suppose town B is a town that, for the most part, has embraced a Judeo-Christian worldview, much like our Founders gave us. Many people here representing this House of Representatives probably grew up in a town B. I like to refer to this as a Mayberry type of a town. Not that everyone in town B is a person of faith or a religious person, but there is a certain worldview that is embraced in this town that embraces, that is accepted within this culture, this community, things like the Golden Rule, where we are going to treat one another the way we ourselves want to be treated. Now, let's just say, for example, that this town B accepts certain values along those things. Now, what kind of behavior do we expect out of town B? Well, not everyone over here is perfect by any means, but overall, many of us can go back and we can look 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, the difference of life then compared to life now, when we did have more of a town B-type understanding in our country, and there was less crime. Families did stay together more. We didn't suffer with the same extent of issues like gang violence, drug and alcohol abuse, and these type of things. So, Mr. Speaker, now the question is: What is the response of government to town B? Well, it is not nearly as great. The reason being, Mr. Speaker, the primary difference between these is what I believe our Founders gave us. In town B you have a group of people who are capable of self- governing their own lives with an authentic understanding of right and wrong because there is deeply held religious, moral convictions that dictate the conduct of these individuals. I believe it is totally fair to say that I believe our Founders gave us the indispensable pillars of religion and morality because they understood that it is only within this context that we can have limited government. The role of government in this town is much less because you have self-governing people, and it is only within a context of self- governance that we are able to have limited government. Thereby, the understanding of the statement by John Adams that says our Constitution, that contract of limited government--John Adams said our Constitution was written for a moral and religious people; it is totally inadequate for a government of any other. Mr. Speaker, it is my conviction, and I believe consistent with our Founders, to say that it is impossible to have limited government in a secular society. I don't know that that is even a possibility. {time} 1300 So we, as Members of this House and this governing body, be it Federal or on the State level or even local level, have a moral obligation to defend our First Amendment, because therein grows the roots of religion and morality that are absolutely essential to our system and form of government. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for us also to be reminded that we have a tremendous religious heritage in this country that has carried us faithfully since our founding that we must not depart from. I remember coming across a statement a few years ago. In fact, this was in 1950. I would be curious to know, Mr. Speaker, how many of my colleagues were alive in 1950, but I would venture to say it is quite a number. I came across a court ruling by the Supreme Court of the State of Florida. It was a decision that they made in 1950. In that decision, Mr. Speaker, the Florida Supreme Court actually made this statement. By the way, they were referring to our Founders. But that court in Florida said: A people unschooled about the sovereignty of God, the ethics of Jesus, and the Ten Commandments, could never have evolved the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, or the Constitution. They went on and said: There is not one, solitary, fundamental principle of our democratic policy that did not stem directly from the basic moral concepts embodied in the Ten Commandments. Mr. Speaker, I read that. In our lifetime, and that of many Representatives, a State supreme court was making a comment like that. I compare it to this. I cannot imagine any court in America making a decision with those kinds of words. They would be ruled unconstitutional quicker than we could imagine. Yet, in our lifetime, we had State supreme courts making decisions such as this. My, we have come a long, long way from understanding the role that religion and morality play in supporting our entire system of governance. Mr. Speaker, as I begin to land the plane here and wind down, I am just reminded, of course, that many know that I have been a pastor for many years. So this whole issue is very, very close to me personally. People of faith understand that they have a responsibility, according to the Scripture, to be salt and light in the world in which they live. Regardless of what country--anywhere in the world--we have a Biblical mandate to be salt and light in our world, and I take that very seriously. So, when we see our First Amendment rights being challenged or chipped away, it is an alarming thing, because we have a responsibility, in accordance with our faith, to take a stand for those things which we believe, and to do so out loud. Just from that perspective, Mr. Speaker, it is alarming. But the beautiful thing is, here in America, we are blessed to live in a nation where our system of government does not work without involvement from the people. Our whole system is reliant on the people of this great country to step up to the plate and engage it. That is the concept behind those powerful words, ``we, the people.'' This is our country. It is our turf. It is we, the people. So, we have a system of government that does not work unless we, the people, get involved in one capacity or another, whether it is voting or whether it is running for office or a million other things to be done in between. That is the way our system works. Mr. Speaker, I want to just emphasize the importance that we have to maintain those principles that allow all of us, regardless of religious beliefs, regardless of those who have no religious beliefs, but also remembering those who do have religious beliefs, that this is a country where the First Amendment protects all of us. This is a country where the First Amendment Defense Act applies to all of us. Mr. Speaker, I want to close with a quote. Right out these doors is Statuary Hall. Sometime back late one evening, I had some spare moments, and I came back over here to the Capitol and was walking alone. I was virtually all by myself here in these great Halls. I went into Statuary Hall, and I started reading and going to one statue after another. I went around reading about those individuals, and I came to one, James Garfield. Mr. Speaker, many people don't know much about Garfield these days, but he is the only minister to ever be elected President of the United States of America. I stood before that statue and I looked at him and, Mr. Speaker, I was [[Page H4569]] reminded of a statement. I actually have come to be a great admirer of Garfield. It seems to me that everything I have read from him has been powerful. He seemed to have a keen awareness and understanding of the role of what I am talking about today: the role of religion and morality in American society and culture and our entire system of government. Garfield made this statement, Mr. Speaker, and I believe it is more applicable today than it has been in any day in which we have lived. Here is what he said: ``Now more than ever before, the people are responsible for the character of their Congress. If that body be ignorant, reckless and corrupt, it is because the people tolerate ignorance, recklessness and corruption. If it be intelligent, brave and pure, it is because the people demand these qualities to represent them in the national legislature.'' Then, he said this, Mr. Speaker: ``If the next centennial does not find us a great nation . . . it will be because those who represent the enterprise, the culture, and the morality of the nation do not aid in controlling the political forces.'' What a powerful statement. Mr. Speaker, being reminded of that statement, I would ask us today: How can we, the people be involved, be it in the enterprise, the culture, or the morality of the Nation? How can we, as Garfield said, be involved in controlling the political forces if we do not have the First Amendment protections to do so? How can we be engaged if we continue to chip away at the right of people to believe what they believe and to exercise those beliefs within the public square without fear of intimidation or punishment? Mr. Speaker, I believe now more than ever is the time for us not to chip away at our First Amendment rights, but to defend them and protect them and ensure that those rights are maintained for all Americans now and for the next generation and for as long as this Nation exist. Mr. Speaker, as the First Amendment Defense Act comes before this body in the weeks to come, I hope and pray that we will stand behind it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [House] [Pages H4566-H4569] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEFENDING RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Many of us probably had to memorize portions of his Farewell Address, but, you know, I have tried to place myself in that context many times, and the reality is that many within our country, when Washington was stepping down, were fearful. We had never had another President in our country at that time, and George Washington had done a superb job. People were anxious of the thought of him leaving, and it had never happened. We had never passed the baton from one President to another at that time. Washington, in his Farewell Address, Mr. Speaker, made this statement: ``Of all the dispositions and habits that lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.'' Indispensable. Those are strong words: indispensable supports, religion and morality. He went on, Mr. Speaker, and he said this--and I think a lot of people overlook this comment, but he said: ``In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness.'' In other words, Mr. Speaker, I believe it is totally fair to say that George Washington, in his Farewell Address, literally stated that you could not claim to be a patriot if you didn't understand the role of religion and morality in American culture and those indispensable pillars upon which our Nation rests. Amazing words that, unfortunately, we tend to overlook. Well, George Washington did pass the baton, and for the first time in our Nation's history we had another leader. His name was John Adams. Many of us know a lot about John Adams and some of the things that he did and said, but probably one of the most famous quotes from Adams was this one, Mr. Speaker--and if this paper here represents the Constitution, it was Adams who said: ``Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.'' I think those are enormously significant words. I mean, we all know that our Constitution basically is a contract. It is a contract between our government and we, the people; and that contract says that our government is not going to be overly intrusive into our lives, that we will have limited government and maximum freedom. That is the contract. John Adams said that that contract, that Constitution, was written for a moral and religious people, that it is totally inadequate for the government of any other. So, Mr. Speaker, I recall--it has been several years ago now--I was actually in a meeting with Governor Huckabee, [[Page H4568]] and he made a statement that for years now has just bubbled inside me, and it actually has become a changing moment in my life to understand what our Founders meant when they gave us the importance of religion and morality. But let's suppose we have two towns, a town A and a town B. Let's just suppose, Mr. Speaker, that town A is what we may refer to as a secular town. It is a town that, for the most part, has ignored the role of religion and morality. They, more or less, have kicked God out of the public square. What kind of behavior would we expect, Mr. Speaker, from town A here? Well, if we ponder that and if we look historically at this type of scenario, we will find that this type of society, for the most part, has greater incidence of things like violence, robbery, crime, gang violence, broken families, and all these types of things seem to go on the rise. Now, here is the important question, Mr. Speaker, that I think we have got to address when we are looking at something like this: What is the role of government toward town A? Well, if you think about it, of necessity, government must be very much involved in town A because there are so many problems here. We need more law enforcement because we have got so much more crime. We need more judges because we have got all these different things that are happening here, and there are conflicts between one another. Of necessity, government must be very much involved in town A. Now, let's go over here to town B. Let's just suppose town B is a town that, for the most part, has embraced a Judeo-Christian worldview, much like our Founders gave us. Many people here representing this House of Representatives probably grew up in a town B. I like to refer to this as a Mayberry type of a town. Not that everyone in town B is a person of faith or a religious person, but there is a certain worldview that is embraced in this town that embraces, that is accepted within this culture, this community, things like the Golden Rule, where we are going to treat one another the way we ourselves want to be treated. Now, let's just say, for example, that this town B accepts certain values along those things. Now, what kind of behavior do we expect out of town B? Well, not everyone over here is perfect by any means, but overall, many of us can go back and we can look 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, the difference of life then compared to life now, when we did have more of a town B-type understanding in our country, and there was less crime. Families did stay together more. We didn't suffer with the same extent of issues like gang violence, drug and alcohol abuse, and these type of things. So, Mr. Speaker, now the question is: What is the response of government to town B? Well, it is not nearly as great. The reason being, Mr. Speaker, the primary difference between these is what I believe our Founders gave us. In town B you have a group of people who are capable of self- governing their own lives with an authentic understanding of right and wrong because there is deeply held religious, moral convictions that dictate the conduct of these individuals. I believe it is totally fair to say that I believe our Founders gave us the indispensable pillars of religion and morality because they understood that it is only within this context that we can have limited government. The role of government in this town is much less because you have self-governing people, and it is only within a context of self- governance that we are able to have limited government. Thereby, the understanding of the statement by John Adams that says our Constitution, that contract of limited government--John Adams said our Constitution was written for a moral and religious people; it is totally inadequate for a government of any other. Mr. Speaker, it is my conviction, and I believe consistent with our Founders, to say that it is impossible to have limited government in a secular society. I don't know that that is even a possibility. {time} 1300 So we, as Members of this House and this governing body, be it Federal or on the State level or even local level, have a moral obligation to defend our First Amendment, because therein grows the roots of religion and morality that are absolutely essential to our system and form of government. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for us also to be reminded that we have a tremendous religious heritage in this country that has carried us faithfully since our founding that we must not depart from. I remember coming across a statement a few years ago. In fact, this was in 1950. I would be curious to know, Mr. Speaker, how many of my colleagues were alive in 1950, but I would venture to say it is quite a number. I came across a court ruling by the Supreme Court of the State of Florida. It was a decision that they made in 1950. In that decision, Mr. Speaker, the Florida Supreme Court actually made this statement. By the way, they were referring to our Founders. But that court in Florida said: A people unschooled about the sovereignty of God, the ethics of Jesus, and the Ten Commandments, could never have evolved the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, or the Constitution. They went on and said: There is not one, solitary, fundamental principle of our democratic policy that did not stem directly from the basic moral concepts embodied in the Ten Commandments. Mr. Speaker, I read that. In our lifetime, and that of many Representatives, a State supreme court was making a comment like that. I compare it to this. I cannot imagine any court in America making a decision with those kinds of words. They would be ruled unconstitutional quicker than we could imagine. Yet, in our lifetime, we had State supreme courts making decisions such as this. My, we have come a long, long way from understanding the role that religion and morality play in supporting our entire system of governance. Mr. Speaker, as I begin to land the plane here and wind down, I am just reminded, of course, that many know that I have been a pastor for many years. So this whole issue is very, very close to me personally. People of faith understand that they have a responsibility, according to the Scripture, to be salt and light in the world in which they live. Regardless of what country--anywhere in the world--we have a Biblical mandate to be salt and light in our world, and I take that very seriously. So, when we see our First Amendment rights being challenged or chipped away, it is an alarming thing, because we have a responsibility, in accordance with our faith, to take a stand for those things which we believe, and to do so out loud. Just from that perspective, Mr. Speaker, it is alarming. But the beautiful thing is, here in America, we are blessed to live in a nation where our system of government does not work without involvement from the people. Our whole system is reliant on the people of this great country to step up to the plate and engage it. That is the concept behind those powerful words, ``we, the people.'' This is our country. It is our turf. It is we, the people. So, we have a system of government that does not work unless we, the people, get involved in one capacity or another, whether it is voting or whether it is running for office or a million other things to be done in between. That is the way our system works. Mr. Speaker, I want to just emphasize the importance that we have to maintain those principles that allow all of us, regardless of religious beliefs, regardless of those who have no religious beliefs, but also remembering those who do have religious beliefs, that this is a country where the First Amendment protects all of us. This is a country where the First Amendment Defense Act applies to all of us. Mr. Speaker, I want to close with a quote. Right out these doors is Statuary Hall. Sometime back late one evening, I had some spare moments, and I came back over here to the Capitol and was walking alone. I was virtually all by myself here in these great Halls. I went into Statuary Hall, and I started reading and going to one statue after another. I went around reading about those individuals, and I came to one, James Garfield. Mr. Speaker, many people don't know much about Garfield these days, but he is the only minister to ever be elected President of the United States of America. I stood before that statue and I looked at him and, Mr. Speaker, I was [[Page H4569]] reminded of a statement. I actually have come to be a great admirer of Garfield. It seems to me that everything I have read from him has been powerful. He seemed to have a keen awareness and understanding of the role of what I am talking about today: the role of religion and morality in American society and culture and our entire system of government. Garfield made this statement, Mr. Speaker, and I believe it is more applicable today than it has been in any day in which we have lived. Here is what he said: ``Now more than ever before, the people are responsible for the character of their Congress. If that body be ignorant, reckless and corrupt, it is because the people tolerate ignorance, recklessness and corruption. If it be intelligent, brave and pure, it is because the people demand these qualities to represent them in the national legislature.'' Then, he said this, Mr. Speaker: ``If the next centennial does not find us a great nation . . . it will be because those who represent the enterprise, the culture, and the morality of the nation do not aid in controlling the political forces.'' What a powerful statement. Mr. Speaker, being reminded of that statement, I would ask us today: How can we, the people be involved, be it in the enterprise, the culture, or the morality of the Nation? How can we, as Garfield said, be involved in controlling the political forces if we do not have the First Amendment protections to do so? How can we be engaged if we continue to chip away at the right of people to believe what they believe and to exercise those beliefs within the public square without fear of intimidation or punishment? Mr. Speaker, I believe now more than ever is the time for us not to chip away at our First Amendment rights, but to defend them and protect them and ensure that those rights are maintained for all Americans now and for the next generation and for as long as this Nation exist. Mr. Speaker, as the First Amendment Defense Act comes before this body in the weeks to come, I hope and pray that we will stand behind it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [House] [Pages H4566-H4569] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEFENDING RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the First [[Page H4567]] Amendment Defense Act and the importance of defending religious liberties in America. And I don't know that there has ever been a greater time for us to address this than right now. We have, unfortunately, become accustomed in this country of the news similar to what we woke up to this morning where we see one tragedy after another. Certainly racial tensions are extremely high in this country. Anger is high. We face a number of other issues across this country, like greed and self-centeredness, a disregard for authority and personal property and the rule of law. We see corruption in so many different places, including our government at all levels, be it on the local level, the State, or here on the national level as well. {time} 1245 Things like immorality and abuse. And, yes, we hear a lot these days, especially days like today, a lot of people talking about gun violence. But, Mr. Speaker, I am convinced at the core of my being that we cannot address these type of issues by turning our backs on God and by kicking God out of the public square. And, yet, we are seeing an increase of hostility in this country toward people of faith and the right that people have under the First Amendment to express those beliefs in the public square without fear of intimidation, without fear of being punished by our government. Mr. Speaker, all of this concerns me greatly, and I know it concerns many people not only in the people's House, but all across our Nation. I think many people don't realize that, even according to the Scriptures, the institutions of family, as well as church and government, have been instituted by God. These are not creations of man. And I think many of us, Mr. Speaker, forget the reality of this. In fact, the reason that government was created by God in the first place is because He knew that we, as human beings, need boundaries within which to live, and those boundaries actually comprise a civil society. And so we have government given to us as a great gift to enable us to have a tangible understanding of right and wrong and the boundaries within which to live, and if we get outside those boundaries, government is there for correction and to keep us within certain boundaries of behavior. That is what comprises a civil society. But, of course, the problem of all of this, Mr. Speaker, is that we realize that government itself is comprised of human beings, and if human beings within government themselves are corrupt, then everyone suffers; and so it becomes extremely important for us to understand the purpose of government and why it exists and why it has such an influence on all of our lives. On the other side, I guess, of the coin--perhaps not totally the other side, but certainly within the context of this discussion--is, in fact, people of faith. Mr. Speaker, I have been involved in this battle personally for very closely, nearly 15 years, but I find these days people of faith are very much intimidated, scared to get involved. And there are all sorts of reasons for this. I hear all kinds of excuses, but some of the bigger excuses that I hear frequently is people say we have that separation of church and State. Of course, we know, Mr. Speaker, that that is not in the Constitution, and, yet, we have heard it over and over and over and over to the extent that many people today actually believe that there is a separation that prohibits people of faith from being involved, be it in government or in multiple other avenues and areas of our society. And so that kind of erroneous thinking has an impact on something like the First Amendment and the right of the people to have belief and belief of conscience, and the right to exercise those beliefs publicly; but I also see, indeed, because of the growing hostility that is becoming more and more evident, that people are fearful of our government. People are fearful to stand up. There are multiple examples, multiple examples. I had a radio program for 12 years and I dealt with this type of thing on a regular basis, but the examples go everywhere from a baker to photographers, some of whom have actually lost their businesses because they chose to stand on their First Amendment right to exercise their businesses according to the dictates of their faith, and they have ended up losing their businesses. We have examples of valedictorians scared to offer a prayer or to express their beliefs in their valedictorian speech. We have workplace intimidation. We could go on and on and on, Mr. Speaker, a long time, talking about this, but the concern is highlighted by judicial leanings that we are seeing these days. I think it is more important now than ever that we understand that the First Amendment is the first amendment. It is our first liberty. It is the foundation upon which so much else rests. If the First Amendment is altered or chipped away at continually, then I am fearful that our entire Nation will suffer massive consequences and change as a result. Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a few moments to not only support the First Amendment Defense Act and the importance of defending religious liberties, but I think within that understanding, that context, now more than ever with the issues that we are watching, I want to kind of draw a word picture of why this is so important and why our Founders, why our Nation was actually established on these principles that we seem today so willingly to walk away from. But we have, I believe, a moral obligation to defend our First Amendment and to defend the rights of people to believe what they believe and to exercise those beliefs publicly without fear of intimidation, let alone punishment. I go all the way back to begin with, Mr. Speaker, our very first President, George Washington.

context of this discussion--is, in fact, people of faith. mr. speaker, i have been involved in this battle personally for very closely, nearly 15 years, but i find these days people of faith are very much intimidated, scared to get involved. and there are all sorts of reasons for this. i hear all kinds of excuses, but some of the bigger excuses that i hear frequently is people say we have that separation of church and state. of course, we know, mr. speaker, that that is not in the constitution, and, yet, we have heard it over and over and over and over to the extent that many people today actually believe that there is a separation that prohibits people of faith from being involved, be it in government or in multiple other avenues and areas of our society. and so that kind of erroneous thinking has an impact on something like the first amendment and the right of the people to have belief and belief of conscience, and the right to exercise those beliefs publicly; but i also see, indeed, because of the growing hostility that is becoming more and more evident, that people are fearful of our government. people are fearful to stand up. there are multiple examples, multiple examples. i had a radio program for 12 years and i dealt with this type of thing on a regular basis, but the examples go everywhere from a baker to photographers, some of whom have actually lost their businesses because they chose to stand on their first amendment right to exercise their businesses according to the dictates of their faith, and they have ended up losing their businesses. we have examples of valedictorians scared to offer a prayer or to express their beliefs in their valedictorian speech. we have workplace intimidation. we could go on and on and on, mr. speaker, a long time, talking about this, but the concern is highlighted by judicial leanings that we are seeing these days. i think it is more important now than ever that we understand that the first amendment is the first amendment. it is our first liberty. it is the foundation upon which so much else rests. if the first amendment is altered or chipped away at continually, then i am fearful that our entire nation will suffer massive consequences and change as a result. mr. speaker, i just want to take a few moments to not only support the first amendment defense act and the importance of defending religious liberties, but i think within that understanding, that context, now more than ever with the issues that we are watching, i want to kind of draw a word picture of why this is so important and why our founders, why our nation was actually established on these principles that we seem today so willingly to walk away from. but we have, i believe, a moral obligation to defend our first amendment and to defend the rights of people to believe what they believe and to exercise those beliefs publicly without fear of intimidation, let alone punishment. i go all the way back to begin with, mr. speaker, our very first president, george washington. many of us probably had to memorize portions of his farewell address, but, you know, i have tried to place myself in that context many times, and the reality is that many within our country, when washington was stepping down, were fearful. we had never had another president in our country at that time, and george washington had done a superb job. people were anxious of the thought of him leaving, and it had never happened. we had never passed the baton from one president to another at that time. washington, in his farewell address, mr. speaker, made this statement: ``of all the dispositions and habits that lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.'' indispensable. those are strong words: indispensable supports, religion and morality. he went on, mr. speaker, and he said this--and i think a lot of people overlook this comment, but he said: ``in vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness.'' in other words, mr. speaker, i believe it is totally fair to say that george washington, in his farewell address, literally stated that you could not claim to be a patriot if you didn't understand the role of religion and morality in american culture and those indispensable pillars upon which our nation rests. amazing words that, unfortunately, we tend to overlook. well, george washington did pass the baton, and for the first time in our nation's history we had another leader. his name was john adams. many of us know a lot about john adams and some of the things that he did and said, but probably one of the most famous quotes from adams was this one, mr. speaker--and if this paper here represents the constitution, it was adams who said: ``our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.'' i think those are enormously significant words. i mean, we all know that our constitution basically is a contract. it is a contract between our government and we, the people; and that contract says that our government is not going to be overly intrusive into our lives, that we will have limited government and maximum freedom. that is the contract. john adams said that that contract, that constitution, was written for a moral and religious people, that it is totally inadequate for the government of any other. so, mr. speaker, i recall--it has been several years ago now--i was actually in a meeting with governor huckabee, [[page h4568]] and he made a statement that for years now has just bubbled inside me, and it actually has become a changing moment in my life to understand what our founders meant when they gave us the importance of religion and morality. but let's suppose we have two towns, a town a and a town b. let's just suppose, mr. speaker, that town a is what we may refer to as a secular town. it is a town that, for the most part, has ignored the role of religion and morality. they, more or less, have kicked god out of the public square. what kind of behavior would we expect, mr. speaker, from town a here? well, if we ponder that and if we look historically at this type of scenario, we will find that this type of society, for the most part, has greater incidence of things like violence, robbery, crime, gang violence, broken families, and all these types of things seem to go on the rise. now, here is the important question, mr. speaker, that i think we have got to address when we are looking at something like this: what is the role of government toward town a? well, if you think about it, of necessity, government must be very much involved in town a because there are so many problems here. we need more law enforcement because we have got so much more crime. we need more judges because we have got all these different things that are happening here, and there are conflicts between one another. of necessity, government must be very much involved in town a. now, let's go over here to town b. let's just suppose town b is a town that, for the most part, has embraced a judeo-christian worldview, much like our founders gave us. many people here representing this house of representatives probably grew up in a town b. i like to refer to this as a mayberry type of a town. not that everyone in town b is a person of faith or a religious person, but there is a certain worldview that is embraced in this town that embraces, that is accepted within this culture, this community, things like the golden rule, where we are going to treat one another the way we ourselves want to be treated. now, let's just say, for example, that this town b accepts certain values along those things. now, what kind of behavior do we expect out of town b? well, not everyone over here is perfect by any means, but overall, many of us can go back and we can look 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, the difference of life then compared to life now, when we did have more of a town b-type understanding in our country, and there was less crime. families did stay together more. we didn't suffer with the same extent of issues like gang violence, drug and alcohol abuse, and these type of things. so, mr. speaker, now the question is: what is the response of government to town b? well, it is not nearly as great. the reason being, mr. speaker, the primary difference between these is what i believe our founders gave us. in town b you have a group of people who are capable of self- governing their own lives with an authentic understanding of right and wrong because there is deeply held religious, moral convictions that dictate the conduct of these individuals. i believe it is totally fair to say that i believe our founders gave us the indispensable pillars of religion and morality because they understood that it is only within this context that we can have limited government. the role of government in this town is much less because you have self-governing people, and it is only within a context of self- governance that we are able to have limited government. thereby, the understanding of the statement by john adams that says our constitution, that contract of limited government--john adams said our constitution was written for a moral and religious people; it is totally inadequate for a government of any other. mr. speaker, it is my conviction, and i believe consistent with our founders, to say that it is impossible to have limited government in a secular society. i don't know that that is even a possibility. {time} 1300 so we, as members of this house and this governing body, be it federal or on the state level or even local level, have a moral obligation to defend our first amendment, because therein grows the roots of religion and morality that are absolutely essential to our system and form of government. mr. speaker, i think it is important for us also to be reminded that we have a tremendous religious heritage in this country that has carried us faithfully since our founding that we must not depart from. i remember coming across a statement a few years ago. in fact, this was in 1950. i would be curious to know, mr. speaker, how many of my colleagues were alive in 1950, but i would venture to say it is quite a number. i came across a court ruling by the supreme court of the state of florida. it was a decision that they made in 1950. in that decision, mr. speaker, the florida supreme court actually made this statement. by the way, they were referring to our founders. but that court in florida said: a people unschooled about the sovereignty of god, the ethics of jesus, and the ten commandments, could never have evolved the bill of rights, the declaration of independence, or the constitution. they went on and said: there is not one, solitary, fundamental principle of our democratic policy that did not stem directly from the basic moral concepts embodied in the ten commandments. mr. speaker, i read that. in our lifetime, and that of many representatives, a state supreme court was making a comment like that. i compare it to this. i cannot imagine any court in america making a decision with those kinds of words. they would be ruled unconstitutional quicker than we could imagine. yet, in our lifetime, we had state supreme courts making decisions such as this. my, we have come a long, long way from understanding the role that religion and morality play in supporting our entire system of governance. mr. speaker, as i begin to land the plane here and wind down, i am just reminded, of course, that many know that i have been a pastor for many years. so this whole issue is very, very close to me personally. people of faith understand that they have a responsibility, according to the scripture, to be salt and light in the world in which they live. regardless of what country--anywhere in the world--we have a biblical mandate to be salt and light in our world, and i take that very seriously. so, when we see our first amendment rights being challenged or chipped away, it is an alarming thing, because we have a responsibility, in accordance with our faith, to take a stand for those things which we believe, and to do so out loud. just from that perspective, mr. speaker, it is alarming. but the beautiful thing is, here in america, we are blessed to live in a nation where our system of government does not work without involvement from the people. our whole system is reliant on the people of this great country to step up to the plate and engage it. that is the concept behind those powerful words, ``we, the people.'' this is our country. it is our turf. it is we, the people. so, we have a system of government that does not work unless we, the people, get involved in one capacity or another, whether it is voting or whether it is running for office or a million other things to be done in between. that is the way our system works. mr. speaker, i want to just emphasize the importance that we have to maintain those principles that allow all of us, regardless of religious beliefs, regardless of those who have no religious beliefs, but also remembering those who do have religious beliefs, that this is a country where the first amendment protects all of us. this is a country where the first amendment defense act applies to all of us. mr. speaker, i want to close with a quote. right out these doors is statuary hall. sometime back late one evening, i had some spare moments, and i came back over here to the capitol and was walking alone. i was virtually all by myself here in these great halls. i went into statuary hall, and i started reading and going to one statue after another. i went around reading about those individuals, and i came to one, james garfield. mr. speaker, many people don't know much about garfield these days, but he is the only minister to ever be elected president of the united states of america. i stood before that statue and i looked at him and, mr. speaker, i was [[page h4569]] reminded of a statement. i actually have come to be a great admirer of garfield. it seems to me that everything i have read from him has been powerful. he seemed to have a keen awareness and understanding of the role of what i am talking about today: the role of religion and morality in american society and culture and our entire system of government. garfield made this statement, mr. speaker, and i believe it is more applicable today than it has been in any day in which we have lived. here is what he said: ``now more than ever before, the people are responsible for the character of their congress. if that body be ignorant, reckless and corrupt, it is because the people tolerate ignorance, recklessness and corruption. if it be intelligent, brave and pure, it is because the people demand these qualities to represent them in the national legislature.'' then, he said this, mr. speaker: ``if the next centennial does not find us a great nation . . . it will be because those who represent the enterprise, the culture, and the morality of the nation do not aid in controlling the political forces.'' what a powerful statement. mr. speaker, being reminded of that statement, i would ask us today: how can we, the people be involved, be it in the enterprise, the culture, or the morality of the nation? how can we, as garfield said, be involved in controlling the political forces if we do not have the first amendment protections to do so? how can we be engaged if we continue to chip away at the right of people to believe what they believe and to exercise those beliefs within the public square without fear of intimidation or punishment? mr. speaker, i believe now more than ever is the time for us not to chip away at our first amendment rights, but to defend them and protect them and ensure that those rights are maintained for all americans now and for the next generation and for as long as this nation exist. mr. speaker, as the first amendment defense act comes before this body in the weeks to come, i hope and pray that we will stand behind it. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",19381

CREC-2016-07-08-pt1-PgH4569,CREC-2016-07-08,114,TRAGEDY IN AMERICA,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [House] [Pages H4569-H4571] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRAGEDY IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, might I ask how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 32 minutes remaining. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much my friend, Mr. Hice, who preceded me. It is a very sad day around the country. So much in the way of sympathy and prayers for the victims' families in Dallas are greatly appreciated. As someone who grew up looking forward to visits to the big city of Dallas, it is deeply troubling to see what has happened there. The Dallas police chief said that the suspect said he wanted to kill White people, especially White police officers. I was listening in the cloakroom to a press conference going on now with some of our African American Members of Congress defending Black Lives Matter and discussing the unfairness in America for African Americans in this country. I don't know the races of the officers that were shot. Apparently, the suspect said he wanted to shoot and kill White officers, but I know there are a lot of officers in Dallas of a lot of different races. I had the opportunity, if you want to call it an opportunity, of trying a murder case for 10 weeks in Dallas. I worked with some incredible Dallas police officers. Because of my background, I continue to have great respect for law enforcement officers. There was something that we had seen since the protest days of the sixties and seventies: calling police officers pigs and calling them all kinds of names. People--terrorists from those days that have now grown up and even teaching college--wanted to kill pigs, wanted to kill police officers back then. Back then it wasn't a race issue; it was just killing what they called pigs. Having served 4 years in the Army after Vietnam, we weren't ever in combat in my 4 years, but we knew what it was to be spit at, to be ridiculed, and at times to be told not to wear your uniform off post because people hate you so much. So I have some empathy for what officers have gone through. The evil and the hatred that brought about 9/11, killing thousands of precious lives, taking so many innocent lives here, had a result that I didn't expect: it brought America together. September 12, there on our town square in Tyler, Texas, people of all walks, age, race, gender--it didn't matter--came together. We sang together, we prayed together, and even all held hands together. {time} 1315 As I have said before, the thing I loved about that day was there was no--there were no hyphenated Americans on September 12 of 2001. We were Americans, without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, gender, age. None of that mattered. We were Americans. We had been attacked, and we were wanting to stand together. In all our sympathy for those who died on 9/11, the day after, it felt good to be together. For about 3 months our churches were filled and people were asking God to bless America again, and it felt good to be together as Americans. Nobody from organizations like Freedom from Religion dared show their face that day because people across America were begging God for His protection, for His blessings, as He has through most of our Nation's history. There is an article that has already come out today from the Federalist publication. It says: ``Five Takeaways From the Dallas Police Chief's Press Conference. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings and Dallas Police Chief David Brown held a press conference Friday morning in the wake of the sniper shooting during a Black Lives Matter protest in downtown Dallas that killed at least five officers and injured seven more and two civilians.'' The five takeaways, they say, are, number 1: ``Police Killed a Suspect With a Robot Carrying a Bomb.'' Number 2: ``Gunman Said he Wanted to `Kill White People, White Officers.' '' Number 3: ``Brown and Rawlings Were Unclear About Number of Suspect/s and their Descriptions.'' Number 4: ``Brown said Police Don't Feel Support Most Days, but Need It Now.'' Number 5: ``Brown and Rawlings Asked for Prayer.'' I appreciate my fellow Members of Congress feeling the need to have a press conference today and, again, to support the movement of Black Lives Matter and the injustices that have happened at the hands of police officers. As I have said many times during my adult life, including especially during my days as a District Judge handling felony cases where humans are involved, there will be mistakes and wrongdoing. And no matter what profession, there will be people who do wrong. But I have always taken solace in the fact--what I believe is the fact--that amongst law enforcement, those who would do wrong or who may be prejudiced in their motivation, the numbers are so much fewer percentagewise than in the general population. That is why over the last 7\1/2\ years it has grieved me greatly to see our President rebuff the opportunity to bring us together as a nation anytime an incident involved a police officer, his knee-jerk reactions repeatedly, whether it was saying that the police acted stupidly or jumping onto the bandwagon against police, when it turned out the police were in the right. There have been instances where they were not, and there are some on video where it clearly appears they did terribly wrong and reacted terribly wrong. And when that happens, perpetrators, wrongdoers are to be punished without regard to race, creed, color, gender, national origin. That doesn't matter. It seems, as long as we have groups like Black Lives Matter, who will just become unnerved and inflamed when a Democratic candidate for President says all lives matter and chastise him for saying all lives matter, to the point that he has to withdraw his belief that all lives matter and go back to saying, [[Page H4570]] you're right, you're right, it's just Black lives matter. That is nowhere near approaching the dream that Martin Luther King, Jr., had just about 2\1/2\ miles down the Mall here in front of the Lincoln Memorial. So we had people, after 9/11, return to loving and appreciating and an outpouring of support for first responders, law enforcement, because they saw that, when push came to shove, the huge majority of law officers put their own life at risk for the benefit of others without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin, gender, age. They don't care. Their job is to serve and protect, and they do an amazing job. I just keep going back to the statement of the police chief, that police don't feel support most days, but they need it now. But when elected officials contribute to stoking the flame of hatred and animosity toward our law enforcement, then people that don't have the reasoning ability that most of our elected officials have get stoked. They get inflamed. And we don't need anybody coming out and blaming guns before that person even knows what kind of guns were used. I know we have friends that keep saying, if you are on the no-fly list, which means if you are on the list that has a great deal of arbitrariness to it, to the point that this administration will not even tell Congress how they decide who goes on the no-fly list, and even though they won't tell us how to get off the no-fly list if you are arbitrarily and mistakenly put on it, as Ted Kennedy and so many others have been, that is a formula for disaster for totalitarianism. We don't need an arbitrary list that is concocted in secret with the secret way of getting off that we are not aware of. That is not the way you go about trying to take away people's civil rights to keep and bear arms. After seeing the disaster in Dallas, there are a number of things I knew. One is that the people in Texas--most of them, except for the agitators, so many that have come in from outside, but most of them-- will respond and show their love and support for our law officers because we love law abiding in Texas. I hope and pray, Mr. Speaker, that we can stop the divisiveness. There is nothing wrong with arguing. There is nothing wrong with debate. That is how we got our Constitution--a lot of yelling and fussing, bickering, came together. There is nothing wrong with disagreeing. Until one person in this Congress or in the White House has 100 percent lock on God's truth all the time, then we need to argue, we need to debate. I would submit we need to be prayerful in how we approach what we should do, but it is good to debate. I grew up in a family of four kids. We argued, fussed, bickered, but we came together as a family, and still do. In times of hurting, we still come together, and that is what we need to do as a nation. I look forward to the day when there is no group that includes a race color, a skin color, in its name. I look forward to that day when it just doesn't matter. And it seems clear to me that as long as we keep calling out distinctions between ourselves with matters of race, creed, color, national origin, gender, age, that there will continue to be bias and prejudice further engendered. I have seen video, including those recently, where I was horrified to see what happened. I didn't care what color the officer was. I didn't care what color the victim's skin color was. I was horrified that a victim would be treated as victims have been recently. I look forward to the day when the percentage of people committing crimes, according to race, have no need of being kept because it doesn't matter. We care about how you act, not how you look. But as long as those numbers keep being kept, they need to all be looked at. We need to get to the bottom of not just why so many African Americans are being killed in America--as we see from the numbers the FBI puts out, the huge majority are from other--the lives are taken by other African Americans. And I look forward to my friends getting upset about that someday, about the numbers of deaths in cities controlled by African Americans that have made it hard to possess guns unless you are a criminal. I have people that want to constantly point to our justice system and say: See how unfair it is? Well, in my court--I was asked just last week: Did you have any capital murder cases? Have you ever had cases where you had to look someone in the eye and pronounce the death sentence? I had two. I tried three capital cases. They take a long time to try because--particularly with the jury selection. Someone--the same person said skeptically: And let me guess; both of those were Black. I look forward to the day when people don't skeptically assume that everything is about race. As it just so happens, the two of the three capital murder cases where I had to sentence someone to death, they were White defendants. The one case where the defendant did not get the death penalty, though he was convicted of murder, happened to be African American. I had an issue raised by a defense attorney on a death penalty case out of another court, but in our county, and they were wanting--and I was subpoenaed as a witness to testify about the disproportionate number of African Americans who had not been allowed to be grand jury foremen. {time} 1330 When they actually got the list of my grand jury--the judge doesn't pick the grand juries. Those are selected by grand jury commissioners of different races, creeds, colors, and national origin. As long as they are American citizens, they picked the grand juries, and then the only thing the judge picks in Texas is the foreman. After they got the list of grand juries that I have presided over and they saw that there was disproportionately more African Americans who had been foremen of the grand juries, they told me they didn't want me as a witness because clearly I was not going to help their case. But when I selected a foreman of a grand jury, I didn't care what their color was. I knew we needed good, sound leadership. Every person I ever selected as a foreman of a grand jury I knew was a caring, intelligent, and upstanding leader in our community. I didn't care what their color was. Jesus said: ``Greater love has no one than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.'' He certainly would know; He did exactly that. I love that being the first thing on the plaque for Father Damien, one of the two statues that we have in the Capitol from Hawaii. Abraham Lincoln on September 5, 1864, said: ``In regard to this Great Book''--and he capitalized ``Great'' and ``Book,'' talking about the Bible--``I have but to say, I believe the Bible is the best gift God has given to man. All the good Saviour''--and I know that term offends so many, but this was Abraham Lincoln's own words. ``All the good Savior gave to the world was communicated through this Book,'' the Bible. ``But for this Book we could not know right from wrong. All things most desirable for man's welfare, here and hereafter, are to be found portrayed in it.'' Mr. Speaker, I want to finish with a verse and a personal incident. Since Abraham Lincoln and most all of our Presidents have highly commended the use of the Bible as getting this Nation on track when we become dislodged, disoriented, and divisive, we go to Matthew 22:35: And one of them who was a lawyer--being a lawyer, you figure, leave it to lawyers to try to stir up trouble. One of them who was a lawyer tested Him by asking Him: ``Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?'' Jesus said to him: ``You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'' This is the first and greatest commandment. And a second is like it: ``You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'' On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. Some people wonder about it. What does He mean, on those two commands, love God, love each other, hang all the law and the prophets? What does He mean, all the law and the prophets hang on those two commands? If you were to outline the Ten Commandments that God gave us and that most of our leaders in history have believed came from God, himself-- and that is why Moses up here, directly above me, facing me, is the only full [[Page H4571]] face of the greatest lawgivers in the history of the world. It is because, at one time, all of the Supreme Court thought those Ten Commandments were great commandments. Now, probably at least four would say that maybe five or six were okay. But for most of our history, they have felt those ten were great commandments. If you do an outline or you categorize all of those Ten Commandments, they all fit neatly under two categories: one, love God; and number two, love each other. That came home very clearly to me years ago when my mother had a brain tumor. We knew it would eventually take her. The doctors had made that clear. They made clear that there was nothing more that could be done. Mother had said that she wasn't interested in seeing more doctors because they had said the same thing. Since she was my lifelong English teacher--but especially my eighth grade English teacher--and she loved poetry, I threw one of her poems back at her from Dylan Thomas: ``Rage, rage against the dying of the light . . . Do not go gentle into that good night.'' Mother wrote back. She was thrilled that I paid attention. But she quoted from another poem called ``Thanatopsis'' that talked about living with such faith that, at the end of life, you can lie down on the couch wrapped in covers around you. Well, the doctors said: We don't think she has got all that much longer to live. They weren't quite accurate; but she had been reduced, this incredibly brilliant woman, to a wheelchair. It took her a long time to say things. This incredibly brilliant woman put herself through Baylor, 2\1/2\ years. Her parents lived right there by the campus, so she could work full-time and go to school. I didn't know until after she passed she was a member of a big honor society there. But anyway, she loved our kids, and she loved our spouses. One weekend we decided, let's just have the four immediate children go back to Mount Pleasant and spend the weekend with Mom, and we did. That Saturday morning, we sat around the breakfast table for hours like we did years before. We told stories, we laughed, and we made good-natured fun of each other. We would disagree, and then we would come back around and kid and love each other. We went on for 3 or 4 hours. Mother didn't say anything. But finally Mother said, ``This,'' and we all got quiet. We would stay there all night if it took it to hear what Mother had to say. And she got out, ``is my favorite thing.'' That is all she had to say. When I left later that weekend to drive back to Tyler, it became clear that, if you were a heavenly parent, wouldn't you want your children loving you and loving each other? And all the law hang on those two: love your parent; love each other. It takes care of things. Then what Jesus said made perfect sense. I look forward to the day when Martin Luther King, Jr.'s dream will be fulfilled and nobody will care about Black lives matter and White lives matter. Nobody will care what color people are, and we will come together again without any hyphenation as Americans. But as long as we have leaders who continue to pick at a scab and refuse to let it heal, then our law officers are in danger, our country is in danger, and this little experiment with a democratic Republic is in severe jeopardy. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [House] [Pages H4569-H4571] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRAGEDY IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk).

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much my friend, Mr. Hice, who preceded me. It is a very sad day around the country. So much in the way of sympathy and prayers for the victims' families in Dallas are greatly appreciated. As someone who grew up looking forward to visits to the big city of Dallas, it is deeply troubling to see what has happened there. The Dallas police chief said that the suspect said he wanted to kill White people, especially White police officers. I was listening in the cloakroom to a press conference going on now with some of our African American Members of Congress defending Black Lives Matter and discussing the unfairness in America for African Americans in this country. I don't know the races of the officers that were shot. Apparently, the suspect said he wanted to shoot and kill White officers, but I know there are a lot of officers in Dallas of a lot of different races. I had the opportunity, if you want to call it an opportunity, of trying a murder case for 10 weeks in Dallas. I worked with some incredible Dallas police officers. Because of my background, I continue to have great respect for law enforcement officers. There was something that we had seen since the protest days of the sixties and seventies: calling police officers pigs and calling them all kinds of names. People--terrorists from those days that have now grown up and even teaching college--wanted to kill pigs, wanted to kill police officers back then. Back then it wasn't a race issue; it was just killing what they called pigs. Having served 4 years in the Army after Vietnam, we weren't ever in combat in my 4 years, but we knew what it was to be spit at, to be ridiculed, and at times to be told not to wear your uniform off post because people hate you so much. So I have some empathy for what officers have gone through. The evil and the hatred that brought about 9/11, killing thousands of precious lives, taking so many innocent lives here, had a result that I didn't expect: it brought America together. September 12, there on our town square in Tyler, Texas, people of all walks, age, race, gender--it didn't matter--came together. We sang together, we prayed together, and even all held hands together. {time} 1315 As I have said before, the thing I loved about that day was there was no--there were no hyphenated Americans on September 12 of 2001. We were Americans, without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, gender, age. None of that mattered. We were Americans. We had been attacked, and we were wanting to stand together. In all our sympathy for those who died on 9/11, the day after, it felt good to be together. For about 3 months our churches were filled and people were asking God to bless America again, and it felt good to be together as Americans. Nobody from organizations like Freedom from Religion dared show their face that day because people across America were begging God for His protection, for His blessings, as He has through most of our Nation's history. There is an article that has already come out today from the Federalist publication. It says: ``Five Takeaways From the Dallas Police Chief's Press Conference. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings and Dallas Police Chief David Brown held a press conference Friday morning in the wake of the sniper shooting during a Black Lives Matter protest in downtown Dallas that killed at least five officers and injured seven more and two civilians.'' The five takeaways, they say, are, number 1: ``Police Killed a Suspect With a Robot Carrying a Bomb.'' Number 2: ``Gunman Said he Wanted to `Kill White People, White Officers.' '' Number 3: ``Brown and Rawlings Were Unclear About Number of Suspect/s and their Descriptions.'' Number 4: ``Brown said Police Don't Feel Support Most Days, but Need It Now.'' Number 5: ``Brown and Rawlings Asked for Prayer.'' I appreciate my fellow Members of Congress feeling the need to have a press conference today and, again, to support the movement of Black Lives Matter and the injustices that have happened at the hands of police officers. As I have said many times during my adult life, including especially during my days as a District Judge handling felony cases where humans are involved, there will be mistakes and wrongdoing. And no matter what profession, there will be people who do wrong. But I have always taken solace in the fact--what I believe is the fact--that amongst law enforcement, those who would do wrong or who may be prejudiced in their motivation, the numbers are so much fewer percentagewise than in the general population. That is why over the last 7\1/2\ years it has grieved me greatly to see our President rebuff the opportunity to bring us together as a nation anytime an incident involved a police officer, his knee-jerk reactions repeatedly, whether it was saying that the police acted stupidly or jumping onto the bandwagon against police, when it turned out the police were in the right. There have been instances where they were not, and there are some on video where it clearly appears they did terribly wrong and reacted terribly wrong. And when that happens, perpetrators, wrongdoers are to be punished without regard to race, creed, color, gender, national origin. That doesn't matter. It seems, as long as we have groups like Black Lives Matter, who will just become unnerved and inflamed when a Democratic candidate for President says all lives matter and chastise him for saying all lives matter, to the point that he has to withdraw his belief that all lives matter and go back to saying, [[Page H4570]] you're right, you're right, it's just Black lives matter. That is nowhere near approaching the dream that Martin Luther King, Jr., had just about 2\1/2\ miles down the Mall here in front of the Lincoln Memorial. So we had people, after 9/11, return to loving and appreciating and an outpouring of support for first responders, law enforcement, because they saw that, when push came to shove, the huge majority of law officers put their own life at risk for the benefit of others without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin, gender, age. They don't care. Their job is to serve and protect, and they do an amazing job. I just keep going back to the statement of the police chief, that police don't feel support most days, but they need it now. But when elected officials contribute to stoking the flame of hatred and animosity toward our law enforcement, then people that don't have the reasoning ability that most of our elected officials have get stoked. They get inflamed. And we don't need anybody coming out and blaming guns before that person even knows what kind of guns were used. I know we have friends that keep saying, if you are on the no-fly list, which means if you are on the list that has a great deal of arbitrariness to it, to the point that this administration will not even tell Congress how they decide who goes on the no-fly list, and even though they won't tell us how to get off the no-fly list if you are arbitrarily and mistakenly put on it, as Ted Kennedy and so many others have been, that is a formula for disaster for totalitarianism. We don't need an arbitrary list that is concocted in secret with the secret way of getting off that we are not aware of. That is not the way you go about trying to take away people's civil rights to keep and bear arms. After seeing the disaster in Dallas, there are a number of things I knew. One is that the people in Texas--most of them, except for the agitators, so many that have come in from outside, but most of them-- will respond and show their love and support for our law officers because we love law abiding in Texas. I hope and pray, Mr. Speaker, that we can stop the divisiveness. There is nothing wrong with arguing. There is nothing wrong with debate. That is how we got our Constitution--a lot of yelling and fussing, bickering, came together. There is nothing wrong with disagreeing. Until one person in this Congress or in the White House has 100 percent lock on God's truth all the time, then we need to argue, we need to debate. I would submit we need to be prayerful in how we approach what we should do, but it is good to debate. I grew up in a family of four kids. We argued, fussed, bickered, but we came together as a family, and still do. In times of hurting, we still come together, and that is what we need to do as a nation. I look forward to the day when there is no group that includes a race color, a skin color, in its name. I look forward to that day when it just doesn't matter. And it seems clear to me that as long as we keep calling out distinctions between ourselves with matters of race, creed, color, national origin, gender, age, that there will continue to be bias and prejudice further engendered. I have seen video, including those recently, where I was horrified to see what happened. I didn't care what color the officer was. I didn't care what color the victim's skin color was. I was horrified that a victim would be treated as victims have been recently. I look forward to the day when the percentage of people committing crimes, according to race, have no need of being kept because it doesn't matter. We care about how you act, not how you look. But as long as those numbers keep being kept, they need to all be looked at. We need to get to the bottom of not just why so many African Americans are being killed in America--as we see from the numbers the FBI puts out, the huge majority are from other--the lives are taken by other African Americans. And I look forward to my friends getting upset about that someday, about the numbers of deaths in cities controlled by African Americans that have made it hard to possess guns unless you are a criminal. I have people that want to constantly point to our justice system and say: See how unfair it is? Well, in my court--I was asked just last week: Did you have any capital murder cases? Have you ever had cases where you had to look someone in the eye and pronounce the death sentence? I had two. I tried three capital cases. They take a long time to try because--particularly with the jury selection. Someone--the same person said skeptically: And let me guess; both of those were Black. I look forward to the day when people don't skeptically assume that everything is about race. As it just so happens, the two of the three capital murder cases where I had to sentence someone to death, they were White defendants. The one case where the defendant did not get the death penalty, though he was convicted of murder, happened to be African American. I had an issue raised by a defense attorney on a death penalty case out of another court, but in our county, and they were wanting--and I was subpoenaed as a witness to testify about the disproportionate number of African Americans who had not been allowed to be grand jury foremen. {time} 1330 When they actually got the list of my grand jury--the judge doesn't pick the grand juries. Those are selected by grand jury commissioners of different races, creeds, colors, and national origin. As long as they are American citizens, they picked the grand juries, and then the only thing the judge picks in Texas is the foreman. After they got the list of grand juries that I have presided over and they saw that there was disproportionately more African Americans who had been foremen of the grand juries, they told me they didn't want me as a witness because clearly I was not going to help their case. But when I selected a foreman of a grand jury, I didn't care what their color was. I knew we needed good, sound leadership. Every person I ever selected as a foreman of a grand jury I knew was a caring, intelligent, and upstanding leader in our community. I didn't care what their color was. Jesus said: ``Greater love has no one than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.'' He certainly would know; He did exactly that. I love that being the first thing on the plaque for Father Damien, one of the two statues that we have in the Capitol from Hawaii. Abraham Lincoln on September 5, 1864, said: ``In regard to this Great Book''--and he capitalized ``Great'' and ``Book,'' talking about the Bible--``I have but to say, I believe the Bible is the best gift God has given to man. All the good Saviour''--and I know that term offends so many, but this was Abraham Lincoln's own words. ``All the good Savior gave to the world was communicated through this Book,'' the Bible. ``But for this Book we could not know right from wrong. All things most desirable for man's welfare, here and hereafter, are to be found portrayed in it.'' Mr. Speaker, I want to finish with a verse and a personal incident. Since Abraham Lincoln and most all of our Presidents have highly commended the use of the Bible as getting this Nation on track when we become dislodged, disoriented, and divisive, we go to Matthew 22:35: And one of them who was a lawyer--being a lawyer, you figure, leave it to lawyers to try to stir up trouble. One of them who was a lawyer tested Him by asking Him: ``Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?'' Jesus said to him: ``You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'' This is the first and greatest commandment. And a second is like it: ``You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'' On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. Some people wonder about it. What does He mean, on those two commands, love God, love each other, hang all the law and the prophets? What does He mean, all the law and the prophets hang on those two commands? If you were to outline the Ten Commandments that God gave us and that most of our leaders in history have believed came from God, himself-- and that is why Moses up here, directly above me, facing me, is the only full [[Page H4571]] face of the greatest lawgivers in the history of the world. It is because, at one time, all of the Supreme Court thought those Ten Commandments were great commandments. Now, probably at least four would say that maybe five or six were okay. But for most of our history, they have felt those ten were great commandments. If you do an outline or you categorize all of those Ten Commandments, they all fit neatly under two categories: one, love God; and number two, love each other. That came home very clearly to me years ago when my mother had a brain tumor. We knew it would eventually take her. The doctors had made that clear. They made clear that there was nothing more that could be done. Mother had said that she wasn't interested in seeing more doctors because they had said the same thing. Since she was my lifelong English teacher--but especially my eighth grade English teacher--and she loved poetry, I threw one of her poems back at her from Dylan Thomas: ``Rage, rage against the dying of the light . . . Do not go gentle into that good night.'' Mother wrote back. She was thrilled that I paid attention. But she quoted from another poem called ``Thanatopsis'' that talked about living with such faith that, at the end of life, you can lie down on the couch wrapped in covers around you. Well, the doctors said: We don't think she has got all that much longer to live. They weren't quite accurate; but she had been reduced, this incredibly brilliant woman, to a wheelchair. It took her a long time to say things. This incredibly brilliant woman put herself through Baylor, 2\1/2\ years. Her parents lived right there by the campus, so she could work full-time and go to school. I didn't know until after she passed she was a member of a big honor society there. But anyway, she loved our kids, and she loved our spouses. One weekend we decided, let's just have the four immediate children go back to Mount Pleasant and spend the weekend with Mom, and we did. That Saturday morning, we sat around the breakfast table for hours like we did years before. We told stories, we laughed, and we made good-natured fun of each other. We would disagree, and then we would come back around and kid and love each other. We went on for 3 or 4 hours. Mother didn't say anything. But finally Mother said, ``This,'' and we all got quiet. We would stay there all night if it took it to hear what Mother had to say. And she got out, ``is my favorite thing.'' That is all she had to say. When I left later that weekend to drive back to Tyler, it became clear that, if you were a heavenly parent, wouldn't you want your children loving you and loving each other? And all the law hang on those two: love your parent; love each other. It takes care of things. Then what Jesus said made perfect sense. I look forward to the day when Martin Luther King, Jr.'s dream will be fulfilled and nobody will care about Black lives matter and White lives matter. Nobody will care what color people are, and we will come together again without any hyphenation as Americans. But as long as we have leaders who continue to pick at a scab and refuse to let it heal, then our law officers are in danger, our country is in danger, and this little experiment with a democratic Republic is in severe jeopardy. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [House] [Pages H4569-H4571] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRAGEDY IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk).

I look forward to the day when Martin Luther King, Jr.'s dream will be fulfilled and nobody will care about Black lives matter and White lives matter. Nobody will care what color people are, and we will come together again without any hyphenation as Americans. But as long as we have leaders who continue to pick at a scab and refuse to let it heal, then our law officers are in danger, our country is in danger, and this little experiment with a democratic Republic is in severe jeopardy. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_251.csv,17812,17812,17878,"[congressional record volume 162, number 110 (friday, july 8, 2016)] [house] [pages h4569-h4571] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] tragedy in america the speaker pro tempore (mr. loudermilk). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, might i ask how much time is remaining? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman has 32 minutes remaining. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, i appreciate very much my friend, mr. hice, who preceded me. it is a very sad day around the country. so much in the way of sympathy and prayers for the victims' families in dallas are greatly appreciated. as someone who grew up looking forward to visits to the big city of dallas, it is deeply troubling to see what has happened there. the dallas police chief said that the suspect said he wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers. i was listening in the cloakroom to a press conference going on now with some of our african american members of congress defending black lives matter and discussing the unfairness in america for african americans in this country. i don't know the races of the officers that were shot. apparently, the suspect said he wanted to shoot and kill white officers, but i know there are a lot of officers in dallas of a lot of different races. i had the opportunity, if you want to call it an opportunity, of trying a murder case for 10 weeks in dallas. i worked with some incredible dallas police officers. because of my background, i continue to have great respect for law enforcement officers. there was something that we had seen since the protest days of the sixties and seventies: calling police officers pigs and calling them all kinds of names. people--terrorists from those days that have now grown up and even teaching college--wanted to kill pigs, wanted to kill police officers back then. back then it wasn't a race issue; it was just killing what they called pigs. having served 4 years in the army after vietnam, we weren't ever in combat in my 4 years, but we knew what it was to be spit at, to be ridiculed, and at times to be told not to wear your uniform off post because people hate you so much. so i have some empathy for what officers have gone through. the evil and the hatred that brought about 9/11, killing thousands of precious lives, taking so many innocent lives here, had a result that i didn't expect: it brought america together. september 12, there on our town square in tyler, texas, people of all walks, age, race, gender--it didn't matter--came together. we sang together, we prayed together, and even all held hands together. {time} 1315 as i have said before, the thing i loved about that day was there was no--there were no hyphenated americans on september 12 of 2001. we were americans, without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, gender, age. none of that mattered. we were americans. we had been attacked, and we were wanting to stand together. in all our sympathy for those who died on 9/11, the day after, it felt good to be together. for about 3 months our churches were filled and people were asking god to bless america again, and it felt good to be together as americans. nobody from organizations like freedom from religion dared show their face that day because people across america were begging god for his protection, for his blessings, as he has through most of our nation's history. there is an article that has already come out today from the federalist publication. it says: ``five takeaways from the dallas police chief's press conference. dallas mayor mike rawlings and dallas police chief david brown held a press conference friday morning in the wake of the sniper shooting during a black lives matter protest in downtown dallas that killed at least five officers and injured seven more and two civilians.'' the five takeaways, they say, are, number 1: ``police killed a suspect with a robot carrying a bomb.'' number 2: ``gunman said he wanted to `kill white people, white officers.' '' number 3: ``brown and rawlings were unclear about number of suspect/s and their descriptions.'' number 4: ``brown said police don't feel support most days, but need it now.'' number 5: ``brown and rawlings asked for prayer.'' i appreciate my fellow members of congress feeling the need to have a press conference today and, again, to support the movement of black lives matter and the injustices that have happened at the hands of police officers. as i have said many times during my adult life, including especially during my days as a district judge handling felony cases where humans are involved, there will be mistakes and wrongdoing. and no matter what profession, there will be people who do wrong. but i have always taken solace in the fact--what i believe is the fact--that amongst law enforcement, those who would do wrong or who may be prejudiced in their motivation, the numbers are so much fewer percentagewise than in the general population. that is why over the last 7\1/2\ years it has grieved me greatly to see our president rebuff the opportunity to bring us together as a nation anytime an incident involved a police officer, his knee-jerk reactions repeatedly, whether it was saying that the police acted stupidly or jumping onto the bandwagon against police, when it turned out the police were in the right. there have been instances where they were not, and there are some on video where it clearly appears they did terribly wrong and reacted terribly wrong. and when that happens, perpetrators, wrongdoers are to be punished without regard to race, creed, color, gender, national origin. that doesn't matter. it seems, as long as we have groups like black lives matter, who will just become unnerved and inflamed when a democratic candidate for president says all lives matter and chastise him for saying all lives matter, to the point that he has to withdraw his belief that all lives matter and go back to saying, [[page h4570]] you're right, you're right, it's just black lives matter. that is nowhere near approaching the dream that martin luther king, jr., had just about 2\1/2\ miles down the mall here in front of the lincoln memorial. so we had people, after 9/11, return to loving and appreciating and an outpouring of support for first responders, law enforcement, because they saw that, when push came to shove, the huge majority of law officers put their own life at risk for the benefit of others without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin, gender, age. they don't care. their job is to serve and protect, and they do an amazing job. i just keep going back to the statement of the police chief, that police don't feel support most days, but they need it now. but when elected officials contribute to stoking the flame of hatred and animosity toward our law enforcement, then people that don't have the reasoning ability that most of our elected officials have get stoked. they get inflamed. and we don't need anybody coming out and blaming guns before that person even knows what kind of guns were used. i know we have friends that keep saying, if you are on the no-fly list, which means if you are on the list that has a great deal of arbitrariness to it, to the point that this administration will not even tell congress how they decide who goes on the no-fly list, and even though they won't tell us how to get off the no-fly list if you are arbitrarily and mistakenly put on it, as ted kennedy and so many others have been, that is a formula for disaster for totalitarianism. we don't need an arbitrary list that is concocted in secret with the secret way of getting off that we are not aware of. that is not the way you go about trying to take away people's civil rights to keep and bear arms. after seeing the disaster in dallas, there are a number of things i knew. one is that the people in texas--most of them, except for the agitators, so many that have come in from outside, but most of them-- will respond and show their love and support for our law officers because we love law abiding in texas. i hope and pray, mr. speaker, that we can stop the divisiveness. there is nothing wrong with arguing. there is nothing wrong with debate. that is how we got our constitution--a lot of yelling and fussing, bickering, came together. there is nothing wrong with disagreeing. until one person in this congress or in the white house has 100 percent lock on god's truth all the time, then we need to argue, we need to debate. i would submit we need to be prayerful in how we approach what we should do, but it is good to debate. i grew up in a family of four kids. we argued, fussed, bickered, but we came together as a family, and still do. in times of hurting, we still come together, and that is what we need to do as a nation. i look forward to the day when there is no group that includes a race color, a skin color, in its name. i look forward to that day when it just doesn't matter. and it seems clear to me that as long as we keep calling out distinctions between ourselves with matters of race, creed, color, national origin, gender, age, that there will continue to be bias and prejudice further engendered. i have seen video, including those recently, where i was horrified to see what happened. i didn't care what color the officer was. i didn't care what color the victim's skin color was. i was horrified that a victim would be treated as victims have been recently. i look forward to the day when the percentage of people committing crimes, according to race, have no need of being kept because it doesn't matter. we care about how you act, not how you look. but as long as those numbers keep being kept, they need to all be looked at. we need to get to the bottom of not just why so many african americans are being killed in america--as we see from the numbers the fbi puts out, the huge majority are from other--the lives are taken by other african americans. and i look forward to my friends getting upset about that someday, about the numbers of deaths in cities controlled by african americans that have made it hard to possess guns unless you are a criminal. i have people that want to constantly point to our justice system and say: see how unfair it is? well, in my court--i was asked just last week: did you have any capital murder cases? have you ever had cases where you had to look someone in the eye and pronounce the death sentence? i had two. i tried three capital cases. they take a long time to try because--particularly with the jury selection. someone--the same person said skeptically: and let me guess; both of those were black. i look forward to the day when people don't skeptically assume that everything is about race. as it just so happens, the two of the three capital murder cases where i had to sentence someone to death, they were white defendants. the one case where the defendant did not get the death penalty, though he was convicted of murder, happened to be african american. i had an issue raised by a defense attorney on a death penalty case out of another court, but in our county, and they were wanting--and i was subpoenaed as a witness to testify about the disproportionate number of african americans who had not been allowed to be grand jury foremen. {time} 1330 when they actually got the list of my grand jury--the judge doesn't pick the grand juries. those are selected by grand jury commissioners of different races, creeds, colors, and national origin. as long as they are american citizens, they picked the grand juries, and then the only thing the judge picks in texas is the foreman. after they got the list of grand juries that i have presided over and they saw that there was disproportionately more african americans who had been foremen of the grand juries, they told me they didn't want me as a witness because clearly i was not going to help their case. but when i selected a foreman of a grand jury, i didn't care what their color was. i knew we needed good, sound leadership. every person i ever selected as a foreman of a grand jury i knew was a caring, intelligent, and upstanding leader in our community. i didn't care what their color was. jesus said: ``greater love has no one than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.'' he certainly would know; he did exactly that. i love that being the first thing on the plaque for father damien, one of the two statues that we have in the capitol from hawaii. abraham lincoln on september 5, 1864, said: ``in regard to this great book''--and he capitalized ``great'' and ``book,'' talking about the bible--``i have but to say, i believe the bible is the best gift god has given to man. all the good saviour''--and i know that term offends so many, but this was abraham lincoln's own words. ``all the good savior gave to the world was communicated through this book,'' the bible. ``but for this book we could not know right from wrong. all things most desirable for man's welfare, here and hereafter, are to be found portrayed in it.'' mr. speaker, i want to finish with a verse and a personal incident. since abraham lincoln and most all of our presidents have highly commended the use of the bible as getting this nation on track when we become dislodged, disoriented, and divisive, we go to matthew 22:35: and one of them who was a lawyer--being a lawyer, you figure, leave it to lawyers to try to stir up trouble. one of them who was a lawyer tested him by asking him: ``teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?'' jesus said to him: ``you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'' this is the first and greatest commandment. and a second is like it: ``you shall love your neighbor as yourself.'' on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. some people wonder about it. what does he mean, on those two commands, love god, love each other, hang all the law and the prophets? what does he mean, all the law and the prophets hang on those two commands? if you were to outline the ten commandments that god gave us and that most of our leaders in history have believed came from god, himself-- and that is why moses up here, directly above me, facing me, is the only full [[page h4571]] face of the greatest lawgivers in the history of the world. it is because, at one time, all of the supreme court thought those ten commandments were great commandments. now, probably at least four would say that maybe five or six were okay. but for most of our history, they have felt those ten were great commandments. if you do an outline or you categorize all of those ten commandments, they all fit neatly under two categories: one, love god; and number two, love each other. that came home very clearly to me years ago when my mother had a brain tumor. we knew it would eventually take her. the doctors had made that clear. they made clear that there was nothing more that could be done. mother had said that she wasn't interested in seeing more doctors because they had said the same thing. since she was my lifelong english teacher--but especially my eighth grade english teacher--and she loved poetry, i threw one of her poems back at her from dylan thomas: ``rage, rage against the dying of the light . . . do not go gentle into that good night.'' mother wrote back. she was thrilled that i paid attention. but she quoted from another poem called ``thanatopsis'' that talked about living with such faith that, at the end of life, you can lie down on the couch wrapped in covers around you. well, the doctors said: we don't think she has got all that much longer to live. they weren't quite accurate; but she had been reduced, this incredibly brilliant woman, to a wheelchair. it took her a long time to say things. this incredibly brilliant woman put herself through baylor, 2\1/2\ years. her parents lived right there by the campus, so she could work full-time and go to school. i didn't know until after she passed she was a member of a big honor society there. but anyway, she loved our kids, and she loved our spouses. one weekend we decided, let's just have the four immediate children go back to mount pleasant and spend the weekend with mom, and we did. that saturday morning, we sat around the breakfast table for hours like we did years before. we told stories, we laughed, and we made good-natured fun of each other. we would disagree, and then we would come back around and kid and love each other. we went on for 3 or 4 hours. mother didn't say anything. but finally mother said, ``this,'' and we all got quiet. we would stay there all night if it took it to hear what mother had to say. and she got out, ``is my favorite thing.'' that is all she had to say. when i left later that weekend to drive back to tyler, it became clear that, if you were a heavenly parent, wouldn't you want your children loving you and loving each other? and all the law hang on those two: love your parent; love each other. it takes care of things. then what jesus said made perfect sense. i look forward to the day when martin luther king, jr.'s dream will be fulfilled and nobody will care about black lives matter and white lives matter. nobody will care what color people are, and we will come together again without any hyphenation as americans. but as long as we have leaders who continue to pick at a scab and refuse to let it heal, then our law officers are in danger, our country is in danger, and this little experiment with a democratic republic is in severe jeopardy. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",17812

BILL SHUSTER of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Coach Dave Bailey on his recent induction to the Bedford County, Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame. Coach Bailey took the struggling Tussey Mountain High School boys basketball program and turned it into a 42-year dominating force. With Bailey at the reigns, the Tussey Mountain Titans had an incredible winning record of 753-328. Over this period of time, his teams qualified for district playoffs 36 times, played in the district finals 21 times, and captured nine district titles. The Titans did not lose a game on their home court in Saxton for 55 consecutive games, stretching from 2006 through 2011, which rightfully resulted in their gymnasium being nicknamed ``The Terror Dome.'' Coach Bailey was without a doubt a staple in the Saxton community, as over 600 high school athletes have played for Tussey Mountain under his direction, and 17 of these players achieved 1,000 point careers. When Bailey was not coaching basketball, he also coached track and field and golf for Tussey Mountain, further impacting the lives of more student athletes. Retired now, he has a little more time to spend time with his wife and children. He enjoys golfing, all sports, and naturally giving advice to the boys basketball program. Today I am honored to recognize Dave Bailey for his exceptional coaching career and his many accomplishments. His impact on the community has been too great to put into words, and he has represented Central Pennsylvania and Bedford County with great distinction. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1065] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING COACH DAVE BAILEY'S LIFETIME OF ACHIEVEMENTS ______ HON.

The Titans did not lose a game on their home court in Saxton for 55 consecutive games, stretching from 2006 through 2011, which rightfully resulted in their gymnasium being nicknamed ``The Terror Dome.'' Coach Bailey was without a doubt a staple in the Saxton community, as over 600 high school athletes have played for Tussey Mountain under his direction, and 17 of these players achieved 1,000 point careers. When Bailey was not coaching basketball, he also coached track and field and golf for Tussey Mountain, further impacting the lives of more student athletes. Retired now, he has a little more time to spend time with his wife and children. He enjoys golfing, all sports, and naturally giving advice to the boys basketball program. Today I am honored to recognize Dave Bailey for his exceptional coaching career and his many accomplishments. His impact on the community has been too great to put into words, and he has represented Central Pennsylvania and Bedford County with great distinction. ____________________",package_114_251.csv,1912,1912,1978,"[congressional record volume 162, number 110 (friday, july 8, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1065] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] celebrating coach dave bailey's lifetime of achievements ______ hon. bill shuster of pennsylvania in the house of representatives friday, july 8, 2016 mr. shuster. mr. speaker, i rise today to congratulate coach dave bailey on his recent induction to the bedford county, pennsylvania sports hall of fame. coach bailey took the struggling tussey mountain high school boys basketball program and turned it into a 42-year dominating force. with bailey at the reigns, the tussey mountain titans had an incredible winning record of 753-328. over this period of time, his teams qualified for district playoffs 36 times, played in the district finals 21 times, and captured nine district titles. the titans did not lose a game on their home court in saxton for 55 consecutive games, stretching from 2006 through 2011, which rightfully resulted in their gymnasium being nicknamed ``the terror dome.'' coach bailey was without a doubt a staple in the saxton community, as over 600 high school athletes have played for tussey mountain under his direction, and 17 of these players achieved 1,000 point careers. when bailey was not coaching basketball, he also coached track and field and golf for tussey mountain, further impacting the lives of more student athletes. retired now, he has a little more time to spend time with his wife and children. he enjoys golfing, all sports, and naturally giving advice to the boys basketball program. today i am honored to recognize dave bailey for his exceptional coaching career and his many accomplishments. his impact on the community has been too great to put into words, and he has represented central pennsylvania and bedford county with great distinction. ____________________",1912

SAM FARR of california in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the families across the country that have been touched by gun violence. I am heartbroken, angry, and dismayed over this week's shootings in Baton Rouge, Falcon Heights, and Dallas. Unfortunately, these events are all too common in communities across the country. Every day, 91 Americans lose their lives to gun violence. The federal government can and must do more to make our communities safer. We should use California's gun safety laws as an example. California just enacted legislation to ban the possession of magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. California already bans most assault-style weapons. California has stricter background checks than most states. California mandates a cooling off period after a gun purchase. And, California requires a background check to buy bullets. Let's follow California's lead. Congress should pass ``No Fly, No Buy.'' Congress should vote on mandatory background checks. Congress should ban assault weapons. Let's have the courage to stand up to the powerful gun lobby. Two weeks ago, I was proud to join the historic sit-in to demand congressional action on bipartisan gun safety laws. The sit-in was widely supported by millions of law abiding Americans, including responsible gun owners, who want Congress to enact commonsense gun legislation. Instead, Speaker Ryan has pushed forward a watered-down bill that already failed in the Republican-led Senate. This is not a real attempt at preventing future gun violence. No more moments of silence. Instead I call for moments of action by this legislative body. For victims of gun violence and their families and for our children and grandchildren, let's do something that will make our communities safer. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1065] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE ______ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 5, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4539, the ``400 Years of African-American History Commission Act,'' which will develop and carry out activities that commemorate the arrival of Africans in English colonies in 1619 at Point Comfort, Virginia. Mr. Speaker, today it is difficult to imagine there once was a time in our country when African-Americans were owned, disrespected, and treated as less than second-class citizens for hundreds of years. However, since the 1960's we have witnessed social and economic revolutions that have transformed our country for the better and brought about the greatest reduction in economic and social inequality among Americans in history. H.R. 4539 will create programs that highlight the undeniable impact that slavery, de jure segregation, Jim Crow Laws, and the Black Codes had in creating and mandating systemic racism and inequality. The Commission will plan programs that acknowledge the impacts that marred the social, political, and economic progress of African- Americans in the United States. The Commission encourages the collaboration of organizations that honor the great contributions of African-American activists, leaders, writers, and artists. H.R. 4539 encourages the collaboration and participation of civic, economic, historical, educational, patriotic, artistic, and religious organizations to come together to celebrate anniversary activities. The contributions of African-Americans to our great nation is an essential part of our history and should be celebrated. Tribute must be paid to the trailblazers, pioneers, heroes, and leaders, the countless number of well-known and unsung heroes whose contributions have helped our nation become a more perfect union The African-American History Commission will help us honor those who have come before us, and pay forward to future generations by addressing what is the number one issue for all American families today: preserving the American promise of economic opportunity for all. To accomplish this, the Commission will assist non-profit organizations, localities, and states to further the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Africans in English colonies by allowing grant funding for the development of programs The Commission is also authorized to provide funding for research and academic and public policy organizations to publish and distribute information about the arrival of Africans in the United States and their contribution to this country. It took hard work, courage, patience, determination, and most of all, an unwavering faith that America could live up to the true meaning of its creed. Mr. Speaker, enacting H.R. 4539 and establishing the African-American History Commission will lay the foundation for the next generation of groundbreaking activists, leaders, scientists, writers and artists to continue contributing to the greatness of America. Social progress and justice does not always come easy or overnight but with commitment, determination, and perseverance, progress can be made and barriers can be broken. It is through our work in creating possibilities and programs for today and future generations that we best honor the accomplishments and legacy of our predecessors. Through the establishment of the 400 Years of African-American History Commission, that is made possible. I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 4539. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1065] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 400 YEARS OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY COMMISSION ACT ______ speech of HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Charlotte Nurge, a constituent of mine who passed away at the age of 95 on June 29 of this year in Ashburn, Virginia. Charlotte was born in New Jersey and moved to Virginia in the 1940s. Since the first day she moved to Loudoun County, Charlotte worked tirelessly to improve the lives of her neighbors. Beginning her life of public service in the administrative offices of Langley High School, Charlotte never complained about working long hours. Known as the ``Mayor of Ashby Ponds'', the Ashburn retirement community in which she lived, Charlotte gave more than 3,300 volunteer hours of service to her community since the 1990s. She worked tirelessly to enhance benefits for seniors in my district through her work on the Loudoun County Tax Relief program, and I worked closely with her as chairperson of the Commission on Aging. Always willing to lend a hand to a neighbor in need, Charlotte was an irreplaceable pillar of our community, as noted by her regular attendance at the Loudoun County Board meetings well into her 90s. Charlotte will be sincerely missed by all those who had the pleasure of knowing her both on a personal and a professional level. I know that she has impacted many lives over the years, and we are all grateful for having known her. She is survived by two daughters, Barbara and Catherine; five grandchildren, John, Michael, Monday, Tom and Bridget; and six great-grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the life of, and bidding farewell to, Charlotte Nurge.

Mr. Speaker, I submit the following extraneous materials on H.R. 5456, the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2016: [[Page E1067]] North American Council on Adoptable Children, St. Paul, MN, June 14, 2016. Hon. Kevin Brady, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Orrin Hatch, Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington DC. Hon. Vern Buchanan, Chairman, Human Resources Subcommittee, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Sander Levin, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Ron Wyden, Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington DC. Hon. Lloyd Doggett, Ranking Member, Human Resources Subcommittee, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chairmen Brady and Hatch, Ranking Members Levin and Wyden, and Chairman Buchanan and Ranking Member Doggett: The North American Council on Adoptable Children (NACAC) is pleased to support the Family First Prevention Services Act, and we look forward to working with you to ensure passage and implementation of this important legislation. NACAC is a national organization dedicated to the belief that children and youth need and deserve a permanent family. I want to particularly highlight three provisions of the Act: We were glad to see that the act specifically mentions that Title IV-E will be able to cover preventive services for adoptive and guardianship families, along with birth families and relative caregivers. We have known far too many adoptive families who have been told that their children must reenter foster care to access services. In some of these cases, adoptive families must be charged with abuse and neglect for their children to receive the services they need. The Act will expand the availability of such services and reflects the reality that many families, including adoptive families, need targeted, effective services to meet their children's needs and prevent foster care entry. The emphasis on family-based placements rather than group care is something that NACAC has long supported. We firmly believe that far too many children are placed in group care for no therapeutic reason, which research suggests can harm children. We also know that placement with relatives or foster families increases the likelihood that children will achieve permanency, whether through reunification, kin placement, guardianship, or adoption. Group care has a place in the child welfare system when it is therapeutic and effective, never as a convenient default. Finally, we are pleased to see that the Government Accounting Office will study and report on how states are reinvesting the funds they receive as a result of the Fostering Connections Act's expansion of Title IV-E adoption assistance eligibility. We know that too few families currently have access to needed post-adoption and post- guardianship services, and think these reinvested funds can be a valuable tool to support families post-permanency. We are also pleased to see the reauthorization of Title IV- B and the Adoption and Guardianship Incentive Program. The incentive program has been an important source of funding for support services for adoptive and guardian families. In addition, we strongly support increased investment in services to prevent foster placements for all families, the supports for kinship care providers, and the expansion of the National Electronic Interstate Compact Enterprise. We have seen through the pilot that the use of such a system will speed placements of children in foster care and adoption. We acknowledge that the Act would delay the implementation of expanded IV-E eligibility to children under age four, but we believe that the bill's provisions are so important that we are able to support this offset. We will offer support in implementation of the Act to ensure that the post-adoption services in the bill are available to families who need them and that states are investing in efforts to recruit, develop, and support foster and kin families for children who would otherwise be in group care. We will also review the GAO study to ensure that states are investing as required in post-adoption and post- guardianship services. Thank you again for your support of these valuable improvements in our child welfare system. Please let me know if you need anything from us as you move forward with the Act. Sincerely, Mary Boo, Executive Director. ____ The National Crittenton Foundation, Portland, OR, June 14, 2016. Hon. Kevin Brady, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives. Hon. Orrin Hatch, Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate. Hon. Vern Buchanan, Chairman, Human Resources Subcommittee, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives. Hon. Sandy Levin, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives. Hon. Ron Wyden, Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate. Hon. Lloyd Doggett, Ranking Member, Human Resources Subcommittee, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives. Dear Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee Chairmen Brady and Hatch, Ranking Members Levin and Wyden and Human Resources Subcommittee Chairman Buchanan and Ranking Member Doggett: On behalf of The National Crittenton Foundation, I am pleased to support the Family First Prevention Services Act (H.R. 5456) introduced today by House Ways and Means Human Resources Subcommittee Chairman Vern Buchanan (R-FL) and joined by eleven other bi-partisan original co-sponsors. We understand that the development of this proposed legislation has been a long and complex process, and believe that this bipartisan compromise represents a positive step toward reducing the unnecessary reliance on group care while also improving critical prevention services for children in or at risk of entering the child welfare system. Headquartered in Portland, Oregon, TNCF's mission is to advance the self-empowerment, health, economic security and civic engagement of girls and young women impacted by violence, childhood adversity and trauma. TNCF and its 26- member Family of Agencies currently serve 31 states and the District of Columbia and have more than 130 years of expertise in delivering the highest quality of gender and culturally-specific, trauma-informed, strengths-based and developmentally-appropriate services to girls and young women involved in the child welfare, juvenile justice and other child and family service systems. Among the many populations of young people it serves, the Crittenton Family of Agencies has a particular interest and expertise in providing cutting-edge supports for pregnant and parenting girls and young women, both those who are at risk of child welfare involvement and those already in the foster care system. As you know, these young women represent a relatively small percentage of the overall population of children in foster care, but they face a number of critical challenges, most notably the unnecessary separation from or permanent removal of their own children. When pregnant and parenting youth do not receive the comprehensive range of services they need to parent effectively, the result is often long-term, dual-generation involvement in the child welfare system. The proposed legislation supports the young people we serve in several important ways. Most importantly, it allows federal Title IV-E foster care funding to be used for time- limited, evidence-based services for those young people who are at imminent risk of entering or re-entering foster care, pregnant and parenting youth in foster care and parents and kinship caregivers of children at risk. Expanding states' ability to direct critical dollars towards prevention will help young people who seek help from our agencies access services in the community, especially those young parents who need basic community services and supports to stay together with their children. In addition, the elimination of time limits for family reunification services will be extremely helpful in providing ongoing support for young children after they have returned home to their parents, including parents who are teens. The National Crittenton Foundation is also supportive of the proposed approach to eliminating inappropriate group care. As you know, our agencies strongly believe that children belong in families whenever possible. They work extensively with state and local child welfare agencies, other community-based organizations, and families to provide a range of services--from prevention to post-permanency services--to help children return home or transition to kinship care. Our agencies also understand first hand that children are too often placed in poorly regulated group settings without comprehensive assessments and timely and clinically appropriate placements. By clearly defining Qualified Residential Treatment Programs (QRTP) and requiring timely and comprehensive assessments and careful ongoing court review, we believe that this legislation balances the need to address the treatment needs of young people and reduce the over-reliance on group home placements. In addition, the provisions to support young pregnant and parenting teens will help ensure that those young women who do not have supportive family placement options or kinship resources are able to access the services they need before and after the birth of their children. Finally, TNCF is pleased to see the additional reporting requirements for children who are not placed in family foster care homes. Accurate data collection on residential treatment, hospital-settings and those individuals who are pregnant and parenting will be instrumental in helping our agencies better meet the needs of young people by identifying gaps in services and supports. Thank you all for your strong leadership and bipartisan coordination on these important issues and for your ongoing commitment to children and their families. Sincerely, Jeannette Pai-Espinosa, President. [[Page E1068]] Catholic Charities USA, June 21, 2016. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Representative: On behalf of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development and Catholic Charities USA, we write in support of H.R. 5456, the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2016. In his recent Apostolic Exhortation, Amoris Laetitia, Pope Francis wrote: The choice of adoption and foster care expresses a particular kind of fruitfulness in the marriage experience. . . . In the light of those situations where a child is desired at any cost, as a right for one's self-fulfilment, adoption and foster care, correctly understood, manifest an important aspect of parenting and the raising of children. They make people aware that children, whether natural, adoptive or taken in foster care, are persons in their own right who need to be accepted, loved and cared for, and not just brought into this world. The best interests of the child should always underlie any decision in adoption and foster care (no. 180). The Church thus recognizes and values the often heroic witness of those who provide loving foster care to children in need. At the same time, we understand that, where possible, meaningful support for families experiencing serious challenges can be critically important. For some, well-timed assistance can help keep families together, strengthening child outcomes and building toward long-term thriving. Catholic Charities has extensive experience, both in supporting families with mental health care, substance abuse treatment and parenting skills training, and in providing foster care support. Last year alone over 11,000 children received foster care support and over 1,500 children were adopted from foster care programs through Catholic Charities supported programs. Given our deep understanding and concern for family and our breadth of experience in helping parents in need, we urge you to pass H.R. 5456. Among the commendable provisions are: Resources to assist parents with mental health, substance abuse or parenting skill issues to increase opportunities for children to remain in their homes where safe to do so; Increased priority for placing children with other family members or in family foster settings; Funding for evidence-based services to prevent child abuse and neglect related to substance abuse; Additional support for the transition of foster children into adulthood. As Saint John Paul II remarked, ``As the family goes, so goes the nation, and so goes the whole world in which we live'' (homily, Perth, Australia, November 30, 1986). The importance of supporting parents, children and families by improving the foster care system is critical for the good of our nation. Please support H.R. 5456. Sincerely yours, Most Reverend Thomas G. Wenski, Archbishop of Miami, Chairman, Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development. Sr. Donna Markham, OP, Ph.D., President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA. June 21, 2016. Hon. Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Speaker of the House Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: As organizations representing advocates for children, youth and families, public and private providers, foster parents, adoptive parents, kinship caregivers and alumni of foster care, we are writing in support of the bipartisan, bicameral Family First Prevention Services Act, H.R. 5456. This legislation represents an historic step forward by better aligning federal child welfare funding with improved outcomes and goals for children and families who come into contact with the child welfare system. Over the decades Congress has approved many bipartisan, bicameral child welfare bills to better meet the needs of our most vulnerable children and families, and the Family First Prevention Services Act continues to make important gains for children. We applaud the historic step the Act takes to increase federal investments in prevention to keep more children safely with their parents or family caregivers and out of foster care. The Act would allow funds under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, now used primarily for out-of-home care for children, to be used for quality mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services and in-home parent skill-based programs. Requirements that these new services be evidence-based and trauma-informed, along with data reporting on performance outcomes, helps to ensure the quality of and accountability for services provided. These and other provisions in the Act also recognize the current challenges created by the opioid and heroin crises in many states. The Family First Prevention Services Act over time also will take important steps to ensure children who need foster care will be placed in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs, by targeting federal dollars only on children in family-foster homes or residential settings for children and youth with special treatment needs or those in special circumstances, such as pregnant and parenting teens or older youth in independent living settings. The Act builds on activities in a number of states to preserve group care for children with special treatment needs. The Act includes a number of other important changes to help improve outcomes for children and families. It continues to recognize the special role grandparents and other relatives play when they step in to care for children when their parents cannot and the supports relative caregivers need; requires states to have a plan to track and prevent child maltreatment fatalities; addresses the special needs of pregnant and parenting teens and protections for their children; promotes permanent families for children by extending adoption and guardianship incentives, enhancing interstate placements of children, and ensuring appropriate investments in post-adoption services; continues the Court Improvement Program; and offers increased supports to help older youth transition from foster care to adulthood. Children and society pay a high cost when current systems fail to adequately address the needs of the children who come to the attention of our child welfare systems. We believe the specific changes proposed will go far in encouraging state and local child welfare agencies, private providers, courts, and advocates for children and families, including those who have been involved in the child welfare system, to work together to achieve significant change for children over the next decade. The Family First Prevention Services Act will truly benefit vulnerable children and families who come to the attention of the child welfare system. We urge strong bipartisan support of H.R. 5456.

Most importantly, it allows federal Title IV-E foster care funding to be used for time- limited, evidence-based services for those young people who are at imminent risk of entering or re-entering foster care, pregnant and parenting youth in foster care and parents and kinship caregivers of children at risk. Expanding states' ability to direct critical dollars towards prevention will help young people who seek help from our agencies access services in the community, especially those young parents who need basic community services and supports to stay together with their children. In addition, the elimination of time limits for family reunification services will be extremely helpful in providing ongoing support for young children after they have returned home to their parents, including parents who are teens. The National Crittenton Foundation is also supportive of the proposed approach to eliminating inappropriate group care. As you know, our agencies strongly believe that children belong in families whenever possible. They work extensively with state and local child welfare agencies, other community-based organizations, and families to provide a range of services--from prevention to post-permanency services--to help children return home or transition to kinship care. Our agencies also understand first hand that children are too often placed in poorly regulated group settings without comprehensive assessments and timely and clinically appropriate placements. By clearly defining Qualified Residential Treatment Programs (QRTP) and requiring timely and comprehensive assessments and careful ongoing court review, we believe that this legislation balances the need to address the treatment needs of young people and reduce the over-reliance on group home placements. In addition, the provisions to support young pregnant and parenting teens will help ensure that those young women who do not have supportive family placement options or kinship resources are able to access the services they need before and after the birth of their children. Finally, TNCF is pleased to see the additional reporting requirements for children who are not placed in family foster care homes. Accurate data collection on residential treatment, hospital-settings and those individuals who are pregnant and parenting will be instrumental in helping our agencies better meet the needs of young people by identifying gaps in services and supports. Thank you all for your strong leadership and bipartisan coordination on these important issues and for your ongoing commitment to children and their families. Sincerely, Jeannette Pai-Espinosa, President. [[Page E1068]] Catholic Charities USA, June 21, 2016. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Representative: On behalf of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development and Catholic Charities USA, we write in support of H.R. 5456, the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2016. In his recent Apostolic Exhortation, Amoris Laetitia, Pope Francis wrote: The choice of adoption and foster care expresses a particular kind of fruitfulness in the marriage experience. . . . In the light of those situations where a child is desired at any cost, as a right for one's self-fulfilment, adoption and foster care, correctly understood, manifest an important aspect of parenting and the raising of children. They make people aware that children, whether natural, adoptive or taken in foster care, are persons in their own right who need to be accepted, loved and cared for, and not just brought into this world. The best interests of the child should always underlie any decision in adoption and foster care (no. 180). The Church thus recognizes and values the often heroic witness of those who provide loving foster care to children in need. At the same time, we understand that, where possible, meaningful support for families experiencing serious challenges can be critically important. For some, well-timed assistance can help keep families together, strengthening child outcomes and building toward long-term thriving. Catholic Charities has extensive experience, both in supporting families with mental health care, substance abuse treatment and parenting skills training, and in providing foster care support. Last year alone over 11,000 children received foster care support and over 1,500 children were adopted from foster care programs through Catholic Charities supported programs. Given our deep understanding and concern for family and our breadth of experience in helping parents in need, we urge you to pass H.R. 5456. Among the commendable provisions are: Resources to assist parents with mental health, substance abuse or parenting skill issues to increase opportunities for children to remain in their homes where safe to do so; Increased priority for placing children with other family members or in family foster settings; Funding for evidence-based services to prevent child abuse and neglect related to substance abuse; Additional support for the transition of foster children into adulthood. As Saint John Paul II remarked, ``As the family goes, so goes the nation, and so goes the whole world in which we live'' (homily, Perth, Australia, November 30, 1986). The importance of supporting parents, children and families by improving the foster care system is critical for the good of our nation. Please support H.R. 5456. Sincerely yours, Most Reverend Thomas G. Wenski, Archbishop of Miami, Chairman, Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development. Sr. Donna Markham, OP, Ph.D., President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA. June 21, 2016. Hon. Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Speaker of the House Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: As organizations representing advocates for children, youth and families, public and private providers, foster parents, adoptive parents, kinship caregivers and alumni of foster care, we are writing in support of the bipartisan, bicameral Family First Prevention Services Act, H.R. 5456. This legislation represents an historic step forward by better aligning federal child welfare funding with improved outcomes and goals for children and families who come into contact with the child welfare system. Over the decades Congress has approved many bipartisan, bicameral child welfare bills to better meet the needs of our most vulnerable children and families, and the Family First Prevention Services Act continues to make important gains for children. We applaud the historic step the Act takes to increase federal investments in prevention to keep more children safely with their parents or family caregivers and out of foster care. The Act would allow funds under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, now used primarily for out-of-home care for children, to be used for quality mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services and in-home parent skill-based programs. Requirements that these new services be evidence-based and trauma-informed, along with data reporting on performance outcomes, helps to ensure the quality of and accountability for services provided. These and other provisions in the Act also recognize the current challenges created by the opioid and heroin crises in many states. The Family First Prevention Services Act over time also will take important steps to ensure children who need foster care will be placed in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs, by targeting federal dollars only on children in family-foster homes or residential settings for children and youth with special treatment needs or those in special circumstances, such as pregnant and parenting teens or older youth in independent living settings. The Act builds on activities in a number of states to preserve group care for children with special treatment needs. The Act includes a number of other important changes to help improve outcomes for children and families. It continues to recognize the special role grandparents and other relatives play when they step in to care for children when their parents cannot and the supports relative caregivers need; requires states to have a plan to track and prevent child maltreatment fatalities; addresses the special needs of pregnant and parenting teens and protections for their children; promotes permanent families for children by extending adoption and guardianship incentives, enhancing interstate placements of children, and ensuring appropriate investments in post-adoption services; continues the Court Improvement Program; and offers increased supports to help older youth transition from foster care to adulthood. Children and society pay a high cost when current systems fail to adequately address the needs of the children who come to the attention of our child welfare systems. We believe the specific changes proposed will go far in encouraging state and local child welfare agencies, private providers, courts, and advocates for children and families, including those who have been involved in the child welfare system, to work together to achieve significant change for children over the next decade. The Family First Prevention Services Act will truly benefit vulnerable children and families who come to the attention of the child welfare system. We urge strong bipartisan support of H.R. 5456.

Mr. Speaker, I submit the following extraneous materials on H.R. 5456, the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2016: [[Page E1067]] North American Council on Adoptable Children, St. Paul, MN, June 14, 2016. Hon. Kevin Brady, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Orrin Hatch, Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington DC. Hon. Vern Buchanan, Chairman, Human Resources Subcommittee, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Sander Levin, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Ron Wyden, Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington DC. Hon. Lloyd Doggett, Ranking Member, Human Resources Subcommittee, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chairmen Brady and Hatch, Ranking Members Levin and Wyden, and Chairman Buchanan and Ranking Member Doggett: The North American Council on Adoptable Children (NACAC) is pleased to support the Family First Prevention Services Act, and we look forward to working with you to ensure passage and implementation of this important legislation. NACAC is a national organization dedicated to the belief that children and youth need and deserve a permanent family. I want to particularly highlight three provisions of the Act: We were glad to see that the act specifically mentions that Title IV-E will be able to cover preventive services for adoptive and guardianship families, along with birth families and relative caregivers. We have known far too many adoptive families who have been told that their children must reenter foster care to access services. In some of these cases, adoptive families must be charged with abuse and neglect for their children to receive the services they need. The Act will expand the availability of such services and reflects the reality that many families, including adoptive families, need targeted, effective services to meet their children's needs and prevent foster care entry. The emphasis on family-based placements rather than group care is something that NACAC has long supported. We firmly believe that far too many children are placed in group care for no therapeutic reason, which research suggests can harm children. We also know that placement with relatives or foster families increases the likelihood that children will achieve permanency, whether through reunification, kin placement, guardianship, or adoption. Group care has a place in the child welfare system when it is therapeutic and effective, never as a convenient default. Finally, we are pleased to see that the Government Accounting Office will study and report on how states are reinvesting the funds they receive as a result of the Fostering Connections Act's expansion of Title IV-E adoption assistance eligibility. We know that too few families currently have access to needed post-adoption and post- guardianship services, and think these reinvested funds can be a valuable tool to support families post-permanency. We are also pleased to see the reauthorization of Title IV- B and the Adoption and Guardianship Incentive Program. The incentive program has been an important source of funding for support services for adoptive and guardian families. In addition, we strongly support increased investment in services to prevent foster placements for all families, the supports for kinship care providers, and the expansion of the National Electronic Interstate Compact Enterprise. We have seen through the pilot that the use of such a system will speed placements of children in foster care and adoption. We acknowledge that the Act would delay the implementation of expanded IV-E eligibility to children under age four, but we believe that the bill's provisions are so important that we are able to support this offset. We will offer support in implementation of the Act to ensure that the post-adoption services in the bill are available to families who need them and that states are investing in efforts to recruit, develop, and support foster and kin families for children who would otherwise be in group care. We will also review the GAO study to ensure that states are investing as required in post-adoption and post- guardianship services. Thank you again for your support of these valuable improvements in our child welfare system. Please let me know if you need anything from us as you move forward with the Act. Sincerely, Mary Boo, Executive Director. ____ The National Crittenton Foundation, Portland, OR, June 14, 2016. Hon. Kevin Brady, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives. Hon. Orrin Hatch, Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate. Hon. Vern Buchanan, Chairman, Human Resources Subcommittee, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives. Hon.

Lloyd Doggett, Ranking Member, Human Resources Subcommittee, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives. Dear Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee Chairmen Brady and Hatch, Ranking Members Levin and Wyden and Human Resources Subcommittee Chairman Buchanan and Ranking Member Doggett: On behalf of The National Crittenton Foundation, I am pleased to support the Family First Prevention Services Act (H.R. 5456) introduced today by House Ways and Means Human Resources Subcommittee Chairman Vern Buchanan (R-FL) and joined by eleven other bi-partisan original co-sponsors. We understand that the development of this proposed legislation has been a long and complex process, and believe that this bipartisan compromise represents a positive step toward reducing the unnecessary reliance on group care while also improving critical prevention services for children in or at risk of entering the child welfare system. Headquartered in Portland, Oregon, TNCF's mission is to advance the self-empowerment, health, economic security and civic engagement of girls and young women impacted by violence, childhood adversity and trauma. TNCF and its 26- member Family of Agencies currently serve 31 states and the District of Columbia and have more than 130 years of expertise in delivering the highest quality of gender and culturally-specific, trauma-informed, strengths-based and developmentally-appropriate services to girls and young women involved in the child welfare, juvenile justice and other child and family service systems. Among the many populations of young people it serves, the Crittenton Family of Agencies has a particular interest and expertise in providing cutting-edge supports for pregnant and parenting girls and young women, both those who are at risk of child welfare involvement and those already in the foster care system. As you know, these young women represent a relatively small percentage of the overall population of children in foster care, but they face a number of critical challenges, most notably the unnecessary separation from or permanent removal of their own children. When pregnant and parenting youth do not receive the comprehensive range of services they need to parent effectively, the result is often long-term, dual-generation involvement in the child welfare system. The proposed legislation supports the young people we serve in several important ways. Most importantly, it allows federal Title IV-E foster care funding to be used for time- limited, evidence-based services for those young people who are at imminent risk of entering or re-entering foster care, pregnant and parenting youth in foster care and parents and kinship caregivers of children at risk.

in several important ways. most importantly, it allows federal title iv-e foster care funding to be used for time- limited, evidence-based services for those young people who are at imminent risk of entering or re-entering foster care, pregnant and parenting youth in foster care and parents and kinship caregivers of children at risk. expanding states' ability to direct critical dollars towards prevention will help young people who seek help from our agencies access services in the community, especially those young parents who need basic community services and supports to stay together with their children. in addition, the elimination of time limits for family reunification services will be extremely helpful in providing ongoing support for young children after they have returned home to their parents, including parents who are teens. the national crittenton foundation is also supportive of the proposed approach to eliminating inappropriate group care. as you know, our agencies strongly believe that children belong in families whenever possible. they work extensively with state and local child welfare agencies, other community-based organizations, and families to provide a range of services--from prevention to post-permanency services--to help children return home or transition to kinship care. our agencies also understand first hand that children are too often placed in poorly regulated group settings without comprehensive assessments and timely and clinically appropriate placements. by clearly defining qualified residential treatment programs (qrtp) and requiring timely and comprehensive assessments and careful ongoing court review, we believe that this legislation balances the need to address the treatment needs of young people and reduce the over-reliance on group home placements. in addition, the provisions to support young pregnant and parenting teens will help ensure that those young women who do not have supportive family placement options or kinship resources are able to access the services they need before and after the birth of their children. finally, tncf is pleased to see the additional reporting requirements for children who are not placed in family foster care homes. accurate data collection on residential treatment, hospital-settings and those individuals who are pregnant and parenting will be instrumental in helping our agencies better meet the needs of young people by identifying gaps in services and supports. thank you all for your strong leadership and bipartisan coordination on these important issues and for your ongoing commitment to children and their families. sincerely, jeannette pai-espinosa, president. [[page e1068]] catholic charities usa, june 21, 2016. house of representatives, washington, dc. dear representative: on behalf of the united states conference of catholic bishops' committee on domestic justice and human development and catholic charities usa, we write in support of h.r. 5456, the family first prevention services act of 2016. in his recent apostolic exhortation, amoris laetitia, pope francis wrote: the choice of adoption and foster care expresses a particular kind of fruitfulness in the marriage experience. . . . in the light of those situations where a child is desired at any cost, as a right for one's self-fulfilment, adoption and foster care, correctly understood, manifest an important aspect of parenting and the raising of children. they make people aware that children, whether natural, adoptive or taken in foster care, are persons in their own right who need to be accepted, loved and cared for, and not just brought into this world. the best interests of the child should always underlie any decision in adoption and foster care (no. 180). the church thus recognizes and values the often heroic witness of those who provide loving foster care to children in need. at the same time, we understand that, where possible, meaningful support for families experiencing serious challenges can be critically important. for some, well-timed assistance can help keep families together, strengthening child outcomes and building toward long-term thriving. catholic charities has extensive experience, both in supporting families with mental health care, substance abuse treatment and parenting skills training, and in providing foster care support. last year alone over 11,000 children received foster care support and over 1,500 children were adopted from foster care programs through catholic charities supported programs. given our deep understanding and concern for family and our breadth of experience in helping parents in need, we urge you to pass h.r. 5456. among the commendable provisions are: resources to assist parents with mental health, substance abuse or parenting skill issues to increase opportunities for children to remain in their homes where safe to do so; increased priority for placing children with other family members or in family foster settings; funding for evidence-based services to prevent child abuse and neglect related to substance abuse; additional support for the transition of foster children into adulthood. as saint john paul ii remarked, ``as the family goes, so goes the nation, and so goes the whole world in which we live'' (homily, perth, australia, november 30, 1986). the importance of supporting parents, children and families by improving the foster care system is critical for the good of our nation. please support h.r. 5456. sincerely yours, most reverend thomas g. wenski, archbishop of miami, chairman, committee on domestic justice and human development. sr. donna markham, op, ph.d., president & ceo, catholic charities usa. june 21, 2016. hon. paul ryan, speaker of the house, house of representatives, washington, dc. hon. nancy pelosi, minority leader, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear speaker of the house ryan and minority leader pelosi: as organizations representing advocates for children, youth and families, public and private providers, foster parents, adoptive parents, kinship caregivers and alumni of foster care, we are writing in support of the bipartisan, bicameral family first prevention services act, h.r. 5456. this legislation represents an historic step forward by better aligning federal child welfare funding with improved outcomes and goals for children and families who come into contact with the child welfare system. over the decades congress has approved many bipartisan, bicameral child welfare bills to better meet the needs of our most vulnerable children and families, and the family first prevention services act continues to make important gains for children. we applaud the historic step the act takes to increase federal investments in prevention to keep more children safely with their parents or family caregivers and out of foster care. the act would allow funds under title iv-e of the social security act, now used primarily for out-of-home care for children, to be used for quality mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services and in-home parent skill-based programs. requirements that these new services be evidence-based and trauma-informed, along with data reporting on performance outcomes, helps to ensure the quality of and accountability for services provided. these and other provisions in the act also recognize the current challenges created by the opioid and heroin crises in many states. the family first prevention services act over time also will take important steps to ensure children who need foster care will be placed in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs, by targeting federal dollars only on children in family-foster homes or residential settings for children and youth with special treatment needs or those in special circumstances, such as pregnant and parenting teens or older youth in independent living settings. the act builds on activities in a number of states to preserve group care for children with special treatment needs. the act includes a number of other important changes to help improve outcomes for children and families. it continues to recognize the special role grandparents and other relatives play when they step in to care for children when their parents cannot and the supports relative caregivers need; requires states to have a plan to track and prevent child maltreatment fatalities; addresses the special needs of pregnant and parenting teens and protections for their children; promotes permanent families for children by extending adoption and guardianship incentives, enhancing interstate placements of children, and ensuring appropriate investments in post-adoption services; continues the court improvement program; and offers increased supports to help older youth transition from foster care to adulthood. children and society pay a high cost when current systems fail to adequately address the needs of the children who come to the attention of our child welfare systems. we believe the specific changes proposed will go far in encouraging state and local child welfare agencies, private providers, courts, and advocates for children and families, including those who have been involved in the child welfare system, to work together to achieve significant change for children over the next decade. the family first prevention services act will truly benefit vulnerable children and families who come to the attention of the child welfare system. we urge strong bipartisan support of h.r. 5456. thank you. sincerely, national organizations: adoption exchange association american academy of pediatrics american psychological association association of university centers on disabilities center for native american youth center for the study of social policy child care aware of america children and family futures children's home society of america children's hospital association children's rights children's advocacy institute children's defense fund children's leadership council clasp coalition on human needs csh (corporation for supportive housing) dave thomas foundation for adoption every child matters first focus campaign for children foster family-based treatment association fosterclub generations united healthy teen network human rights project for girls (rights4girls) juvenile law center national african american drug policy coalition, inc. national alliance of children's trust and prevention funds national association for children of alcoholics national association for children's behavioral health national association of counsel for children national association of pediatric nurse practitioners national association of social workers national center on adoption and permanency national center on child welfare and housing national center on shared leadership national child abuse coalition national children's alliance national family preservation network national foster parent association national indian child welfare association national kinship alliance for children north american council on adoptable children parents anonymous inc. ray e. helfer society strengthening families all across america the dalton daley group the national campaign to prevent teen and unplanned pregnancy the national crittenton foundation think of us voice for adoption youth law center youth villages zero to three state organizations: adoptive and foster families of maine, inc. and the kinship program aaj research & evaluation (florida) arizona's children association casa youth advocates (pennsylania) child and family services of new hampshire children & families first (delaware) children awaiting parents (new york) children's action alliance (arizona) children's home + aid (illinois) children's home society of north carolina children's advocacy alliance (nevada) [[page e1069]] children's defense fund--california children's defense fund--minnesota children's defense fund--mississippi children's defense fund--new york children's defense fund--texas children's hospital of wisconsin citizens' committee for children of new york, inc. connecticut voices for children dakota boys and girls ranch (north dakota) florida's children first, inc. foster adopt connect (missouri and kansas) lutheran social service of minnesota lutheran social services of indiana massachusetts adoption resource exchange massachusetts law reform institute partners for our children (washington) the children's hospital of philadelphia the children's partnership (california) university of california davis guardian professions program voices for children in nebraska voices for ohio's children voices for virginia's children ymca of san diego county, kinship support program ____________________",20425

ANN M. KUSTER of new hampshire in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Derek and Dylan Thomson, both of whom are New Hampshire residents who have committed themselves to cycling across the United States to raise awareness and funds for the Connolly Tough Fund. The Thomson brothers have dedicated themselves to biking from San Francisco, California to Seabrook, New Hampshire, a 4,500 trek in order to raise awareness for ALS as well as funds for their former principal, Gene Connolly, who was recently diagnosed with the disease. It is with great pride and respect that I join others in congratulating and thanking them for their tremendous efforts. The Connolly Tough Fund was started in September 2014 to help Gene Connolly's family with expenses and have since risen over $85,000. Derek and Dylan Thomson hoped to raise an additional $20,000 through fundraising efforts throughout their bike ride. At this time, they have risen over $14,000. The Connolly Tough Fund has transferred their focus to supporting a scholarship fund in Gene's name. This decision follows Mr. Connolly's decision to retire from Concord High School. This retirement ends Mr. Connolly's 38-year public school career in New Hampshire, serving students like the Thomson brothers selflessly and tirelessly. While the fund has transferred its attention, the Thomson brothers are committing themselves to aiding Mr. Connolly, directly, through their fundraising program. Derek and Dylan's journey is a personal and selfless act. Gene Connolly aided Derek in finding his passion for filmmaking and mentored him through his college experience at both Keene State College and Emerson University. For this, Derek is determined to ``pay back Connolly for his generosity and inspiration.'' Derek has created films for Mr. Connolly and his family and became inspired to help monetarily, with his brother, through this bike riding effort. Dylan, also a recent graduate, is completing this ride before heading to University of New Hampshire this fall. The brothers started their cross-country trek on May 21st and hope to finish by mid-July. They should be commended for their tenacity and commitment. Derek and Dylan Thomson have been tireless in their commitment to the Connolly Tough Fund and have improved the Connolly family's life tremendously. Their work, both in Concord and on their bikes have helped Gene Connolly and his family throughout this transformative experience. As Mr. Connolly stated in a film, made by Derek, these brothers are helping ``to the best of their ability.'' Derek and Dylan Thomson are role models for all of us and I applaud them for their efforts. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1066] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF DEREK AND DYLAN THOMSON FOR THEIR EFFORTS ON THE CONNOLLY TOUGH FUND ______ HON.

STEVE COHEN of tennessee in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bipartisan bill I introduced today with several of my colleagues to authorize a statue of Elie Wiesel to be placed in the U.S. Capitol building. Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel was a great American, whose moral leadership served as a beacon across our country and around the globe. President Obama rightly called him, ``the conscience of the world.'' Wiesel was born in Romania in 1928. In 1944, at the age of fifteen, Elie Wiesel was sent to the Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz, and later to Buchenwald. Both of his parents and his younger sister died in the concentration camps. After the war, Elie Wiesel became a journalist and wrote about his experiences during the Holocaust. He spent his life as a vocal witness against both the evil that gave rise to the Holocaust and man's inhumanity against his fellow man. His purpose was to speak the truth in the face of power and to clearly and repeatedly say ``Never Again.'' His memoir, Night, has been translated into over 30 languages. He fought against indifference, intolerance, and injustice. He helped create the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Elie Wiesel was one of the greatest moral forces in the world. He was brilliant, pure, honest, and courageous. I met Elie Wiesel when I was a Tennessee State Senator and he was honored at Vanderbilt. He was the inspiration for me founding the Tennessee Holocaust Commission in 1987. I have a picture of him and me hanging in the foyer of my Washington, DC office. The photo was taken when he was honored at the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis. His voice was strong and will be sorely missed. He was one of my heroes. I urge my colleagues to help pass this bill. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1069] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TO COMMISSION A STATUE OF ELIE WIESEL TO BE PLACED IN THE CAPITOL ______ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 5, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1252, the ``Global Food Security Act of 2015,'' which requires the President to develop and implement a Global Food Security Strategy to reduce hunger and maintain global food security and nutrition. Even in an age of globalization and industrialization, hunger and food security remain fundamental impediments to global wellbeing. According to UN estimates, 795 people currently live undernourished lives, with 12.9 percent of the population of underdeveloped countries living without proper nutrition and 3.1 million children under the age of five dying of malnutrition every year. Moreover, with the world's natural resources and biodiversity rapidly degrading, global food security continues to be threatened, as one of the global economy's most crucial driving forces, agriculture, continues to suffer globally, and particularly in underdeveloped states. Even as the threats of hunger and food instability loom, the necessity of global food security remains, as solutions to global food issues also represent instrumental steps to poverty eradication and economic growth. In an age where food concerns plague underdeveloped nations and largely industrialized international powers alike, moreover, it is more important than ever to remain committed to proven food initiatives and measures of global food assistance. In particular, the Food Security Act specifies the importance of promoting activities and programs that strive to promote global food security, resilience, and nutrition. These measures include programs that: 1. place food insecure countries on a path toward self-sufficiency by coordinating U.S. assistance programs; 2. accelerate agricultural and economic growth in a manner that reduces global poverty, hunger, and malnutrition; 3. increase the productivity and livelihoods of small-scale producers; [[Page E1070]] 4. build resilience to food shocks in vulnerable populations; 5. create an environment for agricultural growth and investment; 6. improve the nutritional status of women and children globally; 7. align with existing U.S. strategies and investments to achieve these objectives; 8. and strengthen relationships between U.S. and foreign universities that contribute to agricultural growth. In addition, this measure specifies that the President must coordinate a comprehensive government strategy to promote global food security by coordinating across federal departments and agencies to provide assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prevent or address food shortages. The President's annual report to Congress on the implementation of these specifications and measures will enable continued monitoring and evaluation of the success of these strategies. This measure is integral to restoring global food security, and represents a vital step in the global war against world hunger. I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass S. 1252. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1069-E1070] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY ACT OF 2016 ______ speech of HON.

MIKVA ______ HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY of illinois in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life and legacy of Abner Mikva and to send my deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. Abner Mikva was one of the most treasured friends I've had in all my life. He was an indispensable mentor, a consistent role model and a great guy to be around. It is somehow fitting, that a man so completely devoted to public service--a true American patriot--would take his last breath on the 4th of July. Ab is revered in the district I now represent, which first elected him to Congress in 1974. I was one of the countless volunteers who passed his flyers out and knocked on doors. He inspired a whole generation to believe that politics is a noble calling. His grassroots election campaigns that engaged literally thousands of young people wearing his trademark Mikva! T-shirts are legendary. He was a brilliant strategist, able to work across the aisle, but never compromising his core progressive beliefs. One of the few Americans to serve in all three branches of government as a Congressman, Federal Judge and White House Counsel, Abner was committed to advocating government that was the most helpful it could be to the most people possible. His legacy lives on in the Abner and Zoe (his beloved wife and partner) Mikva Challenge, a program that places high school student interns in both Republican and Democratic offices and campaigns. Thousands of young people for generations to come will experience hands-on involvement in politics because of Ab and Zoe. In November of 2014, I was proud to witness President Obama, someone Ab Mikva supported and promoted from the day he met him, award Ab with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan came to an intimate celebration afterward and spoke fondly about the days she served as Abner's law clerk. His 90th birthday party last February showcased Abner Mikva's enduring wit, intelligence and humanity. He will be deeply, deeply missed by all those who knew, admired, and loved him. I am proud to be one of them. To Abner Mikva's wife Zoe and family, to whom he was completely devoted, I send my gratitude and heartfelt condolences. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1070] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF ABNER J.

An esteemed and respected member of the Army Nurse Corps, Colonel Crozier most recently served as the Deputy Commander for Patient Service and Nursing at Fort Bliss' William Beaumont Medical Center in my district of El Paso, Texas. In this capacity, Colonel Crozier was instrumental in day-to-day operations of the Department of Defense's largest medical treatment facility, comprised of more than 3,700 staff members and 72,000 beneficiaries. He also played an integral role in strengthening the relationship between Fort Bliss and the El Paso community. Colonel Crozier's distinguished career began in 1986 at Fort Gordon, Georgia and included time in Germany; Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort Hood, Texas; Fort Stewart, Georgia; and Fort Sam Houston, Texas. During this time, Colonel Crozier deployed to both Kyrgyzstan and Saudi Arabia in support of humanitarian missions and to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During his time in Iraq, Colonel Crozier served as the Chief Operating Room Nurse at Baghdad's 86th Combat Support Hospital, where he led a team of nurses and [[Page E1071]] medics in performing hundreds of lifesaving surgeries for our service members. As Colonel Crozier embarks on a new chapter in life, it is my hope that he and his family may recall, with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment, the outstanding contributions he has made to the William Beaumont Army Medical Center and to the United States Army. I would like to send him my best wishes for continued success in his future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1070-E1071] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING COLONEL LAWRENCE CROZIER ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the following students of the Gulfport High School Marine Corps JROTC who recently won the Civilian Marksmanship Program's Three Position Air Rifle National Championship in Camp Perry, Ohio: Rebecca Cook, Katy Nevins, Gabrielle Phelps, and Jillian Tyler. These outstanding young women brought the national title home to Mississippi, and I am proud to honor their achievement. Under the leadership of Lt. Col. John Owens and team coach Tammy Smith, the Gulfport High School rifle team is no stranger to the national stage, but the win serves as the program's first national title. These four young women have demonstrated that hard work and dedication will achieve success. As the team competed in a series of events, they defeated 30 other teams from across the United States. This team has continuously shown true leadership and commitment when the team finished first in their regional competition by shooting a record-setting two-day total. At the competition, Rebecca Cook earned medals for placing third on the first day and placing fifth on the second day. Katy Nevins received a bronze medal, finishing third in her age division. Jillian Tyler holds the highest score for the entire match. On behalf of the United States Congress, I would like to send the entire Gulfport High School Marine Corps JROTC team my congratulations.

DAN NEWHOUSE of washington in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce my legislation, the Farm Regulatory Certainty Act. In 2015, a federal judge ruled in a citizen suit that dissolved manure nitrates constitute a ``solid waste'' under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and held four Washington State dairies culpable of ``open dumping'' due to their nutrient management practices. A farmer myself, I firmly believe farmers have and must continue to lead the charge on good stewardship and conservation. While I agree there are a number of statutes that do govern nutrient management practices, Congress never intended for RCRA to be one of those statutes. Moreover, the EPA's regulations confirm that agricultural wastes, such as manures and crop residues, were not intended to be governed under RCRA. This misguided ruling has placed farmers across the country in a legal gray area. It is unfair for agricultural nutrients to be exempt from law, then have a court find farmers at fault for non-compliance with the very law they are exempt from. Farmers need certainty as to what rules apply to them. The legislation I introduce today would clarify and reaffirm that RCRA was not intended to govern nutrient management activities. Moreover, this bill would prevent farmers who are already engaged in legal action and who are diligently working with the state or federal government to address nutrient management issues from being targeted by citizen suits. We want to continue to encourage farmers to be good stewards, and create an environment where farmers can feel comfortable working with state and federal regulatory agencies to address stewardship issues-- not have farmers fear that documents and samples provided to regulators will be acquired by third-parties and used against them in these ``double-jeopardy''-like lawsuits. This commonsense legislation will clarify Congress' intent on this statute, and work to restore a relationship of trust and confidence between farmers and regulators. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1071] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE FARM REGULATORY CERTAINTY ACT ______ HON.

SMOAK'S 100TH BIRTHDAY ______ HON. JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service and career of Ambassador Marion H. Smoak as he celebrates his 100th birthday. Ambassador Smoak has dedicated many years to public service and deserves to be commended for his service and dedication to our country. Ambassador Smoak received a bachelor's degree in English and History from The Citadel in 1938. He went on to receive a law degree from the University of South Carolina Law School in 1941. Shortly after receiving his law degree Ambassador Smoak served in the Army and was stationed in Berlin and New Caledonia, Japan, holding the title of Judge Advocate with the 11th and 82nd Airborne Divisions. Following his tour abroad, he began [[Page E1072]] teaching at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in the Law Department. Upon leaving his position at West Point, Ambassador Smoak became a legislative liaison officer in Washington, D.C. In this position, he assisted in drafting legislation and performed liaison duties with Congress, the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the Department of Defense. During his time in Washington, D.C., Ambassador Smoak became Chief of the Legislative Drafting Division for the Judge Advocate General. He served as Chief until his retirement from military service in 1961, leaving with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Following his retirement from the Army, Ambassador Smoak returned to Aiken County, South Carolina along with his wife, Mary Frances Meister, and their three children, Fred, Mary Frances, and Pat. Serving as a practicing attorney in Aiken County, Ambassador Smoak sought office in the South Carolina State Senate and went on to win the election in 1966. Ambassador Smoak was among the first five Republicans that served in the South Carolina State Senate since Reconstruction. While in the State Senate he served on six committees that included: Agriculture, Atomic and Nuclear Energy, Commerce and Manufactures, Military, and Veteran Affairs. Ambassador Smoak fought for the Compulsory School Bill, realigning voting precincts, and compulsory auto inspections. From 1967 to 1968, he also served in the State Constitutional Revision Commission. Upon completing his term in the Senate, Ambassador Smoak went on to work at the State Department as the Deputy Chief of Protocol and Chief of Protocol for the President and the Secretary of State from 1969 to 1974. During his time at the State Department Ambassador Smoak participated in many significant events including: the inauguration of President Prastrana of Colombia in 1970, the inauguration of President Echeverria of Mexico in 1970, and the funeral of King Frederick IX of Denmark in 1972.

CREC-2016-07-08-pt1-PgE1072,CREC-2016-07-08,114,HONORING JUDGE ROGER L. GREGORY OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1072-E1073] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING JUDGE ROGER L. GREGORY OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT ______ HON. ROBERT C. ``BOBBY'' SCOTT of virginia in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to congratulate Judge Roger L. Gregory on his ascension to the rank of Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on Saturday, July 9, 2016. As the highest ranking judge of the Richmond-based Fourth Circuit, Judge Gregory will preside as ``first among equals'' over 15 active and two senior judges that are responsible for appellate cases rising from Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina--a jurisdiction that includes almost 30 million people. Judge Gregory's service on the bench is historic in a couple of respects. He is the first African American to serve on the Fourth Circuit, which was the only remaining federal circuit in the nation where all of the judges were white. He came to the Fourth Circuit as a recess appointment of President William Jefferson Clinton on December 27, 2000. Despite the bipartisan support of the Commonwealth of Virginia's two U.S. Senators, John Warner (R) and Charles Robb (D)--and the fact that the Fourth Circuit had several vacancies--Judge Gregory's nomination in June 2000 to the Fourth Circuit was effectively blocked by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina who opposed efforts to diversify the courts. Judge Gregory made history again when he became the only person in United States history to have been appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals by presidents of two different political parties. He was reappointed by President George W. Bush, with the support of Senator John Warner and newly elected Senator George Allen, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 20, 2001. During the past 15 years on the bench, Judge Gregory has developed a reputation as a distinguished and brilliant jurist. He is seen as a leader in forging consensus in the Fourth Circuit and providing legal analysis that has helped to evolve the thinking of the court. Judge Gregory was on the panel of judges that heard two groundbreaking cases that were eventually heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2014, Judge Gregory was part of the Fourth Circuit's unanimous ruling in King v. Burwell to conclude that the government's interpretation of the final rule implementing the premium tax credit provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act should be given deference. On July 28, 2014, Judge Gregory was part of the Fourth Circuit's majority decision that ruled 2-1 in Bostic v. Schaefer to strike down Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage as ``impermissibly infring[ing] on its citizens' fundamental right to marry.'' The Supreme Court eventually affirmed the ruling in King v. Burwell and denied a writ of certiorari in Bostic v. Schaefer, letting that decision stand. Judge Gregory's legal stewardship was displayed in the case of Henry v. Purnell, an important case about excessive force by police and qualified immunity In the original three-judge panel opinion, he filed a dissenting opinion. But when the case was heard en banc, before all the judges of the Fourth Circuit, Judge Gregory amassed a wide 10-3 majority of the court to support his position and hold that the use of force was objectively unreasonable. Judge Gregory's reasoning in his Fourth Circuit dissents was also the basis of two U.S. Supreme Court's majority decisions. One case that reversed a Truth-in-Lending Act decision in the Koons Buick Pontiac v. Nigh (2004) and another that approved Judge Gregory's approach in FEC v. Beaumont (2003). Equally remarkable is Judge Gregory's personal story and professional successes. Roger Gregory was born in Philadelphia, but was adopted by a family and raised in the ``Heights'' section of Petersburg, Virginia. On reflecting on his parents, Judge Gregory said ``I think about my parents. They worked in a tobacco factory and had very little formal education. They got up early and worked more time to earn wages so I could learn my letters.'' Judge Gregory ``learned his letters'' and then some. He attended segregated schools until the eleventh grade and became the first person in his family to graduate from high school. He graduated summa cum laude from Virginia State University and earned a law degree from the University of Michigan in 1978. He also holds honorary degrees from Virginia Union University, Virginia State University, Virginia Commonwealth University, Widener University and Saint Paul's College. After a stint at corporate law firms, he formed the law firm of Wilder & Gregory with former Virginia Governor L. Douglas Wilder. He practiced law at Wilder & Gregory and served as managing partner and head of the litigation section of the firm until his appointment to the Fourth Circuit in 2000. Judge Gregory is widely admired and respected by his colleagues on the bench and in the Virginia Bar. He has supported numerous charitable, legal, and educational organizations and currently serves on the board of trustees of the University of Richmond and the John Marshall Foundation. Judge Gregory is a past rector and member of the Board of Visitors of Virginia Commonwealth University and served on the Board of Visitors of Virginia State University, where he taught as an adjunct professor of Constitutional Law. Judge Gregory is an active member of Good Shepherd Baptist Church, in Petersburg, Virginia, where he serves as Artistic Director of the Drama Ministry. He is a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity and the Alpha Beta Boule of the Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity. The appointment of Roger Gregory as Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit will be celebrated by many who value the wisdom of a wise jurist who holds the deepest respect for the U.S. Constitution. This honor is celebrated especially by his wife Velda Edwards Gregory; his daughters Adriene, Rachel and Christina; and Kai, his only granddaughter and the ``apple of [his] eye.'' Mr. Speaker, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Judge Gregory. The people of the Fourth Circuit should be reassured that they have a defender of justice and fairness.

president george w. bush, with the support of senator john warner and newly elected senator george allen, and confirmed by the u.s. senate on july 20, 2001. during the past 15 years on the bench, judge gregory has developed a reputation as a distinguished and brilliant jurist. he is seen as a leader in forging consensus in the fourth circuit and providing legal analysis that has helped to evolve the thinking of the court. judge gregory was on the panel of judges that heard two groundbreaking cases that were eventually heard by the u.s. supreme court. in 2014, judge gregory was part of the fourth circuit's unanimous ruling in king v. burwell to conclude that the government's interpretation of the final rule implementing the premium tax credit provision of the patient protection and affordable care act should be given deference. on july 28, 2014, judge gregory was part of the fourth circuit's majority decision that ruled 2-1 in bostic v. schaefer to strike down virginia's ban on same-sex marriage as ``impermissibly infring[ing] on its citizens' fundamental right to marry.'' the supreme court eventually affirmed the ruling in king v. burwell and denied a writ of certiorari in bostic v. schaefer, letting that decision stand. judge gregory's legal stewardship was displayed in the case of henry v. purnell, an important case about excessive force by police and qualified immunity in the original three-judge panel opinion, he filed a dissenting opinion. but when the case was heard en banc, before all the judges of the fourth circuit, judge gregory amassed a wide 10-3 majority of the court to support his position and hold that the use of force was objectively unreasonable. judge gregory's reasoning in his fourth circuit dissents was also the basis of two u.s. supreme court's majority decisions. one case that reversed a truth-in-lending act decision in the koons buick pontiac v. nigh (2004) and another that approved judge gregory's approach in fec v. beaumont (2003). equally remarkable is judge gregory's personal story and professional successes. roger gregory was born in philadelphia, but was adopted by a family and raised in the ``heights'' section of petersburg, virginia. on reflecting on his parents, judge gregory said ``i think about my parents. they worked in a tobacco factory and had very little formal education. they got up early and worked more time to earn wages so i could learn my letters.'' judge gregory ``learned his letters'' and then some. he attended segregated schools until the eleventh grade and became the first person in his family to graduate from high school. he graduated summa cum laude from virginia state university and earned a law degree from the university of michigan in 1978. he also holds honorary degrees from virginia union university, virginia state university, virginia commonwealth university, widener university and saint paul's college. after a stint at corporate law firms, he formed the law firm of wilder & gregory with former virginia governor l. douglas wilder. he practiced law at wilder & gregory and served as managing partner and head of the litigation section of the firm until his appointment to the fourth circuit in 2000. judge gregory is widely admired and respected by his colleagues on the bench and in the virginia bar. he has supported numerous charitable, legal, and educational organizations and currently serves on the board of trustees of the university of richmond and the john marshall foundation. judge gregory is a past rector and member of the board of visitors of virginia commonwealth university and served on the board of visitors of virginia state university, where he taught as an adjunct professor of constitutional law. judge gregory is an active member of good shepherd baptist church, in petersburg, virginia, where he serves as artistic director of the drama ministry. he is a member of omega psi phi fraternity and the alpha beta boule of the sigma pi phi fraternity. the appointment of roger gregory as chief judge of the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit will be celebrated by many who value the wisdom of a wise jurist who holds the deepest respect for the u.s. constitution. this honor is celebrated especially by his wife velda edwards gregory; his daughters adriene, rachel and christina; and kai, his only granddaughter and the ``apple of [his] eye.'' mr. speaker, i offer my heartfelt congratulations to judge gregory. the people of the fourth circuit should be reassured that they have a defender of justice and fairness.

TODD C. YOUNG of indiana in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my hometown community in Bloomington, Indiana, and the many Hoosiers who crossed paths with legendary track coach, Sam Bell. It's difficult to estimate just how many Hoosiers it is I speak for today, but suffice it to say, Coach Bell had a tremendous impact in his three decades coaching at Indiana University. It would take all of the time allotted here and then some, to try to list all of Coach Bell's accomplishments. But among the brightest in his long line of successes, was being a father of four, a grandfather to nine, and a source of confidence for so many young people that he coached. Sam Bell remains one of the most highly-regarded coaches in the history of Indiana track and field--and for good reason. He won hundreds of titles. He coached Olympians. He commanded a reputation for greatness which preceded him everywhere he went. His athletes will be the first to tell you Coach Bell was intensely demanding. He was tough--some say old school or conservative even. But they respected him for it. I was especially struck, Mr. Speaker, by one former Olympian who, years later, finds himself constantly quoting Coach Bell to his own children. You see, because of the type of person Coach Bell was, he had the ability to transform not just a single athlete's life, but the lives of those who come thereafter. There is perhaps no greater legacy one can leave, and I am privileged to share it here today--and offer my respects to the Bell family and all who called him ``Coach.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1073] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING INDIANA UNIVERSITY TRACK COACH SAM BELL ______ HON.

The Citizen's Police Advisory Board acts as a liaison to strengthen relationships between the citizens of Council Bluffs and the local Police Department. Bob has served on the Advisory Board for over 30 years. When Bob retired in 1984 from the U.S. Army he knew he wanted to do something for his community. He became a member of the Citizen's Police Advisory Board because it had a history of loyalty and structure similar to the U.S. Army. He served five different police chiefs while serving on the Advisory Board. Mr. Wege said he could remember something that President Lyndon Johnson had said, ``Law enforcement cannot succeed without the sustained and informed interest of all citizens.'' When he read this statement, Bob knew this was something he could do for his community. Bob was raised in Norfolk, Nebraska and attended Norfolk High School. There he met his future wife, Mary Ann, and they married in 1948. Bob joined the U.S. Army later that year and spent the next 36 years serving our country. Bob has not asked for any special recognition but has been motivated by his desire to serve his nation and his community. I commend and congratulate Bob Wege for his service to our country and his commitment and dedication to Council Bluffs, Iowa. I am proud to represent him in the United States Congress. I know that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives join me in congratulating Bob Wege for his service and wish him the very best in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1073] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO ROBERT ``BOB'' WEGE ______ HON.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge Mark McCartney, the Master Police Officer of the Leesburg Police Department, for his many years of service to the community of Loudoun County. Mr. McCartney has been a part of the Leesburg Police since August 1986, and his many years of service have been hallmarked with distinctions worthy of such a dedicated officer who will soon be retiring exactly 30 years after he first started. Mark began his police training in 1985 when he was enrolled in the Municipal Police Academy of the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and then subsequently attended the 64th session of the Northern Virginia Criminal Justice Academy. He served the following 10 years as a patrol officer before being promoted to the rank of corporal in 1989. He was furthermore a motorcycle officer for 18 years during which he investigated countless road accidents, and was a member of the Crash Reconstruction Unit. More notably still, Officer McCartney also acted as the sniper for the Special Operations Team, whilst also returning to the North Virginia Criminal Justice Academy as a radar instructor. He was decorated as Master Police Officer in 2003. Officer McCartney has gone beyond his duty throughout his years of service as evidenced by his exemplary record, and this record has not gone unseen. Indeed, Mark McCartney has been honored with multiple awards throughout his career including that of Officer of the Year, the Loudoun County Chamber Life Saving Award, and of course the Leesburg Police Outstanding Service Award. This is a man who deserves all our thanks and gratitude for all that he has done for our community. Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to congratulate Officer McCartney for his service, and to join me in wishing him a happiness and fortune in his future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1073] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF MARK McCARTNEY OF THE LEESBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT ______ HON.

Mark began his police training in 1985 when he was enrolled in the Municipal Police Academy of the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and then subsequently attended the 64th session of the Northern Virginia Criminal Justice Academy. He served the following 10 years as a patrol officer before being promoted to the rank of corporal in 1989. He was furthermore a motorcycle officer for 18 years during which he investigated countless road accidents, and was a member of the Crash Reconstruction Unit. More notably still, Officer McCartney also acted as the sniper for the Special Operations Team, whilst also returning to the North Virginia Criminal Justice Academy as a radar instructor. He was decorated as Master Police Officer in 2003. Officer McCartney has gone beyond his duty throughout his years of service as evidenced by his exemplary record, and this record has not gone unseen. Indeed, Mark McCartney has been honored with multiple awards throughout his career including that of Officer of the Year, the Loudoun County Chamber Life Saving Award, and of course the Leesburg Police Outstanding Service Award. This is a man who deserves all our thanks and gratitude for all that he has done for our community. Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to congratulate Officer McCartney for his service, and to join me in wishing him a happiness and fortune in his future endeavors. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1073] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF MARK McCARTNEY OF THE LEESBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT ______ HON.

CREC-2016-07-08-pt1-PgE1074,CREC-2016-07-08,114,REMEMBERING ROMERO: GOD PASSED THROUGH EL SALVADOR,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1074-E1075] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING ROMERO: GOD PASSED THROUGH EL SALVADOR ______ HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN of massachusetts in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, in the Spring 2016 edition of ReVista Magazine, Gene Palumbo has written a beautiful remembrance of Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was assassinated in 1980 and recently beatified in May 2015 in a moving ceremony that I was privileged to attend. I have known Gene Palumbo for over three decades. He first began reporting on the war in El Salvador in 1980, when he moved to El Salvador to continue covering the civil war over the next twelve years. I remember speaking to him frequently when I traveled to El Salvador during those turbulent times, and I have always valued his insights and knowledge of the people, institutions and internal dynamics of that country. Gene has reported for the New York Times, National Public Radio, the Canadian Broadcasting Company, and most frequently, for the National Catholic Reporter. He teaches at the Casa de la Solidaridad, a semester-long study abroad program for U.S. university students in San Salvador. Gene's reporting continues to inform and inspire me. This moving tribute to Archbishop Romero reflects the hope Gene continues to have in El Salvador's future. I urge all my colleagues to read and reflect on the life of the martyred and blessed Oscar Romero and the dedication of Gene Palumbo, who continues to write about the challenges facing the Salvadoran people. Remembering Romero: ``God Passed Through El Salvador'' (By Gene Palumbo) San Salvador.--Fr. Paul Schindler remembers the day when Oscar Romero sat beside him, trembling. Romero knew he wasn't among friends. The scene was a clergy meeting in early 1977, and many of the priests were furious: a man they'd clashed with--Romero--had just been named as the new archbishop. As the meeting was ending, Romero--who hadn't yet been installed--was asked if he'd like to say a few words. For all Schindler knew, they would be the last words he'd ever hear from Romero. Discouraged at the prospect of working under someone he was unsure of, Schindler had told his bishop back in Cleveland that he'd decided to return home after eight years of parish work in El Salvador. ``He walked to the front of the room and began to speak,'' said Schindler, ``and after a half hour, I said to myself, `I'm not going anywhere.' '' It was Schindler's first glimpse of something that, until then, had been unknown to him and many others: Romero had begun to change. Earlier, in his years as an auxiliary bishop in San Salvador, many had regarded him as too docile, too accepting of a social order which, they felt, cried out for change. Then, in 1974, he was named bishop of Santiago de Maria, a rural diocese where government repression was widespread, and where, while Romero was bishop, the first massacres of peasants took place. His three years there affected him deeply. Those were the years when Eva Menjivar came to know him. She was one of many nuns who, in the 1960s, left their convents in San Salvador and went to work in rural parishes that had no priests. She was assigned to Ciudad Barrios, the small town in eastern El Salvador where Romero was born and grew up. The town was located in the Santiago de Maria diocese, and by the time Romero was named bishop there, Menjivar and her fellow sisters had catechetical and literacy programs underway, and were offering job training in sewing and auto mechanics. Menjivar says that when people invited Romero to visit their far-flung hamlets, he almost always accepted. She recalls an occasion when residents of one of those hamlets staged a play for him, a play they had written about several Gospel parables. Afterward, they spoke about what the parables meant to them. At the end they turned to Romero and--as one might ask an expert--said, tell us what these parables really mean. His reply, Menjivar recalls, was, ``I have nothing to add. I've learned more about the Bible today than I did when I studied it in the seminary in Rome.'' ``We had never seen a bishop draw near to the people the way he did,'' says Menjivar. ``He'd greet them all, try to speak with them all, and when they had questions for him, he was happy to try to answer them.'' Schindler's experience was similar. ``Whenever I'd invite him--and not just to the main church, but to the rural villages--he would come. He was always there with the people. That was his whole thing: to walk with them, to feel with them, to inspire them.'' Menjivar recalls the sisters' monthly retreats with Romero, and the time in late 1976 when, informed that the National Guard had arrested two teenage catechists in Ciudad Barrios, he went there immediately to demand their release. To ensure that they wouldn't be re-arrested, he took them back to Santiago de Maria where he listened to their accounts of being tortured. Menjivar was later transferred to a parish near the town of Aguilares. There she worked with Jesuit Fr. Rutilio Grande, whose sainthood process is now underway. On the evening of March 12, 1977, she was at Mass when she was handed a note saying that Grande had disappeared. She went straight to Aguilares and, upon arriving, learned that he had been murdered along with an elderly campesino and a teenager. Grande and Romero had become close friends in the late 1960s, when both were living at the seminary in San Salvador. When Romero was named bishop in 1970, he asked Grande to preside at his installation ceremony. In the following four years--up until the time he left for Santiago de Maria--Romero had bitter disputes with priests in the archdiocese, and when, to their dismay, he was named archbishop in 1977, it was Grande who stood up for him. ``Rutilio said to us, `Yes, he's conservative. But he's honest, and he's someone you can work with' '' said Fr. Pedro Declercq, a Belgian missionary whose work with grass-roots Christian communities led to the bombing of his parish. Declercq didn't have to wait long to see how much Romero had changed. They'd had an ugly falling out in 1972, when his parishioners invited Romero to visit them to say Mass and explain why he had justified, on behalf of the bishops conference, a military invasion of the National University. The army had wounded some people, arrested others, and evicted people whose homes were on the university's campus. The discussion between Romero and the parishioners began at the homily, but quickly turned into a shouting match, with Declercq finally tearing off his vestments and saying the Mass was over. When Romero returned to San Salvador as archbishop, he visited the parish again. As recounted by Sister Noemi Ortiz in Maria Lopez Vigil's Monsenor Romero: Memories in Mosaic, [Romero] brought up [the earlier incident] as soon as he got there. ``We couldn't even celebrate the Eucharist that afternoon . . . We were insulting each other. . . . Do you remember? I remember it well and today, as your pastor, I want to say that I now understand what happened that day, and here before you I recognize my error. ``I was wrong and you were right. That day you taught me about faith and about the Church. Please forgive me for everything that happened then.'' Well, all of us, young and old, started crying . . . We broke into applause, and our applause melted into the music of the party. . . . All was forgiven. On the night of Grande's death, Menjivar was sitting beside his corpse, using a towel to absorb the blood that was trickling out, when Romero arrived at the parish. She said Romero approached the corpse and, after standing in silence for several moments, said, ``If we don't change now, we never will.'' Jesuit Fr. Jon Sobrino, a prominent liberation theologian, was at the parish that night, and answered the door when Romero knocked. Earlier Romero had criticized Sobrino's writings on Christology; later, as archbishop, he would consult Sobrino when preparing his pastoral letters. Sobrino says that after Romero himself was murdered, ``people began speaking of him as an exceptional person and Christian. In the funeral Mass we held for him at the UCA (Central American University), Ignacio Ellacuria said, `In Archbishop Romero, God passed through El Salvador' The people spontaneously proclaimed him a saint'' (In 1989, Fr. Ellacuria, along with five other Jesuits and two women, was murdered at the UCA.) When Pope Francis ratified Romero's status as a martyr, Schindler said, ``The people in the parish have been waiting and waiting for this. They hold him as a saint, and they've always held him as a saint, and now that the pronouncement has been made, they're going to be overwhelmed.'' Menjivar said that when she heard the news, ``I felt great joy--and at the same time, I thought to myself, I hope this will be the occasion for those who killed him to be converted.''

On the night of Grande's death, Menjivar was sitting beside his corpse, using a towel to absorb the blood that was trickling out, when Romero arrived at the parish. She said Romero approached the corpse and, after standing in silence for several moments, said, ``If we don't change now, we never will.'' Jesuit Fr. Jon Sobrino, a prominent liberation theologian, was at the parish that night, and answered the door when Romero knocked. Earlier Romero had criticized Sobrino's writings on Christology; later, as archbishop, he would consult Sobrino when preparing his pastoral letters. Sobrino says that after Romero himself was murdered, ``people began speaking of him as an exceptional person and Christian. In the funeral Mass we held for him at the UCA (Central American University), Ignacio Ellacuria said, `In Archbishop Romero, God passed through El Salvador' The people spontaneously proclaimed him a saint'' (In 1989, Fr. Ellacuria, along with five other Jesuits and two women, was murdered at the UCA.) When Pope Francis ratified Romero's status as a martyr, Schindler said, ``The people in the parish have been waiting and waiting for this. They hold him as a saint, and they've always held him as a saint, and now that the pronouncement has been made, they're going to be overwhelmed.'' Menjivar said that when she heard the news, ``I felt great joy--and at the same time, I thought to myself, I hope this will be the occasion for those who killed him to be converted.''

JAMES P. McGOVERN of massachusetts in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, in the Spring 2016 edition of ReVista Magazine, Gene Palumbo has written a beautiful remembrance of Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was assassinated in 1980 and recently beatified in May 2015 in a moving ceremony that I was privileged to attend. I have known Gene Palumbo for over three decades. He first began reporting on the war in El Salvador in 1980, when he moved to El Salvador to continue covering the civil war over the next twelve years. I remember speaking to him frequently when I traveled to El Salvador during those turbulent times, and I have always valued his insights and knowledge of the people, institutions and internal dynamics of that country. Gene has reported for the New York Times, National Public Radio, the Canadian Broadcasting Company, and most frequently, for the National Catholic Reporter. He teaches at the Casa de la Solidaridad, a semester-long study abroad program for U.S. university students in San Salvador. Gene's reporting continues to inform and inspire me. This moving tribute to Archbishop Romero reflects the hope Gene continues to have in El Salvador's future. I urge all my colleagues to read and reflect on the life of the martyred and blessed Oscar Romero and the dedication of Gene Palumbo, who continues to write about the challenges facing the Salvadoran people. Remembering Romero: ``God Passed Through El Salvador'' (By Gene Palumbo) San Salvador.--Fr. Paul Schindler remembers the day when Oscar Romero sat beside him, trembling. Romero knew he wasn't among friends. The scene was a clergy meeting in early 1977, and many of the priests were furious: a man they'd clashed with--Romero--had just been named as the new archbishop. As the meeting was ending, Romero--who hadn't yet been installed--was asked if he'd like to say a few words. For all Schindler knew, they would be the last words he'd ever hear from Romero. Discouraged at the prospect of working under someone he was unsure of, Schindler had told his bishop back in Cleveland that he'd decided to return home after eight years of parish work in El Salvador. ``He walked to the front of the room and began to speak,'' said Schindler, ``and after a half hour, I said to myself, `I'm not going anywhere.' '' It was Schindler's first glimpse of something that, until then, had been unknown to him and many others: Romero had begun to change. Earlier, in his years as an auxiliary bishop in San Salvador, many had regarded him as too docile, too accepting of a social order which, they felt, cried out for change. Then, in 1974, he was named bishop of Santiago de Maria, a rural diocese where government repression was widespread, and where, while Romero was bishop, the first massacres of peasants took place. His three years there affected him deeply. Those were the years when Eva Menjivar came to know him. She was one of many nuns who, in the 1960s, left their convents in San Salvador and went to work in rural parishes that had no priests. She was assigned to Ciudad Barrios, the small town in eastern El Salvador where Romero was born and grew up. The town was located in the Santiago de Maria diocese, and by the time Romero was named bishop there, Menjivar and her fellow sisters had catechetical and literacy programs underway, and were offering job training in sewing and auto mechanics. Menjivar says that when people invited Romero to visit their far-flung hamlets, he almost always accepted. She recalls an occasion when residents of one of those hamlets staged a play for him, a play they had written about several Gospel parables. Afterward, they spoke about what the parables meant to them. At the end they turned to Romero and--as one might ask an expert--said, tell us what these parables really mean. His reply, Menjivar recalls, was, ``I have nothing to add. I've learned more about the Bible today than I did when I studied it in the seminary in Rome.'' ``We had never seen a bishop draw near to the people the way he did,'' says Menjivar. ``He'd greet them all, try to speak with them all, and when they had questions for him, he was happy to try to answer them.'' Schindler's experience was similar. ``Whenever I'd invite him--and not just to the main church, but to the rural villages--he would come. He was always there with the people. That was his whole thing: to walk with them, to feel with them, to inspire them.'' Menjivar recalls the sisters' monthly retreats with Romero, and the time in late 1976 when, informed that the National Guard had arrested two teenage catechists in Ciudad Barrios, he went there immediately to demand their release. To ensure that they wouldn't be re-arrested, he took them back to Santiago de Maria where he listened to their accounts of being tortured. Menjivar was later transferred to a parish near the town of Aguilares. There she worked with Jesuit Fr. Rutilio Grande, whose sainthood process is now underway. On the evening of March 12, 1977, she was at Mass when she was handed a note saying that Grande had disappeared. She went straight to Aguilares and, upon arriving, learned that he had been murdered along with an elderly campesino and a teenager. Grande and Romero had become close friends in the late 1960s, when both were living at the seminary in San Salvador. When Romero was named bishop in 1970, he asked Grande to preside at his installation ceremony. In the following four years--up until the time he left for Santiago de Maria--Romero had bitter disputes with priests in the archdiocese, and when, to their dismay, he was named archbishop in 1977, it was Grande who stood up for him. ``Rutilio said to us, `Yes, he's conservative. But he's honest, and he's someone you can work with' '' said Fr. Pedro Declercq, a Belgian missionary whose work with grass-roots Christian communities led to the bombing of his parish. Declercq didn't have to wait long to see how much Romero had changed. They'd had an ugly falling out in 1972, when his parishioners invited Romero to visit them to say Mass and explain why he had justified, on behalf of the bishops conference, a military invasion of the National University. The army had wounded some people, arrested others, and evicted people whose homes were on the university's campus. The discussion between Romero and the parishioners began at the homily, but quickly turned into a shouting match, with Declercq finally tearing off his vestments and saying the Mass was over. When Romero returned to San Salvador as archbishop, he visited the parish again. As recounted by Sister Noemi Ortiz in Maria Lopez Vigil's Monsenor Romero: Memories in Mosaic, [Romero] brought up [the earlier incident] as soon as he got there. ``We couldn't even celebrate the Eucharist that afternoon . . . We were insulting each other. . . . Do you remember? I remember it well and today, as your pastor, I want to say that I now understand what happened that day, and here before you I recognize my error. ``I was wrong and you were right. That day you taught me about faith and about the Church. Please forgive me for everything that happened then.'' Well, all of us, young and old, started crying . . . We broke into applause, and our applause melted into the music of the party. . . . All was forgiven. On the night of Grande's death, Menjivar was sitting beside his corpse, using a towel to absorb the blood that was trickling out, when Romero arrived at the parish. She said Romero approached the corpse and, after standing in silence for several moments, said, ``If we don't change now, we never will.'' Jesuit Fr. Jon Sobrino, a prominent liberation theologian, was at the parish that night, and answered the door when Romero knocked. Earlier Romero had criticized Sobrino's writings on Christology; later, as archbishop, he would consult Sobrino when preparing his pastoral letters. Sobrino says that after Romero himself was murdered, ``people began speaking of him as an exceptional person and Christian. In the funeral Mass we held for him at the UCA (Central American University), Ignacio Ellacuria said, `In Archbishop Romero, God passed through El Salvador' The people spontaneously proclaimed him a saint'' (In 1989, Fr. Ellacuria, along with five other Jesuits and two women, was murdered at the UCA.) When Pope Francis ratified Romero's status as a martyr, Schindler said, ``The people in the parish have been waiting and waiting for this. They hold him as a saint, and they've always held him as a saint, and now that the pronouncement has been made, they're going to be overwhelmed.'' Menjivar said that when she heard the news, ``I felt great joy--and at the same time, I thought to myself, I hope this will be the occasion for those who killed him to be converted.''

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Rule for this very important reason. I oppose the rule because we should instead be devoting our time, attention, and energy to passing legislation to address the epidemic of gun violence and keeps the most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous persons and potential terrorists. Mr. Speaker, we should instead be debating and voting on ``No Fly, No Buy'' legislation to keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists and H.R. 1217, the ``Public Safety & Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2015,'' sponsored by Congressman Peter King of New York and Congressman Mike Thompson of California, which expands and strengthens the firearms transfer background check system. Less than a month ago, on June 12, our nation was horrified and heartbroken by the heinous act of terror and hatred that claimed the lives of 49 innocent persons and wounded many more in Orlando, Florida, the deadliest mass shooting in the history of our country. Our hearts still grieve over a loss so overwhelming and senseless. Mass shootings have become too common in our country and we owe it to the victims of gun violence--from Orlando to Charleston to Aurora to Chattanooga to Fort Hood and more--to keep weapons intended for military use out of the hands of persons who would use them to massacre civilians. Mr. Speaker, the statistics are grim. In 2015, 13,286 people were killed in the United States by firearms and 26,819 people were injured; In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings in the United States, including 64 school shootings at elementary and secondary schools; More than 700 children have lost their lives to gun violence in the first 160 days of 2015; On average, 7 children and adolescents lose their lives to gun violence each day, 75 percent of which are under the age of 12 years old; So many people die annually from gun violence in the United States that the death toll between 1968 and 2011 eclipses the total lives lost in all the armed conflicts in the history of the United States; Mr. Speaker, let me briefly recount some of the gun violence carnage that claimed the lives of more than 300,000 persons during the period 2005-2015: 1. On June 7, 2015, a gunman shot and killed nine people at the Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, one of the oldest and largest black congregations in the South; 2. On November 11, 2009, at Fort Hood, near Killeen, Texas, a gunman shot and killed 13 people, and wounded 30 others; 3. On August 5, 2012 in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, a gunman shot and killed six people, and injured three others, at the Sikh Temple of Oak Creek; 4. On July 7, 2015 in Chattanooga, Tennessee a gunman shot and killed five people, including two U.S. Marines and a Naval Officer, and shot and injured two others at a recruiting center and U.S. Naval Reserve Center; 5. On December 2, 2015 in San Bernardino, California, two gunmen killed 14 people and injured 21 others at the Inland Regional Center; 6. On December 14, 2012, a gunman murdered 26 persons, including 20 children and 6 school administrators and teachers, at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut; 7. On April 16, 2007, a gunman killed 32 persons and injured 17 others at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Virginia; and 8. On August 8, 2015, a gunman brutally murdered his ex-girlfriend and her six children and husband in one of the most notorious cases of domestic violence in the history of Houston, Texas; Nearly 100 metropolitan areas have experienced mass shootings like these since 2013. Mass shootings occur more frequently in states that do not require background checks for all gun sales and analyses of mass shootings in the United States between 2009 and 2015 document that the majority of mass shootings occur in venues where the carrying of firearms is not restricted. In states that require background checks for all handgun sales, including guns offered in unlicensed sales online and at gun shows, there are 52 percent fewer mass shootings. Congress has observed 25 moments of silence honoring victims of mass shootings since the December 14, 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, but has not enacted or even brought up for debate and vote a single gun violence prevention measure. That is why I have introduced H.R. 5470, the ``Stop Mass Killings by Violent Terrorists Act,'' which will prohibit a firearms dealer from transferring a semiautomatic assault weapon or large capacity ammunition clips to a purchaser until the Attorney General has verified that the prospective transferee has truthfully answered new questions on the firearms background check questionnaire regarding contacts between the prospective purchaser or transferee and federal law enforcement authorities. H.R. 5470 complements many of the gun violence prevention and anti- terrorism bills I have introduced in this and previous Congresses, including the ``No Fly For Foreign Fighters Act'' (H.R. 4240), which passed the House earlier this year and is pending in the Senate. I am pleased that Republican Senator Susan Collins, along with her colleagues Senator Lindsay Graham and others, have introduced bipartisan legislation this week that will ban the sale of guns to anyone who appears on the government's No-Fly list, or the selectee list, a list which includes names of people who require additional security at airports. Clearly, if you're too dangerous to get on a plane, you're too dangerous to buy a gun. On average gun violence claims the lives of 90 persons each day. Since 1968, more than a million persons have died at the hand of a gun. The homicide rate in the United States is about 6.9 times higher than the combined rate in 22 other populous highly-developed countries, despite similar non-lethal crime and violence rates. Mr. Speaker, we can reduce the incidence of mass shootings like the ones that occurred in San Bernardino, Newtown, and Orlando by making it more difficult for those who would do our people and communities harm to obtain automatic assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines more difficult, or better yet, by banning them altogether. And a good place to start is for the House to reject this Rule and bring to the floor for debate and vote H.R. 1217, the Public Safety & Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2015,'' and the bill I have introduced with Congresswoman Corrine Brown, whose congressional district includes Orlando's Pulse Nightclub, H.R. 5470, the ``Stop Mass Killings by Violent Terrorists Act.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1075] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN OPPOSITION TO RULE ON MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON S. 2943, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 AND CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. 524, COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2016 ______ HON.

On July 7, 2015 in Chattanooga, Tennessee a gunman shot and killed five people, including two U.S. Marines and a Naval Officer, and shot and injured two others at a recruiting center and U.S. Naval Reserve Center; 5. On December 2, 2015 in San Bernardino, California, two gunmen killed 14 people and injured 21 others at the Inland Regional Center; 6. On December 14, 2012, a gunman murdered 26 persons, including 20 children and 6 school administrators and teachers, at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut; 7. On April 16, 2007, a gunman killed 32 persons and injured 17 others at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Virginia; and 8. On August 8, 2015, a gunman brutally murdered his ex-girlfriend and her six children and husband in one of the most notorious cases of domestic violence in the history of Houston, Texas; Nearly 100 metropolitan areas have experienced mass shootings like these since 2013. Mass shootings occur more frequently in states that do not require background checks for all gun sales and analyses of mass shootings in the United States between 2009 and 2015 document that the majority of mass shootings occur in venues where the carrying of firearms is not restricted. In states that require background checks for all handgun sales, including guns offered in unlicensed sales online and at gun shows, there are 52 percent fewer mass shootings. Congress has observed 25 moments of silence honoring victims of mass shootings since the December 14, 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, but has not enacted or even brought up for debate and vote a single gun violence prevention measure. That is why I have introduced H.R. 5470, the ``Stop Mass Killings by Violent Terrorists Act,'' which will prohibit a firearms dealer from transferring a semiautomatic assault weapon or large capacity ammunition clips to a purchaser until the Attorney General has verified that the prospective transferee has truthfully answered new questions on the firearms background check questionnaire regarding contacts between the prospective purchaser or transferee and federal law enforcement authorities. H.R. 5470 complements many of the gun violence prevention and anti- terrorism bills I have introduced in this and previous Congresses, including the ``No Fly For Foreign Fighters Act'' (H.R. 4240), which passed the House earlier this year and is pending in the Senate. I am pleased that Republican Senator Susan Collins, along with her colleagues Senator Lindsay Graham and others, have introduced bipartisan legislation this week that will ban the sale of guns to anyone who appears on the government's No-Fly list, or the selectee list, a list which includes names of people who require additional security at airports. Clearly, if you're too dangerous to get on a plane, you're too dangerous to buy a gun. On average gun violence claims the lives of 90 persons each day. Since 1968, more than a million persons have died at the hand of a gun. The homicide rate in the United States is about 6.9 times higher than the combined rate in 22 other populous highly-developed countries, despite similar non-lethal crime and violence rates. Mr. Speaker, we can reduce the incidence of mass shootings like the ones that occurred in San Bernardino, Newtown, and Orlando by making it more difficult for those who would do our people and communities harm to obtain automatic assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines more difficult, or better yet, by banning them altogether. And a good place to start is for the House to reject this Rule and bring to the floor for debate and vote H.R. 1217, the Public Safety & Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2015,'' and the bill I have introduced with Congresswoman Corrine Brown, whose congressional district includes Orlando's Pulse Nightclub, H.R. 5470, the ``Stop Mass Killings by Violent Terrorists Act.'' ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1075] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN OPPOSITION TO RULE ON MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON S. 2943, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 AND CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. 524, COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2016 ______ HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Rule for this very important reason. I oppose the rule because we should instead be devoting our time, attention, and energy to passing legislation to address the epidemic of gun violence and keeps the most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous persons and potential terrorists. Mr. Speaker, we should instead be debating and voting on ``No Fly, No Buy'' legislation to keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists and H.R. 1217, the ``Public Safety & Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2015,'' sponsored by Congressman Peter King of New York and Congressman Mike Thompson of California, which expands and strengthens the firearms transfer background check system. Less than a month ago, on June 12, our nation was horrified and heartbroken by the heinous act of terror and hatred that claimed the lives of 49 innocent persons and wounded many more in Orlando, Florida, the deadliest mass shooting in the history of our country. Our hearts still grieve over a loss so overwhelming and senseless. Mass shootings have become too common in our country and we owe it to the victims of gun violence--from Orlando to Charleston to Aurora to Chattanooga to Fort Hood and more--to keep weapons intended for military use out of the hands of persons who would use them to massacre civilians. Mr. Speaker, the statistics are grim. In 2015, 13,286 people were killed in the United States by firearms and 26,819 people were injured; In 2015 there were 372 mass shootings in the United States, including 64 school shootings at elementary and secondary schools; More than 700 children have lost their lives to gun violence in the first 160 days of 2015; On average, 7 children and adolescents lose their lives to gun violence each day, 75 percent of which are under the age of 12 years old; So many people die annually from gun violence in the United States that the death toll between 1968 and 2011 eclipses the total lives lost in all the armed conflicts in the history of the United States; Mr. Speaker, let me briefly recount some of the gun violence carnage that claimed the lives of more than 300,000 persons during the period 2005-2015: 1. On June 7, 2015, a gunman shot and killed nine people at the Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, one of the oldest and largest black congregations in the South; 2. On November 11, 2009, at Fort Hood, near Killeen, Texas, a gunman shot and killed 13 people, and wounded 30 others; 3.

JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the grand opening of the Fresno [[Page E1076]] County Historical Museum, an expansion of the award-winning Big Fresno Fair Museum. The Fresno County Historical Museum will provide the opportunity for many individuals to learn about the diverse and rich history of Fresno County. The first phase of the Fresno County Historical Museum was initially opened to the public during the 2015 Big Fresno Fair, and will be expanded to include an additional 7,000 square feet of exhibit space. This space will serve to highlight historical items in both permanent and temporary displays from the Fresno Police Department, Fresno Fire Department, Fresno Athletic Hall of Fame, Sheriff's Office, Fresno Historical Society, Legion of Valor, the Fresno County Farm Bureau, and many more. The Fresno County Historical Museum is one of the largest capital improvement projects in years at the Fresno Fair Grounds. It will reflect the diverse communities that call Fresno County home by commemorating Mono Indian, Armenian, and Japanese American histories and the positive impact they have had on our county. Displays will pay tribute to the famed inhabitants of our county through photography, artifacts, and memorabilia. For example, the museum will provide the first permanent venue for the Fresno Athletic Hall of Fame that will showcase photos and sports memorabilia of its 300 inductees, including the late beloved coach Jerry Tarkanian, U.S. Olympic softball medalist Laura Berg, and Major League Baseball player Frank LeRoy Chance. In addition, other exhibits are planned to honor notable members of Fresno County, including the famed Oscar and Pulitzer-prize winning author, William Saroyan. The Fresno County Historical Museum is a place for the community to learn more about the county's past, and to further appreciate what makes Fresno County the great place it is. It is an honor to celebrate this momentous occasion with the Big Fresno Fair Board of Directors, The Fresno County Historical Society, and the community members through Fresno County who have made this museum a reality. Without the unwavering commitment of these individuals, projects and facilities such as the Fresno County Historical Museum would not be possible. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in recognizing the Fresno County Historical Museum expansion to the Big Fresno Fair Museum. This museum will allow the residents of Fresno County to learn and appreciate the rich history of our Valley for many generations to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1075-E1076] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE EXPANSION OF THE FRESNO COUNTY HISTORICAL MUSEUM ______ HON.

STEVEN M. PALAZZO of mississippi in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Major General Augustus L. Collins, the adjutant general of Mississippi, for his service to the Mississippi National Guard. General Collins announced his retirement July 5, 2016 and will be succeeded by Brigadier Gen. Janson D. Boyles on September 1, 2016. Currently overseeing the Mississippi Military Department and serving as the commander of the Mississippi Army and Air National Guard, Collins will retire his time in uniform after 35 years of loyal service to Mississippi and the United States. A Booneville, Mississippi native, General Collins was appointed as the adjutant general on January 11, 2012, by Governor Phil Bryant and is in charge of 12,275 Citizen Soldiers and Airmen. Collins' career began in March 1977 as a private with the Mississippi Army National Guard's Company B, 1st Battalion, 198th Armor Regiment. Several years later, in 1980, General Collins completed Officer Candidate School and served in command and staff positions on the company, battalion, and brigade levels. He also served on the adjutant general's primary staff as a traditional and active Guard--Reserve Soldier. General Collins served on active duty in Operations Desert Shield and Storm, and commanded the 155th Armored Brigade Combat Team during Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2004-2006. This was the largest mobilization of troops from Mississippi since World War II. Collins was then promoted to brigadier general in May of 2005 in Iraq. In 2012, he was then appointed to his current position of adjutant general. Collins is a distinct and resilient leader that has worked alongside many soldiers, airmen and civilians. I thank him for his dedication to Mississippi and America over the last 35 years. He is an inductee into the University of Mississippi Alumni Hall of Fame and a 2006 inductee into the Mississippi Military Academy Officer Candidate School Hall of Fame. He is a highly decorated official, having earned prestigious awards from Mississippi as well as numerous nationally recognized awards. General Collins has an incomparable record of leadership and I sincerely appreciate his long-standing efforts to protect the state and people of Mississippi. I would like to extend by best wishes to Major General Augustus L. Collins upon his retirement from the Mississippi National Guard and future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1076] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADJUTANT GENERAL COLLINS OF MISSISSIPPI ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT ______ HON.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Friday, July 8, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge HeroHomes, a nonprofit organization in my district dedicated to providing veterans who have heroically served our country the satisfaction of owning their own homes, a solid foundation for a successful future, and the pride that comes with living independently. With all of the sacrifices that our veterans make preserving freedom and democracy for others, I can think of few causes that are nobler than helping these returning heroes reenter civilian life. Recently, HeroHomes was able to provide a new home for its first disabled veteran, Tony Porta. Tony was an Apache Helicopter pilot with over 2,500 hours of flight time from over 20 years of service, and had five tours of duty in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, in the process of carrying out his duties, he suffered a severe spinal injury and subsequently spent over two and a half years in the hospital while also suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD. Tony has more than fulfilled his duty and has sacrificed much for the sake of his country, and HeroHomes was there for him in his time of need. Their altruism is beyond measure and the institution has more than lived up to its motto ``building houses, jobs, and community for those who have fought for the preservation of freedom and democracy for others''. Following the sentiments of the organization's founder, Jason Brownell, HeroHomes not only assists in providing homes for these brave veterans, but also settles them into a small town community setting. This foundation not only embodies charity and selflessness, but has helped to inspire it; with members of the community and local builders having volunteered to help make this initiative a reality. Mr. Speaker, the good men and women that make up this institution exemplify a spirit of comradery that makes America truly great. I would encourage my colleagues to join me in thanking all of our servicemen and women that have sacrificed much in defense of our nation, and HeroHomes for their impassioned care of our heroes when they return home. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 110 (Friday, July 8, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1076] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF HEROHOMES ______ HON.
