CREC-2016-07-15-pt1-PgE1139-3,CREC-2016-07-15,114,GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA: STOPPING THE BLOODSHED,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1139] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA: STOPPING THE BLOODSHED ______ HON. JOYCE BEATTY of ohio in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I am shocked and devastated by the multiple, tragic deaths occurring across our country. The most recent senseless deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile at the hands of police and the equally senseless killing of five Dallas police officers were all completely avoidable and intolerable. Words alone cannot describe my heartbreak--nor can words alone bring resolve. Mr. Speaker, our resolve should be real solutions to stop the bloodshed. Enough is enough--the American people are fed up, Congressional Democrats are fed up, the Congressional Black Caucus is fed up, and I am fed up. Republican Leadership should immediately bring to the floor: 1. The Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act, H.R. 1217, which would expand the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales. 2. Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, H.R. 1076, also known as ``No Fly, No Buy,'' which would allow the FBI to block gun sales to people on the terrorist watch list. 3. Background Check Completion Act, H.R. 3051, which would require that a background check be completed before any gun sale proceeds, and 4. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, H.R. 4603, which would ban the sale of firearms to those convicted of assaulting someone based on their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. Mr. Speaker, we continue to mourn the loss of lives in Newtown, Aurora, Charleston, Orlando, and so many others. Last month, House Democrats, led by our CBC colleague and iconic civil rights leader Congressman John Lewis from the 5th district of Georgia, held a 26-hour sit-in on the Floor of the House of Representatives to demand House Republican Leaders hold a vote on legislation to address gun violence. Mr. Speaker, after this sit-in, voters will not be silent. Americans across the country are coming together and organizing. In my district, I led a conference call with diverse leaders, activists, elected officials, religious and civic organizations, businesses and individuals in Central Ohio to discuss paving the way forward to curb gun violence and to unite our community. Mr. Speaker, we're not asking for a lot--we are simply asking to save lives. Mr. Speaker, what will it take? Our former colleague, U.S. House Representative Gabrielle Gifford, resigned due to being gun downed while trying to represent her constituents to the fullest. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., ``We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now.'' Mr. Speaker, it is time you heed those words. Our nation is in an urgent crisis, yet, we remain trapped in Congressional inaction. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1139] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA: STOPPING THE BLOODSHED ______ HON.

MIKE THOMPSON of california in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Senator Lois Wolk upon her retirement from the California State Senate. Senator Wolk has lived in Davis, California since 1978, and began her career in public service in 1990 when she was elected to the Davis City Council. During her service as a councilmember, Senator Wolk prioritized initiatives that improved environmental sustainability and expanded access to health services for the people of Davis, including leading the efforts to restore and preserve Putah Creek and to build Sutter Davis Hospital. Senator Wolk was elected to serve as a Yolo County Supervisor in 1998, and while serving on the board of Supervisors she spearheaded efforts to improve children's welfare. The culmination of those efforts was the creation of Multi-Disciplinary Interview Center for abused children, a Crisis Nursery, and a new Juvenile Hall. Given the importance of agriculture to Yolo County's economy, Senator Wolk led a major revision of the county's Agricultural Zoning Ordinance as a supervisor to preserve the county's land quality for generations to come. After her service as County Supervisor, Senator Wolk was elected to the California State Assembly for three consecutive terms, serving from 2002 until 2008. She became the first woman to chair the Assembly Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee, where she advanced legislation addressing flood protection, the crisis in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and climate change. Senator Wolk was elected to the California State Senate in 2008. As a senator, she has introduced and advanced legislation related to environmental protections and social equality. She also spearheaded the creation of a statewide registry to ensure more children are immunized and to increase consumer access to affordable clean energy. Most recently, Senator Wolk led the effort to pass the groundbreaking End of Life Option Act, ensuring that Californians suffering from terminal illness can choose to die on their own terms. Senator Wolk currently serves as the Majority Whip and chairs the Senate Budget Subcommittee on Resources, Environmental Protection, Energy and Transportation. Mr. Speaker, Senator Wolk is my friend and a valued colleague, and has been an exemplary public servant for close to three decades and it is therefore fitting and proper that we honor her here today. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1139] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING SENATOR LOIS WOLK ______ HON.

JOSEPH CROWLEY of new york in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity today to urge my colleagues to not let the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program lapse. As the co-chair of the House Congressional Rare Disease Caucus, I know first-hand how successful this program has been for children and their families throughout the country and I am determined for it to continue. Unfortunately, the program expires September 30th, which could curb continued research and development in the areas of rare pediatric conditions. One condition that very much relies on the incentives of the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program is epidermolysis bullosa (``EB''), and those suffering from the condition are in desperate need of treatments and cures. EB is a rare, debilitating, and potentially fatal connective tissue disorder that manifests through severe [[Page E1140]] blisters on the skin, eyes, throat, and internal organs. Children with EB are often called ``butterfly children'' because their skin so fragile. As with most rare diseases, EB can vary in progression and severity among its various types and subtypes. The most severe form of EB, recessive dystrophic EB, puts children at especially high risk for infection. Typically, even a mild localized trauma can cause skin to fall off, leading to open sores that do not heal, which cause indescribable pain and agony. In addition to the risk of infection, other conditions associated with EB include cancer, heart failure, malnutrition, and foot and hand deformities. I have heard the heartbreaking stories of children with this form, such as Rafi Kopelan and Jackson Silver of New York City and Mikey Fullmer of Irvine, California. Imagine being eight years old, unable to play soccer or swim, covered in bandages, enduring regular painful vinegar and bleach baths, and fighting through the discomfort to eat and breathe. This has been a reality for kids like Rafi, Jackson, and Mikey. New York City is home to two of the three leading patient advocacy and research organizations representing the EB community--debra of America and the EB Research Partnership. I would like to recognize the tremendous impact both organizations, as well as the Los Angeles, California based EB Medical Research Foundation, are having on the community. Due to their efforts, several drug manufacturers are currently in the research and development phase for various treatments for EB--from topical creams to protein replacement therapies. The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program has been instrumental in creating an incentive for these companies to finally allocate resources to investigating potential solutions for children with EB beyond pain management and wound care. But more progress is needed. Further research is necessary, for example, to develop interventions against a particularly virulent form of squamous cell carcinoma in EB patients, which has a mortality rate approaching 90 percent. Congress has long supported EB research funding through the National Institutes of Health, which has helped lay the foundation for these existing development programs. Reauthorizing the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program, however, is a critical way of providing the necessary incentives to ensure children like Rafi, Jackson, and Mikey will soon benefit from this important research in the form of FDA-approved therapies. We must not let this deadline slip and this important program expire, and I hope all my colleagues recognize the urgency of this issue. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1139-E1140] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF EXTENDING THE RARE PEDIATRIC DISEASE PRIORITY REVIEW VOUCHER PROGRAM ______ HON.

SPARAGANA,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1140] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING POTTSTOWN SUPERINTENDENT DR. JEFFREY R. SPARAGANA ______ HON. RYAN A. COSTELLO of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pottstown School District Superintendent, Dr. Jeffrey R. Sparagana, as he prepares to retire after a career in education spanning more than four decades. For the past 23 years, Dr. Sparagana has held a variety of teaching, administrative, and coaching positions in the Pottstown School District. He was appointed superintendent in December 2012, demonstrating outstanding leadership during what his colleagues described as ``the most tumultuous period of change'' in the District's 177-year history. It was a period that saw the District revise attendance boundaries, close one elementary school and renovate four others, and realign the Middle School to include fifth grade. Innovation, a commitment to academic excellence and accountability and an incredible ability to collaborate with teachers, parents and the community were hallmarks of Dr. Sparagana's tenure. Those traits undoubtedly contributed to Pottstown earning national accolades for its PEAK program, which ensures students start kindergarten properly prepared for a lifetime of learning.

JANICE HAHN of california in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Maralin Niska who passed away at home in Santa Fe, New Mexico on July 9, 2016. Maralin sang leading roles with both the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera and was widely known as one of the greatest talents of her generation. She was not only an acclaimed soprano, she was a devoted teacher who loved sharing her passion with admirers and her community. Born in San Pedro, California, on November 16, 1926, Maralin Niska showed early promise as a musical student. In her youth, she performed as a young soloist in the First Presbyterian Church of San Pedro as well as with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Despite the advice of teachers and friends, she refused to go to Europe to study and build a career. She told the New York Times, ``I've never even been to Europe, and I don't have any desire to go . . . I'm still one of the few holdouts who are truly American in training, experience, everything.'' She never wavered in her love for her community and country. Ms. Niska completed her degree at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in English literature and continued to study voice at the University of Southern California (USC) and UCLA. All the while, she continued to sing as a resident soloist at several community churches. Ms. Niska had a rewarding career in education and was a Torrance elementary schoolteacher for seven years, while continuing to perform for local opera companies and the community. She loved teaching, and appreciated all students at whatever level they could achieve. In 1968, Ms. Niska sang the title role in Madama Butterfly for the opening of the new house at the Santa Fe Opera. After retiring in Santa Fe, Ms Niska continued her passion for teaching and maintained a private vocal studio. There, she taught Master Classes to aspiring students who shared her love for music. The Arizona Daily Star even wrote that Ms. Niska left ``most of the traditional diva [[Page E1141]] arrogance back in the dressing room . . . She offered no-nonsense criticism to her students but tried not to trample their ego.'' Niska's dramatic talents earned her a reputation as a singing- actress. Ms. Niska appeared regularly with some of the great conductors of her time, including Pierre Boulez, Eric Leinsdorf, and Andre Kostelanetz. She received national recognition when she debuted at the opening of the Metropolitan Opera National Company in 1965. Followed by her debut, she was engaged by the New York City Opera and commanded dozens of roles. In all she sang 29 leading roles with the company--the most of any singer in its history. Ms. Niska gave her last professional performance in 1996, in Santa Fe, performing arias of Mozart with the Musica de Camara Orchestra conducted by her husband, the famous violinist and renowned conductor, William Mullen. The couple established Music One, a predecessor to Performance Santa Fe, a performing arts center. Maralin Niska was loved by all and will be sorely missed by her husband, students, the greater communities of Los Angeles and Santa Fe, and by opera lovers all over the world. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1140-E1141] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MARALIN NISKA ______ HON.

G.K. BUTTERFIELD of north carolina in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my hope that the House of Representatives will reauthorize the Rare Pediatric Priority Review Voucher (PRV) Program before its expiration deadline of September 30, 2016. I urge my colleagues to consider and pass H.R. 1537, the Advancing Hope Act of 2015 which I introduced with Representative Michael McCaul (TX-10) and would permanently reauthorize the Rare Pediatric PRV Program. The Creating Hope Act, which was signed into law by President Obama in 2012 as part of the PDUFA reauthorization, expanded the cost-neutral Food and Drug Administration (FDA) priority review voucher (PRV) program, allowing pharmaceutical companies to expedite FDA review of more profitable drugs in return for developing treatments for rare diseases. The Creating Hope Act was reauthorized for Fiscal Year 2016 through the budget agreement passed at the end of last year, but is scheduled to expire soon. The Butterfield-McCaul bill would reauthorize the program, clear the way for more treatments to reach the people that need them most, and clarify the scope of the program to include diseases like Sickle Cell Anemia. There are many pediatric disease spaces where treatments are woefully inadequate or nonexistent, and the Advancing Hope Act of 2015 would help encourage the private sector to help find solutions. An example of a condition that could benefit from the reauthorization of the Rare Pediatric PRV Program is Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood, known as AHC, which leads to life-threatening temporary paralysis in approximately three hundred children nationwide. Duke Children's Hospital and Health Center, located in North Carolina's First Congressional District, assists North Carolinian children Matthew Wuchich, Madison Pino, and Marley Pino, manage their conditions. However, they often have to travel long distances for care or be pulled out of school, and there is no cure in sight. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reauthorize the Rare Pediatric PRV Program before the program expires in September. Congress must do all it can to encourage the development of cures for children like Matthew, Madison, and Marley. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1141] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RARE PEDIATRIC PRIORITY REVIEW VOUCHER PROGRAM ______ HON.

WILLIAM R. KEATING of massachusetts in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Westport River Watershed Alliance on the occasion of its 40th anniversary. The Watershed Alliance, originally created to protest a septic- composting lagoon project on the Upper East Branch of the Westport River, was established by a small group of 14 concerned Westport residents. What started as a single protest in 1976 has grown to a membership of over 1,500 families and 4,800 volunteers that work on numerous conservation projects from running the longest water quality monitoring program in Massachusetts to planting over 20,000 beach grass seedlings in the past decade to stabilize eroded areas of the Town Beach dune system in the Commonwealth. The Watershed Alliance has successfully given voice to the natural resource concerns of the Westport River. It has become a leader in environmental preservation efforts in the region and represents the best of the Westport community. The Watershed Alliance has, over the years, worked with state legislators to remove granite blocks out from underneath a bridge that restricted flow to the Upper East Branch part of the river, it has hosted over 28 River Day festivals, has planted 6 rain gardens at the Westport Middle School which were used to capture and treat over 60% of the storm water that flowed previously unchecked into the water, and it is working with the Town of Westport and MA Estuaries Project to come up with alternatives to expensive sewer treatments to help solve the nitrogen pollution problem in an efficient and affordable manner. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Westport River Watershed Alliance's four decade commitment to protecting the Westport River. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the service and commitment of the members of the Westport River Watershed Alliance. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1141] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE WESTPORT RIVER WATERSHED ALLIANCE ______ HON.

Once again, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are using the pretext of religious liberty to violate the fundamental human rights of women. This bill is another in a long line of Republican attempts to limit women's access to safe, legal abortion--like the Weldon and Hyde amendments. Let me be clear: no employer or politician has the right to interfere with a woman's personal healthcare choices. These decisions belong to women--not politicians or bosses. Mr. Speaker, this bill is dangerous. Instead of addressing the serious issues facing American families-- like combatting Zika, addressing gun violence, or creating jobs--my colleagues have chosen to put partisan politics over healthcare access.

Mr. Schmidt devoted twenty-one years of his life to the United States Army, including assignments and deployments during the Vietnam War. After he completed his military service, his dedication to public service did not stop. Between 1989 and 1993, Mr. Schmidt worked for the Army Research Laboratory in the Army Material Command, during which he helped develop technology over multiple fields such as weapons systems, medical equipment, and protection tools. This research has helped save American lives, and gives our soldiers an edge in the performance of their duties to our country. From 1994 to 1998, Mr. Schmidt refocused his talents as acting Science and Technology Advisor to the Director for Force Development, where he evaluated and managed the Army's annual research programs budget. Through such [[Page E1142]] means, Mr. Schmidt fought to maintain the Army's ability to look after its troops by providing state of the art equipment and technology. Mr. Schmidt continued to fight to maintain the Army's research funding levels for another decade, as both a Deputy Director and Director specializing in science and technology at the Department of the Army. He maintained the Army's budget of $13 billion, which allocated funds to over twenty projects with a total workforce in excess of 14,000 engineering and research staff. His civilian assignment spanned three decades in the Department of the Army. Mr. Schmidt will best be remembered for his dedication to preserving and increasing funding for suicide prevention, and developing new weapons technologies to aid in keeping our troops safer and better equipped while serving their country. Mr. Speaker, Dennis Schmidt embodies what it means to be an American patriot. He is an impressive example of going beyond his duty, and he should be honored for it.

It was one hundred years ago, in celebration of Indiana's Centennial, that Mooresville resident and prominent water color artist Paul Hadley designed the current Indiana flag. It is easy to see why Hadley's design for the banner was selected out of the two hundred that were entered in the Daughters of the American Revolution contest in 1816. The stately gold torch signifying liberty and enlightenment, surrounded by nineteen gold stars representing each of the states in the union upon Indiana's induction, is stunning on the beautiful field of deep blue. One year later the Indiana State Legislature adopted Paul Hadley's design as the official state banner. It has remained unchanged since that day. Mooresville is located in Morgan County in central Indiana. And on this day, Mr. Speaker, in the year in which we are celebrating Indiana's 200th birthday, I am proud to recognize the town of Mooresville for Paul Hadley's important contribution to Indiana's history. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1142] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF MOORESVILLE, INDIANA ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and salute the Town of Mooresville, Indiana, as the official Home of the Indiana State Flag. It was one hundred years ago, in celebration of Indiana's Centennial, that Mooresville resident and prominent water color artist Paul Hadley designed the current Indiana flag. It is easy to see why Hadley's design for the banner was selected out of the two hundred that were entered in the Daughters of the American Revolution contest in 1816.

BRADLEY BYRNE of alabama in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Representatives Aderholt (AL), Black (TN), Blackburn (TN), Brooks (AL), Chabot (OH), Collins (NY), Fudge (OH), Gibbs (OH), Guinta (NH), Hanna (NY), Higgins (NY), Joyce (OH), Kelly (PA), Palmer (AL), Pingree (ME), Poliquin (ME), Reed (NY), Renacci (OH), Roby (AL), Roe (TN), Rogers (AL), Sewell (AL), Stefanik (NY), Tiberi (OH), Turner (OH), Wenstrup (OH), and Yarmuth (KY), I want to recognize three men who will attempt to pedal their bicycles from Houlton, Maine to Mobile, Alabama between July 29 and August 8, 2016. Ride4Gabe, as it is called, will take the cyclists on a route that is approximately the same distance as the Tour de France in only eleven days. As they pedal 200 miles per day the men will endure substantial physical and mental hardship. The cycling effort alone is worthy of recognition, but these cyclists insist it is their cause that should be known by the American people. Ride4Gabe is really about ending Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. According to Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne is the most common fatal genetic disorder diagnosed in childhood, affecting approximately 1 in every 3,500 live male births (about 20,000 new cases each year worldwide). Because the Duchenne gene is found on the X- chromosome, it primarily affects boys; however, it occurs across all races and cultures. Duchenne results in progressive loss of strength and is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for dystrophin. Because dystrophin is absent, the muscle cells are easily damaged. The progressive muscle weakness leads to serious medical problems, particularly issues relating to the heart and lungs. Young men with Duchenne typically live into their late twenties. Michael Staley, 35, of Birmingham, Alabama, and Wes Bates, 21, of Aurora, Colorado, began Ride4Gabe in 2014 when they rode across Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama. Payne Griffin, 23, of Washington, D.C. will join Michael and Wes this year. The trio will be supported by a crew of volunteers as they pedal across Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama. The Ride4Gabe team will meet with Duchenne patients, rare disease- impacted families, elected officials, and other community leaders throughout their journey. They will educate people about Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. They will highlight the challenges associated with Duchenne through the lens of Gabe Griffin and Duchenne patients all along their route. They will discuss how medical research has the Duchenne community on the verge of solving this problem that nobody has survived to date. They will raise awareness about rare disease drug approval policy and how it relates to Duchenne. On behalf of my colleagues representing the congressional districts along the Ride4Gabe 2016 route, I am pleased to submit this statement to the Congressional Record. The awareness raised through Ride4Gabe will lead to greater public awareness about Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. It is our hope that Gabe Griffin and every other patient who suffers from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy will soon have access to a treatment, and ultimately a cure. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1142] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING RIDE4GABE FOR BRINGING NEEDED AWARENESS TO DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY ______ HON.

RAUL RUIZ of calfornia in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an outstanding leader in my district, Mr. Rodolfo Pinon of Blythe, California. Mr. Speaker, Rodolfo is a remarkable leader, husband, and father. He has a deep passion for serving others and giving voice to the voiceless. From his early years as a student at Palo Verde Valley High School and then at California State University at San Bernardino, Rodolfo served as an example of selfless service to the underserved. That drive and passion to serve his community has been steadfast throughout his career. As the executive director of Casa De San Bernardino he was a source of strength and an anchor of hope to those seeking to overcome addiction. For five years, his dedication there helped countless individuals in their darkest hours. Recently, Rodolfo has served as the Director of Community Engagement for the Pueblo Unido Community Development Corporation. He serves as a driving force behind their mission to support underrepresented rural communities. As director, has delivered over and over again on the goals of developing affordable housing, community infrastructure, community centers, and community parks to disadvantaged rural communities. This work has solved pressing problems for the residents of the Eastern Coachella Valley, from installing water filters to 25 mobile home parks in the Eastern Coachella Valley where far too many communities face the health threat of arsenic in the unfiltered water, to paving the 38 mobile home parks in the community, helping families in these rural areas have a higher quality of life and improving outcomes for those seeking affordable housing, to building the San Jose and Bea Main Community Center open to all in the community and helping young people expand their horizons with a brand new computer center. But his dedication has also inspired countless budding community leaders around him and he has mentored many emerging young leaders. Recently, Rodolfo's life of service was chronicled in the book Y Suguimos Adelante. This book serves as a lasting tribute to his mission and as a constant reminder of his counsel that we must always remain selfless in our work serving our communities. His words have deeply inspired me, and I keep them in mind each day in my work as a public servant. Rodolfo was recently diagnosed with advanced liver cancer. His family and loved ones are going through a terrible pain. As a community, we encourage Rodolfo and his family to find strength and comfort in the fact that we appreciate and honor you. The best way to honor Rodolfo to ensure that his mission and noble acts of service are spread beyond the Coachella valley, that his words are not forgotten. We should all take to heart his service, a man who has given everything to his community and asks for nothing in return, except that those around him are able to live a healthy life with dignity. We should all honor him and enter his life's work into our nation's record. So today, I would like to take a moment to recognize all that Mr. Pinon has given to his community that will live on for future generations. In honor of his life's work of service, let us keep Rodolfo in our thoughts as journeys through this most difficult path of his life. Let us not forget all this man has given to our community and how much we can learn from his actions. In his honor, let us strive to better our communities, and our nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1143] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING RODOLFO PINON ______ HON.

This work has solved pressing problems for the residents of the Eastern Coachella Valley, from installing water filters to 25 mobile home parks in the Eastern Coachella Valley where far too many communities face the health threat of arsenic in the unfiltered water, to paving the 38 mobile home parks in the community, helping families in these rural areas have a higher quality of life and improving outcomes for those seeking affordable housing, to building the San Jose and Bea Main Community Center open to all in the community and helping young people expand their horizons with a brand new computer center. But his dedication has also inspired countless budding community leaders around him and he has mentored many emerging young leaders. Recently, Rodolfo's life of service was chronicled in the book Y Suguimos Adelante. This book serves as a lasting tribute to his mission and as a constant reminder of his counsel that we must always remain selfless in our work serving our communities. His words have deeply inspired me, and I keep them in mind each day in my work as a public servant. Rodolfo was recently diagnosed with advanced liver cancer. His family and loved ones are going through a terrible pain. As a community, we encourage Rodolfo and his family to find strength and comfort in the fact that we appreciate and honor you. The best way to honor Rodolfo to ensure that his mission and noble acts of service are spread beyond the Coachella valley, that his words are not forgotten. We should all take to heart his service, a man who has given everything to his community and asks for nothing in return, except that those around him are able to live a healthy life with dignity. We should all honor him and enter his life's work into our nation's record. So today, I would like to take a moment to recognize all that Mr. Pinon has given to his community that will live on for future generations. In honor of his life's work of service, let us keep Rodolfo in our thoughts as journeys through this most difficult path of his life. Let us not forget all this man has given to our community and how much we can learn from his actions. In his honor, let us strive to better our communities, and our nation. ____________________",package_114_218.csv,3756,3756,3823,"[congressional record volume 162, number 115 (friday, july 15, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1143] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] recognizing rodolfo pinon ______ hon. raul ruiz of calfornia in the house of representatives thursday, july 14, 2016 mr. ruiz. mr. speaker, i rise to recognize an outstanding leader in my district, mr. rodolfo pinon of blythe, california. mr. speaker, rodolfo is a remarkable leader, husband, and father. he has a deep passion for serving others and giving voice to the voiceless. from his early years as a student at palo verde valley high school and then at california state university at san bernardino, rodolfo served as an example of selfless service to the underserved. that drive and passion to serve his community has been steadfast throughout his career. as the executive director of casa de san bernardino he was a source of strength and an anchor of hope to those seeking to overcome addiction. for five years, his dedication there helped countless individuals in their darkest hours. recently, rodolfo has served as the director of community engagement for the pueblo unido community development corporation. he serves as a driving force behind their mission to support underrepresented rural communities. as director, has delivered over and over again on the goals of developing affordable housing, community infrastructure, community centers, and community parks to disadvantaged rural communities. this work has solved pressing problems for the residents of the eastern coachella valley, from installing water filters to 25 mobile home parks in the eastern coachella valley where far too many communities face the health threat of arsenic in the unfiltered water, to paving the 38 mobile home parks in the community, helping families in these rural areas have a higher quality of life and improving outcomes for those seeking affordable housing, to building the san jose and bea main community center open to all in the community and helping young people expand their horizons with a brand new computer center. but his dedication has also inspired countless budding community leaders around him and he has mentored many emerging young leaders. recently, rodolfo's life of service was chronicled in the book y suguimos adelante. this book serves as a lasting tribute to his mission and as a constant reminder of his counsel that we must always remain selfless in our work serving our communities. his words have deeply inspired me, and i keep them in mind each day in my work as a public servant. rodolfo was recently diagnosed with advanced liver cancer. his family and loved ones are going through a terrible pain. as a community, we encourage rodolfo and his family to find strength and comfort in the fact that we appreciate and honor you. the best way to honor rodolfo to ensure that his mission and noble acts of service are spread beyond the coachella valley, that his words are not forgotten. we should all take to heart his service, a man who has given everything to his community and asks for nothing in return, except that those around him are able to live a healthy life with dignity. we should all honor him and enter his life's work into our nation's record. so today, i would like to take a moment to recognize all that mr. pinon has given to his community that will live on for future generations. in honor of his life's work of service, let us keep rodolfo in our thoughts as journeys through this most difficult path of his life. let us not forget all this man has given to our community and how much we can learn from his actions. in his honor, let us strive to better our communities, and our nation. ____________________",3756

TERRI A. SEWELL of alabama in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today, I re-introduced H.R. 5783, the Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts Act of 2016. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and are an essential component of our continued economic recovery. These businesses generate half of our nation's gross domestic product and employ at least half of its workforce. The creation of small businesses allows Americans to produce things right here in America, as well as continue to out innovate and out-build the rest of the world. Unfortunately, the average entrepreneur spends roughly $80,000 in first year start-up costs, and these recovering economic times have made it even more difficult for prospective business owners to access vital start-up capital. As our economy continues to strengthen, it is important that Congress provides incentives and opportunities for entrepreneurs to launch new businesses and provide much needed jobs to our economy. For these reasons, I am re-introducing The Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts Act to assist individuals in starting their own businesses. This bill expands much needed lending to millions of small businesses and offers tax incentives to help small businesses grow, hire, [[Page E1143]] and fuel our economy. The bill would allow entrepreneurs to contribute up to $10,000 per year into a tax-free account, which could be used to purchase equipment, facilities, marketing, training, and accounting. Contributions to the account could accumulate up to $150,000 and be taken out tax-free. This is a common sense approach to encourage economic growth, and Congress should spend more of its time on legislation like this that can have a positive impact on average Americans. I urge all of my colleagues to co-sponsor this legislation and I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1142-E1143] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE SMALL BUSINESS START-UP SAVINGS ACCOUNTS ACT OF 2016 ______ HON.

BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Monday, July 11, 2016 Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 (H. Res. 818). I remain frustrated by Congress' inability to pass a long-term extension of FAA authority and I am concerned with some of the language included within this reauthorization. However, these reservations do not justify opposition to the bill and I therefore support its passage. Without this extension, current FAA authority would expire on July 15, causing major side effects that would cripple our economy. I commend Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio as well as the entire Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for putting aside differences and negotiating this FAA extension. This legislation addresses some of the many issues that face our airline industry. Specifically, I am pleased by the inclusion of language that streamlines the hiring process of air-traffic controllers. Representatives from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) have been urging Congress to help solve the 27-year low in the air-traffic controller workforce and I am confident that this provision will help address this massive backlog. The reauthorization also directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to expand the PreCheck program as well as optimize the staffing allocation model-- both vital steps in helping reduce wait times while also enhancing security precautions. Furthermore, the extension requires training for flight attendants to help recognize and respond to potential victims of human trafficking, an issue that affects millions of people across the world and cannot be ignored. Although the extension helps address many important issues facing air travel, I am concerned with some of the language included in the reauthorization. Of particular concern is language in Section 3405 which directs the TSA to change regulations pertaining to vetting standards for aviation workers with access to secure and sterile areas of airports. In the wake of the terrorist attacks in Brussels and Istanbul, I understand the concerns that Members may have with tightening security in and around airports; however, this screening expansion will unfairly affect airline workers and Homeland Security experts have yet to provide credible evidence that this will actually help mitigate terrorist activity. The provision not only extends the background check period from ten years to fifteen years, but it also expands the list of ``disqualifying offenses'' for Security Identification Display Area (SIDA) badge holders, potentially causing many longtime, responsible airline workers to lose their job. Although I support the passage of this reauthorization, I must voice my disappointment in the Leadership's inability to advance a long-term solution that the various stakeholders within air travel can depend on. Mr. Speaker, we must take the time between now and September, 2017 when this reauthorization expires to put aside partisan differences and produce a long-term extension that our airline industry so desperately needs. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1144] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAA EXTENSION, SAFETY, AND SECURITY ACT OF 2016 ______ speech of HON.

EARL BLUMENAUER of oregon in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to introduce the Columbia River In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access Sites Improvement Act, in partnership with some of my colleagues in the Senate. This legislation is just one part of the work we are pursuing, in coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and in collaboration with affected Columbia River Treaty Tribes, to improve conditions and address unmet tribal housing needs along the Columbia River. This issue deserves significant attention and investment from the federal government. The history of the 31 Columbia River In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access Sites dates back decades. Western development, including construction of the three lower Columbia River dams beginning in the 1930s, displaced many members of the four Columbia River treaty tribes: the Warm Springs, Umatilla, Nez Perce, and Yakama Nation. Those tribes have a treaty-protected right to fish along the river at their usual and accustomed places, and were also promised housing to replace what was inundated after the dams became operational. That promise has largely not been kept. I'm working with my colleagues to address these unmet needs through the appropriations process and other legislation. To address fishing access that was wiped out by the dams, the Corps constructed 31 small sites along the Columbia, designed primarily for daily, in-season fishing access and temporary camping. However, largely due to the lack of promised permanent housing and out of a desire to be closer to the Columbia River, their cultural heritage, and traditional fishing areas, many tribal members live in makeshift housing or shelters at these sites. Because they were not designed for longer-term or permanent use, the conditions at these sites are deeply distressing and unsafe, without proper electricity, sewers, or water. I have seen these conditions firsthand on multiple visits, and they have garnered attention from local and national media. The sites are in dire need of urgent upgrades to electrical, sewer, and other infrastructure, beyond their daily operations and maintenance needs. This legislation calls for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to conduct a much-needed assessment of current conditions at the In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access sites under BIA ownership on both sides of the Columbia, in coordination with the Tribes. It authorizes the BIA to improve existing federal structures and infrastructure, improve sanitation and safety conditions, and improve access to electricity, sewer, and water infrastructure. BIA may contract with Tribes and Tribal organizations to conduct this important work that will lay a critical foundation for the construction of permanent tribal housing.

EARL BLUMENAUER of oregon in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to introduce the Columbia River In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access Sites Improvement Act, in partnership with some of my colleagues in the Senate. This legislation is just one part of the work we are pursuing, in coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and in collaboration with affected Columbia River Treaty Tribes, to improve conditions and address unmet tribal housing needs along the Columbia River. This issue deserves significant attention and investment from the federal government. The history of the 31 Columbia River In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access Sites dates back decades. Western development, including construction of the three lower Columbia River dams beginning in the 1930s, displaced many members of the four Columbia River treaty tribes: the Warm Springs, Umatilla, Nez Perce, and Yakama Nation. Those tribes have a treaty-protected right to fish along the river at their usual and accustomed places, and were also promised housing to replace what was inundated after the dams became operational. That promise has largely not been kept. I'm working with my colleagues to address these unmet needs through the appropriations process and other legislation. To address fishing access that was wiped out by the dams, the Corps constructed 31 small sites along the Columbia, designed primarily for daily, in-season fishing access and temporary camping. However, largely due to the lack of promised permanent housing and out of a desire to be closer to the Columbia River, their cultural heritage, and traditional fishing areas, many tribal members live in makeshift housing or shelters at these sites. Because they were not designed for longer-term or permanent use, the conditions at these sites are deeply distressing and unsafe, without proper electricity, sewers, or water. I have seen these conditions firsthand on multiple visits, and they have garnered attention from local and national media. The sites are in dire need of urgent upgrades to electrical, sewer, and other infrastructure, beyond their daily operations and maintenance needs. This legislation calls for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to conduct a much-needed assessment of current conditions at the In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access sites under BIA ownership on both sides of the Columbia, in coordination with the Tribes. It authorizes the BIA to improve existing federal structures and infrastructure, improve sanitation and safety conditions, and improve access to electricity, sewer, and water infrastructure. BIA may contract with Tribes and Tribal organizations to conduct this important work that will lay a critical foundation for the construction of permanent tribal housing. This is a significant and meaningful step in helping to improve conditions at these sites and should be passed by both the House and Senate. Our efforts will not stop here. I will continue working with federal partners and Tribal nations to see that the need for more permanent housing is fulfilled. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1144] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE COLUMBIA RIVER IN-LIEU AND TREATY FISHING ACCESS SITES IMPROVEMENT ACT ______ HON.

MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO of guam in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, today I reintroduced a bill to amend and reauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. Conservation of coral reef ecosystems is essential to protect public health, promote environmental sustainability, and ensure long-term economic progress for the jurisdictions we represent in Congress. The sovereign waters of the United States off the coast of Guam, and in the Pacific region as a whole, contain a majority of the shallow-water coral reefs in the United States, as well as some of the world's greatest coral reef biodiversity. These reefs, and reefs around the world, provide habitat and shelter for fisheries, provide food and recreation for our residents, and are the basis for marine tourism industries. Coral reefs also provide important mitigation from extreme weather events, including hurricanes and typhoons, by absorbing up to 90% [[Page E1145]] of wave energy, mitigating some of the most costly aspects of severe storms. Coastal storms account for 71% of annual disaster losses. Healthy reef systems may protect an estimated $47,000 of property value for every meter of reef during severe weather events. Today, however, various pressures on the world's reefs threaten to destroy them and the numerous ecosystem services, valued at over $8 billion, which they provide. Unless the United States acts in conjunction with the global community to support focused, prolonged action on coral reef education, research, and management, the condition of our coral reefs will continue to degrade. Since its enactment in 2000, the Coral Reef Conservation Act has stimulated a greater commitment to protect, conserve, and restore coral reef resources within jurisdictional waters of the United States. As a result, we now have a much better grasp of the condition of our coral reefs, and more focused management capability than at any time in our history. The Coral Reef Conservation Act Reauthorization and Enhancement Amendments of 2016 expands emergency response mechanisms, establishes a new community-based planning grants program, promotes international cooperation, and recognizes the important contributions of the U.S. Department of the Interior in coral reef management and conservation efforts. This bill would also codify the United States Coral Reef Task Force established in 1998 by President Clinton through Executive Order 13089. The work of the Task Force and its mission to coordinate the efforts of the United States in promoting conservation and the sustainable use of coral reefs internationally is vital to our interests. Since 1998, the Task Force has acted to facilitate and support better management and conservation of coral reef resources at the local level. Many beneficial efforts, such as the development and implementation of local action strategies to address threats to our reefs, are underway thanks to the work of the Task Force and its member agencies. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this legislation to enhance our capacity for the conservation and restoration of healthy and diverse coral reef ecosystems. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1144-E1145] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CORAL REEF CONSERVATION ACT REAUTHORIZATION AND ENHANCEMENT AMENDMENTS OF 2016 ______ HON.

DAN BENISHEK of michigan in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize 100 years of service from the Mio Hydro facility, named after the adjacent town of Mio and located on the lower Au Sable River. During that time it has provided reliable power to thousands of families and businesses in Oscoda County, Michigan. In the early 1900's, Consumers Energy founders, William A. and James B. Foote sought out to harness the energy of the Au Sable River to power the mills and growing cities of the surrounding area. Between 1911 and 1924, six hydroelectric dams were constructed. Mio Hydro was the fourth dam constructed and was completed in 1916. This facility was unique in that it was the first hydroelectric dam to utilize an under-sluice spillway. Invented and patented by Consumers civil engineer, William W. Tefft, the design allows excess water to flow through conduits built into the foundation of the powerhouse instead of through an above ground gated spillway. This new design was proven to lower construction costs and increased the plant's power production. This year I am pleased to join all the Consumers Energy employees and retirees to commemorate 100 years of clean, reliable and renewable energy generated by this facility. A century of service is a testament to the dedicated men and women that have kept watch over Mio and supplied power to generations of Michiganders. Congratulations on this great achievement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1145] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MIO HYDRO FOR 100 YEARS OF SERVICE ______ HON.

Since its founding in 1866, Axalta has evolved to meet ever-changing industry demands and to fully utilize today's innovative technology. Axalta now does business in over 130 countries and employs more than 12,800 people. However, what has remained constant during this time is Axalta's commitment to quality and to its many customers across the globe. In Virginia, Axalta's Front Royal Plant is celebrating 35 years of operation. The Front Royal Plant, located near the border between the Sixth and Tenth Congressional Districts, employs many of our constituents and is a valued member of the community. The Front Royal Plant manufactures and distributes high quality paint products primarily in small container packaging for the ``Low Bake'' customers in the Refinish and Industrial markets with more than 12 million gallons produced annually. Constructed in 1980 with the first batch of paint produced in March 1981, the facility is nine acres under roof and includes a finished product warehouse that serves as a critical Regional Service Center for the business. There are more than 325 full-time Axalta employees in Front Royal and approximately 80 additional contractor employees onsite. We thank Axalta for their commitment to providing employment and driving economic growth in the Northern Shenandoah Valley. Congratulations again on reaching this milestone.

On June 3, 2016 Richard (Dick) B. Van Ransom-Magana, the founder of Mariposa Ice Cream, passed away. Dick was an inspiration to his family, friends and the patrons of his ice cream parlor. He was a beloved member of the Normal Heights community and a respected Adams Avenue business owner. His dynamic personality left a lasting impression on all those who knew him, even for just a fleeting moment, as they passed through to order ice cream. Like many, the Navy originally brought Dick to San Diego, but he chose to make San Diego his home. His grandfather taught him ice cream making, and with his wife Anna he became a fixture in Normal Heights sharing ice cream and conversation with everyone who passed through his store. During a packed memorial mass at St. Didacus Catholic Church on June 24th, he was called a light to others and a source of goodness and inspiration. Person after person remarked on his warmth, love for his family, and his great contributions to the Normal Heights community.

SUSAN A. DAVIS of california in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a treasured member of the San Diego family. On June 3, 2016 Richard (Dick) B. Van Ransom-Magana, the founder of Mariposa Ice Cream, passed away. Dick was an inspiration to his family, friends and the patrons of his ice cream parlor. He was a beloved member of the Normal Heights community and a respected Adams Avenue business owner. His dynamic personality left a lasting impression on all those who knew him, even for just a fleeting moment, as they passed through to order ice cream. Like many, the Navy originally brought Dick to San Diego, but he chose to make San Diego his home. His grandfather taught him ice cream making, and with his wife Anna he became a fixture in Normal Heights sharing ice cream and conversation with everyone who passed through his store. During a packed memorial mass at St. Didacus Catholic Church on June 24th, he was called a light to others and a source of goodness and inspiration. Person after person remarked on his warmth, love for his family, and his great contributions to the Normal Heights community.

Mr. Speaker, I rise along with my colleague Mr. Moulton of Massachusetts to recognize Major General Augustus ``Leon'' Collins, commanding general of both the Mississippi Army and Air National Guard. Since 2012, Major General Collins has served as the Adjutant General of Mississippi and plans to retire at the beginning of September. Major General Collins has served in the military for 35 years, starting as a private with Company B, 1st Battalion, 198th Armor Regiment. He completed officer candidate school and later served in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. From 2004 to 2006, he commanded the 155th Armored Brigade Combat Team during Operation Iraqi Freedom. I have served with Major General Collins at nearly all levels of command. As a tank company commander, Captain Collins was one of the finest. His troops respected and loved him and accomplished tasks other units would not have dared to attempt. As a Battalion Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Collins led his Battalion to be one of the best. Finally, as a Brigade Commander of a Brigade Combat Team in Iraq, Brigadier General Collins continued his path of excellence. Brigadier General Collins led the 155th Brigade Combat Team, Mississippi Rifles, in a full spectrum mission; his unit once again excelled because of his leadership and the high level of respect and trust he earned among his soldiers. He did this while many of his soldiers were impacted by the devastating news of Hurricane Katrina at home in Mississippi. During Major General Collins' tenure in Iraq, he led two future congressmen. After we were elected to the 114th Congress, Mr. Moulton and I realized we had previously met while serving in Iraq with Major General Collins. This is representative of the diverse lives Major General Collins has led and mentored during his storied career. As Major General Collins retires from the military, I know he will continue to be a leader in the state and nation. He has been a mentor and role model for a generation of soldiers in the Mississippi Army National Guard. I am honored to have served with him at all levels of command. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1147] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MAJOR GENERAL AUGUSTUS ``LEON'' COLLINS, ADJUTANT GENERAL OF MISSISSIPPI ______ HON.

MARY JEZOWSKI-SURGE ______ HON. DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mary Jezowski- Surge, a longtime Michigan resident, and an original Rosie the Riveter. Mary was born on September 1, 1922 and is celebrating her 94th birthday this year. Mary and the original Rosie the Riveters paved the way for women in the workforce, forever changing our nation with their bravery, grace and gusto. In World War II, enlistment left gaping holes in the labor force, prompting women to join the ranks of male factory workers. These inspiring women were collectively nicknamed ``Rosie the Riveter'' and worked building planes, tanks, and other armaments for soldiers fighting abroad. Mary worked at the Cadillac Plant in Detroit building tanks for American troops. She began her time in the factory as a grinder, eventually becoming a welder. She recalls the thrill that came with climbing up on top of the tanks to do her welding. Mary eventually left the Cadillac Plant to begin work at the Lincoln Plant where she built airplane engines. More than 310,000 women joined the U.S. aircraft industry in 1943, comprising a stunning 65 percent of the aviation industry's total workforce. Mary and other women who worked in Michigan's aviation plants were honored for their efforts and have their names engraved on a plaque at Yankee Air Museum in Belleville, Michigan. The contributions of Mary and the original Rosie the Riveters made victory in World War II possible, and their patriotism and hard work will forever remain part of the American story. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me today in honoring Mary for her contributions to the war effort, and for her fearlessness as a trailblazer for women in the workforce. The values that Mary and the Rosies embodied--patriotism, bravery and resolve--are ones we all must strive to emulate. The Rosies are a vitally important part of American history, and their impact on the workforce will never diminish. Their story is one we will continue to share with our children and grandchildren for generations to come, and their spirit and legacy will forever remind us that we all wield the power to positively contribute to our country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1147] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF MRS.

Chief Dove joined the Brownsburg Police Department in 1990 as a Reserve Officer and was later hired as a full-time officer in 1992. Throughout his career, Chief Dove has held every sworn rank at the department and has filled many roles, including Training Officer, Instructor, Shift Supervisor, Detective, Undercover Investigator, Emergency Response Team Commander, Uniform Division Commander, and Assistant Chief of Police. He was appointed Chief of Police in 2010. Throughout his years of service, Chief Dove continued to improve his skills through hours of specialized law enforcement training. He has received training for Advanced Incident Command, Special Weapons and Tactics, Tactical Command, and as a Certified Crime Scene Investigator. He completed the Indiana Police Chief's Executive Course and is a graduate of the 223rd Session of the FBI National Academy. Upon taking the helm of the Brownsburg Police Department, Chief Dove met with his staff to reevaluate every facet of the department. New philosophies were put in place, and the department increased efficiency and productivity. Most importantly, the department has significantly improved its relationship with the local community. The annual Night Out Against Crime has realized increased participation and standing in the community each year since Chief Dove's initial involvement many years ago. I have been fortunate to know and work with Chief Dove for many years. I know I can always rely on him and his officers to ensure public events in Brownsburg are safe for everyone in attendance. Late last year I hosted a school safety summit, and knew even before a draft agenda was completed, that Chief Dove should be the Keynote Speaker. I consider him a friend and to me and the entire Brownsburg community. Chief Dove has been a selfless public servant for over 25 years and the good people of our community appreciate those years of service. Thank you Chief Dove, for a job well done and I wish you well in your post-retirement endeavors.

While attending school, Mr. Tsakopoulos supported himself as a real estate salesman, foreshadowing his highly successful career in real estate development. Mr. Tsakopoulos founded AKT Development Corporation in Sacramento, California, which became a leading real estate developer in the area under his leadership and has built tens of thousands of homes and more than 30 million square feet of office space. Mr. Tsakopoulos and his family have also been dedicated supporters of civic and community causes. The Tsakopoulos family has donated land and funds to cultural institutions including the Greek Orthodox Church, the Crocker Art Museum, and the Roseville Arts Center. Mr. Tsakopoulos has also had a strong commitment to supporting education through the Angelo and Sofia Tsakopoulos Endowment Fund and as a co-chair for California State University, Sacramento's Capital Campaign.

EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of texas in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize the life and sacrifice of a man who served his country and the city of Dallas humbly for over thirty years. On July 7, 2016, Michael Smith was the first of five Dallas public officers who were fatally shot during a protest in downtown Dallas. The shooting was a calculated and senseless act of violence intended to tear our community apart. Instead, our community has rallied to support Michael Smith's loved ones, and honor his legacy. Michael Smith's strong, humble, and loving life is the perfect representation of Dallas' resilience in times of duress. Smith worked in the Dallas Police Department for over twenty-five years. During his time in the department, he gained a reputation for doing thorough and dependable work. He was recognized multiple times throughout his career, most notably winning the distinguished honor of being called the ``Cops' Cop.'' The only thing that outweighed his work ethic at the department was his easygoing and affable manner. Prior to joining the Dallas Police Department, Smith served seven years as an Army Ranger, where he developed a strong sense of service and an unparalleled dedication to helping others. Though Smith's record of public service is incredible, he was best known for his role in the community. On Sundays, he acted as a uniformed guard at the Watermark Church in [[Page E1148]] Farmers Branch. There, he charmed children every Sunday by showing them his squad car or telling them dry but easy jokes. People at the church were both protected and entertained by Smith. He is survived by his wife, a Catholic school teacher whom he met teaching racquetball to deserving youth at a YMCA, as well as their two beautiful daughters. Mr. Speaker, the shooting in Dallas is a tragedy of enormous proportions. However, the impact Michael Smith made to the Dallas community and his loved ones is far bigger. Today, we honor his life. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1147-E1148] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND SACRIFICE OF MICHAEL SMITH ______ HON.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the three bills designed to weaken or undermine the nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the IAEA, which conducts thorough, systematic and regular evaluations of Iran's nuclear energy activities, Iran is complying with its obligations under the JCPOA. The core of the Arak plutonium reactor was dismantled and destroyed, 19,000 centrifuges were put under close IAEA surveillance and 98 percent of Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium was removed out of the country. As long as Iran continues to fulfill its commitments, it is important that the U.S. not jeopardize the accord by abandoning its own. That is why these bills are so reckless. H.R. 5631 requires the re-imposition of sanctions on individuals and entities that were delisted on Implementation Day; H.R. 4992 reapplies secondary sanctions on Iran's financial sector by prohibiting permissible financial transactions between Iran and the international community that are outside the U.S. financial system; and, H.R. 5119 prevents the U.S. from procuring heavy water from Iran. The United States does not produce heavy water so American industries and labs which need nuclear material for research must seek out international sources. This bill will cut American companies off from that important resource while also forcing Iran to sell its heavy water on the international market, where it can fall into dangerous hands. The JCPOA is working. It has disassembled key elements of Iran's nuclear program and subjects the Iranians to unprecedented verification and monitoring requirements. As a result, all of Iran's pathways to a weapon have been blocked and the U.S. and our allies are safer. Taken together, these bills will require the U.S. to re-impose sanctions on Iran in violation of our obligation under the agreement to ``refrain from any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran.'' The JCPOA does not threaten U.S. foreign policy objectives. It does not require the U.S. to abandon its sanctions on Iran for its human rights abuses or terrorist activities. Those sanctions were not affected by the JCPOA in any way. The U.S. also retains its right to target Iran's ballistic missiles activities and to penalize Iran for its destabilizing regional activities. Before the U.S. signed the agreement, the world was a significantly less safe place. Iran had thousands of centrifuges spinning to increase its large stockpile of enriched uranium and Iran was only two to three months away from developing a bomb. When the JCPOA was signed, Iran agreed to ship tens of thousands of pounds of enriched uranium out of the country, two-thirds of Iran's centrifuges were dismantled or removed, and the international community was provided unprecedented access to Iran's nuclear facilities and supply chain. These bills are not tough; they are foolish. They could recklessly endanger the security gains we have made as a result of the JCPOA. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1148] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REGARDING H.R. 5631, H.R. 4992 AND H.R. 5119 ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a plague wreaking havoc on our nation . . . a sickness that brings in its wake the death of innocent children in communities all across the United States . . . mass shootings in our elementary schools, on our playgrounds, in our homes, stores, restaurants, and places of work. Innocent people are being slaughtered by criminals using military style weapons. . . . like the ruthless killer who shot and killed 49 young kids out having fun at a disco in my congressional district in Orlando, Florida. Few countries make it easier than the United States for someone to buy an assault weapon to kill their victims in a matter of minutes. The horrific massacre in Orlando is only the latest example, and Mr. Mateen was able to kill so many people mainly because the assault rifle he was using could fire 30-round clips as fast as he could pull the trigger. No civilian anywhere should be allowed to have that ability. These types of weapons should be reserved only for our brave men and women in the military. And so I take to the House floor once again, to demand that the House majority allow a vote on commonsense gun violence prevention legislation. Although not a cure all, we need to do all we can to help keep military type assault weapons out of dangerous hands so mass killings like the one that took place just last month in my district, which was, incidentally, the worst mass shooting in our nation's history, never happens again. Month after month--Republicans in the House of Representatives have refused to increase funding to combat a dangerous public health crisis that is already hitting our country, and that has already arrived in my State of Florida: Zika virus. Along with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Florida congressional delegation, I am imploring the House of Representatives to consider fully funding efforts to combat this horrible disease. Indeed, over 250 people in the State of Florida have been diagnosed with Zika, including 43 pregnant women. This virus is not only a threat to our health and the health of pregnant mothers, but also to our economy and our everyday lives. And shifting funds from one public health crisis like Ebola, to another, is absolutely NOT an acceptable solution. If we do not act immediately, we will see more and more babies born with Zika virus, and trying to figure out why Congress did not do more to help them. Congress needs to immediately provide the funding necessary for mosquito eradication, vaccine research, and our local community health centers so they can provide screenings and comprehensive health services. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1148] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN VIOLENCE AND ZIKA ______ HON.

Alice's parents immigrated from County Antrim and County Longford, Ireland to Queens, New York where they raised a strong-willed Irishwoman with a sharp sense of humor. At age 20, she met Charles Moore and they married a few weeks later in the Upper West side of Manhattan at the Roman Catholic Church of the Ascension.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a constituent of mine, Marine Private First Class Giles McCoy, and the rest of the USS Indianapolis crew who were on board before the ship was tragically sunk on July 30, 1945 just after midnight. Of the 1,196 members who were on board, 900 were able to make it into the water. The men floated in the water while at the mercy of the sharks lurking beneath them. The Captain of the ship was not alerted that there were enemies in the water due to the fact that his ship was carrying crucial parts for the atomic bomb. The crew was sure that they would be rescued after they did not show at their destination; however, due to the secrecy of the mission, the Navy did no such thing. Slowly, the men perished in the water due to lack of hydration and the merciless shark attacks that kept on coming. Out of the 900 men who made it into the water, only 317 made it out alive. They were accidently spotted by Lieutenant Gwinn while he was on patrol in an airplane. This event happened four days after the ship sunk. They were rescued after five. Tragically, the Navy court martialed Captain McVay for not taking precautions like zig zagging his ship to avoid enemy fire; however, he was not made aware of the possible enemies lurking nearby the vessel. Captain McVay was shamed publically for being responsible for the deaths of his crew. He was a recipient of so much hate mail that he tragically committed suicide in 1968. He was seventy years old. The surviving crew has publically said that they do not believe the Captain was at fault, and in 1999 a hearing was held with a survivor, in the Senate. One survivor, Cleatus Lebow, said at the hearing that Captain McVay was unjustly court martialed. His name was cleared with a Senate resolution in the year 2000. In 2001, the Secretary of the Navy ordered Captain McVay's record to be cleared. The brave crewmembers inspired many movies like Men of Courage that was released in 2016. I stand here today to honor my constituent who survived the sinking, Marine Private First Class Giles McCoy. I honor all of the crew that perished and those who survived. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1149] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MARINE PRIVATE FIRST CLASS GILES McCOY AND THE USS ``INDIANAPOLIS'' CREW ______ HON.

McCALL, COMMANDING OFFICER OF NAVAL STATION MAYPORT","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1149] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING CAPTAIN WESLEY R. McCALL, COMMANDING OFFICER OF NAVAL STATION MAYPORT ______ HON. ANDER CRENSHAW of florida in the house of representatives Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Captain Wesley R. McCall, the Commanding Officer of Naval Station Mayport in Jacksonville, Florida, on a job well done. Captain McCall has served the Navy and our Jacksonville community with dedication and distinction for the last three years and will continue his military service in Washington with the Naval Installations Command. Capt. McCall served at NS Mayport during a time of numerous construction projects and increases in the number of ships and sailors at the station, all of which added to the challenges of providing superb quality support to the Fleet, families and warfighters. In order to accomplish these tasks, he managed the Naval Station Mayport Shore Installation Planning Board that solicited tenant command inputs in a comprehensive review of facilities requirements for planning and prioritization of MILCON and Special Project Program successes. A few of the events and projects that were authorized by Congress and completed during Captain McCall's tenure include the opening of the $26.5 million Fitness Center project in October 2013, and the completion of the Littoral Support Facility, which is the first of several facilities constructed in support of the new Littoral Combat Ship Program, which is headquartered on the East Coast at Mayport. Additionally, $26.5 million in repairs and upgrades to Charlie Wharf has resulted in the station's first double-decker wharf. Capt. McCall and his staff welcomed 2000 sailors and their families as the Amphibious Readiness Group, that includes the USS Iwo Jima, USS Fort McHenry, and USS New York, was homeported in Mayport in August 2014. He also successfully hosted the highly visible first East Coast visit of the People's Liberation Army Navy's visit to NS Mayport from China. Within the community, Capt. McCall was a champion for the Navy and of the Beaches area. He was the lead representative from five military services and 15 municipalities in the 2015 Jacksonville Sea and Sky Spectacular Air Show. The event, highlighting 26 aircraft, afforded more than half a million local residents of the Navy's third largest fleet concentration area a unique view of naval aviation highlighted by the Blue Angels. His unwavering support of three Porsche Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance events generated for the first time more than $100,000 in donations to the Navy and Marine Corps Relief Society. Wes also served on the Beaches Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, and he and his wife Reyna were very active with the USO. They both attended every No Dough Dinner in order to help serve meals to sailors and their families. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and Members of the House to join me in thanking Captain McCall for his leadership and his service at Naval Station Mayport and wish him and his wife fair winds and following seas as they transition to Washington, DC. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 115 (Friday, July 15, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1149] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING CAPTAIN WESLEY R.

Mr. Speaker, I stand in solidarity with my colleagues to demand commonsense legislation to address the epidemic of gun violence in America. Last week, I spoke on the House Floor in memory of Coral Wilson, a mother of 8 who was shot and killed on May 11, 2016 in Birmingham, Alabama by a domestic abuser. The shooter broke into the home of Ms. Wilson, and used a gun to murder her and shoot four of her children. Ms. Wilson was the 7th domestic gun violence homicide victim and the 41st gun violence homicide victim in Birmingham this year--Mr. Speaker, these deaths were never acknowledged by a moment of silence on the House Floor. Congress has repeatedly failed to pass commonsense gun safety measures that would protect our communities. Too much blood has been shed and we need action. We need stronger laws that prevent gun violence and we need it now. Make no mistake--strengthening background checks, eliminating gun show loopholes, and preventing potential terrorists and criminals from acquiring assault weapons will not limit the rights of lawful gun owners to protect and defend themselves. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., while sitting in a Birmingham, Alabama jail, wrote, ``injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''
