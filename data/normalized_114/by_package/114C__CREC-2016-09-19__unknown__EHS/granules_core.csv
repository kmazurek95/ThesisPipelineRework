Roland Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise in honor of Kentucky's bravest young men, one of whom, Capt. Matthew D. Roland, of Lexington, KY, gave his life in service to our country on August 26, 2015. Captain Roland was a proud airman and member of the 23rd Special Tactics [[Page S5872]] Squadron in Hurlburt Field, FL. He was 27 years old. Captain Roland was killed in combat at Camp Antonik in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. He was driving the lead vehicle in a convoy when that convoy was attacked by enemy combatants dressed as friendly Afghan forces. It was a complex attack. The first warning that something was wrong came when an enemy combatant approached Captain Roland's vehicle. When he was within 5 feet of the vehicle, he began to raise his weapon. Without hesitation, Captain Roland's first thoughts were for the safety of his fellow servicemembers. He yelled ``Insider attack'' while radioing a warning to all vehicles in the convoy. Simultaneously, he drove in reverse, away from the gunmen, to protect his passengers. Tragically, a split second later, the lead gunman who had approached the vehicle, shot Captain Roland, instantly killing him, but the message he had conveyed over the radio gave the other personnel in his convoy the opportunity to take cover and ready their weapons. Because of his warning, American casualties were fewer and the enemy combatants were neutralized, including the one who killed Captain Roland. For his actions, Captain Roland was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for Valor. The citation accompanying the award read: Captain Roland's actions are in keeping with the finest traditions of military heroism and reflect distinct credit upon himself, the NATO Special Operations Component Command . . . and the United States Air Force. Over the course of his military career, Captain Roland received several other awards, medals, and declarations, including the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Force Achievement Medal, Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, National Defense Service Medal, and NATO Medal. Captain Roland was born at Ellsworth Air Force Base in Rapid City, SD. His father, retired U.S. Air Force Col. Mark Roland, moved frequently for assignments, and Matthew grew up in Abilene, TX, and Albuquerque, NM, before the family settled in Lexington, KY, where Matthew attended Lexington Catholic High School. In high school, it was clear to many that Matthew was a driven young man who knew what he wanted out of life. Tim Wiesenhahn, his cross- country coach at Lexington Catholic, remembered that. Tim said: He really wanted to be successful. I like to say he was driven to succeed. You just kind of knew he was going to be a leader. . . . The best runners really work at it, and Matt really wanted to be successful, and he put in the work. A friend of Matthew's from high school, Clint Roberts, saw the same determination in the future airman. He said: I don't remember a time when Matt didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. From the time we met at cross- country practice in high school until the last time I talked to him, Matt always seemed like he controlled his life and path in a way that everyone strives to. Matthew attained the Eagle Scout rank in Boy Scouting and graduated from Lexington Catholic in 2006. He entered the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO, where he graduated in 2010 with a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering. Matthew then completed the rigorous special tactics program in 2012 to become a special tactics officer. As an STO, he was a team leader who supervised combat preparedness training for a 35-member team. He was a military static line and free-fall parachutist, Air Force combat scuba diver, and a joint terminal attack controller. He led reconnaissance, strike, and recovery missions. He was deployed three times over his 5 years of service in the Air Force, twice to Afghanistan and once to Africa, and wherever he served, he gained a reputation as a rock during stressful times, always cool under pressure yet always easy to befriend. Capt. Ben Self, a fellow special tactics officer, said: The attribute that stood out to me most was his unflinching stoic presence when we needed it most. I relied on Matt when times were toughest, and I will continue to do so as his memory lives on through all of us. ``Matt was anything but typical,'' says Col. Paul Brister, his commander. ``On the battlefield, he was a lion--lethal, precise, humble and compassionate. He was always flawless. I'm convinced I learned more from him than he could ever learn from me.'' Another airman said of Matthew: ``He was unquestionably our leader . . . not just by the [regulations] or rank, but through his ability to command our respect and trust as men.'' A letter written to Matthew's parents after his death revealed what Matthew did when off duty. ``Besides Matt's great qualities as a teammate, air commando and USAF officer, Matt has two memorable habits,'' wrote LTC John Sannes and CSM Dwight Utley. The letter continued: He loved to walk around in his American flag shorts, and he loved his mom's chocolate chip cookies. As a testimony to Matt's generous heart, he burned his legs helping a contractor weld a gate while wearing his flag shorts, and he always shared his cookies with the guys on his team. Matthew's loved ones are foremost in our thoughts as I share his story with my Senate colleagues and the entire Nation today. They include his parents, Colonel Mark and Barbara Roland; his sister, Erica Roland; his niece, Willamina Roland; his grandparents, Dr. and Mrs. Earl Roland; his grandmother, Rita Thomas; and many other beloved family members and friends. Matthew's final resting place is Arlington National Cemetery, not far from where we stand. He was buried with full military honors. One of Matthew's fellow airmen said this about hearing of his death: [Matthew] brought America to the tent flaps and mud walls of our enemies on two continents. . . . He did not compromise on what he believed, and the nation is lucky he spent his time and energy protecting her. I couldn't agree more. I am sure my colleagues agree that America is indeed lucky to have had Capt. Matthew D. Roland fighting for our freedoms. I would like his family to know that the Members of the Senate honor his service and his sacrifice and will be forever grateful. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S5871-S5872] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES Captain Matthew D.

Simultaneously, he drove in reverse, away from the gunmen, to protect his passengers. Tragically, a split second later, the lead gunman who had approached the vehicle, shot Captain Roland, instantly killing him, but the message he had conveyed over the radio gave the other personnel in his convoy the opportunity to take cover and ready their weapons. Because of his warning, American casualties were fewer and the enemy combatants were neutralized, including the one who killed Captain Roland. For his actions, Captain Roland was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for Valor. The citation accompanying the award read: Captain Roland's actions are in keeping with the finest traditions of military heroism and reflect distinct credit upon himself, the NATO Special Operations Component Command . . . and the United States Air Force. Over the course of his military career, Captain Roland received several other awards, medals, and declarations, including the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Force Achievement Medal, Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, National Defense Service Medal, and NATO Medal. Captain Roland was born at Ellsworth Air Force Base in Rapid City, SD. His father, retired U.S. Air Force Col. Mark Roland, moved frequently for assignments, and Matthew grew up in Abilene, TX, and Albuquerque, NM, before the family settled in Lexington, KY, where Matthew attended Lexington Catholic High School. In high school, it was clear to many that Matthew was a driven young man who knew what he wanted out of life. Tim Wiesenhahn, his cross- country coach at Lexington Catholic, remembered that. Tim said: He really wanted to be successful. I like to say he was driven to succeed. You just kind of knew he was going to be a leader. . . . The best runners really work at it, and Matt really wanted to be successful, and he put in the work. A friend of Matthew's from high school, Clint Roberts, saw the same determination in the future airman. He said: I don't remember a time when Matt didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. From the time we met at cross- country practice in high school until the last time I talked to him, Matt always seemed like he controlled his life and path in a way that everyone strives to. Matthew attained the Eagle Scout rank in Boy Scouting and graduated from Lexington Catholic in 2006. He entered the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO, where he graduated in 2010 with a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering. Matthew then completed the rigorous special tactics program in 2012 to become a special tactics officer. As an STO, he was a team leader who supervised combat preparedness training for a 35-member team. He was a military static line and free-fall parachutist, Air Force combat scuba diver, and a joint terminal attack controller. He led reconnaissance, strike, and recovery missions. He was deployed three times over his 5 years of service in the Air Force, twice to Afghanistan and once to Africa, and wherever he served, he gained a reputation as a rock during stressful times, always cool under pressure yet always easy to befriend. Capt. Ben Self, a fellow special tactics officer, said: The attribute that stood out to me most was his unflinching stoic presence when we needed it most. I relied on Matt when times were toughest, and I will continue to do so as his memory lives on through all of us. ``Matt was anything but typical,'' says Col. Paul Brister, his commander. ``On the battlefield, he was a lion--lethal, precise, humble and compassionate. He was always flawless. I'm convinced I learned more from him than he could ever learn from me.'' Another airman said of Matthew: ``He was unquestionably our leader . . . not just by the [regulations] or rank, but through his ability to command our respect and trust as men.'' A letter written to Matthew's parents after his death revealed what Matthew did when off duty. ``Besides Matt's great qualities as a teammate, air commando and USAF officer, Matt has two memorable habits,'' wrote LTC John Sannes and CSM Dwight Utley. The letter continued: He loved to walk around in his American flag shorts, and he loved his mom's chocolate chip cookies. As a testimony to Matt's generous heart, he burned his legs helping a contractor weld a gate while wearing his flag shorts, and he always shared his cookies with the guys on his team. Matthew's loved ones are foremost in our thoughts as I share his story with my Senate colleagues and the entire Nation today. They include his parents, Colonel Mark and Barbara Roland; his sister, Erica Roland; his niece, Willamina Roland; his grandparents, Dr. and Mrs. Earl Roland; his grandmother, Rita Thomas; and many other beloved family members and friends. Matthew's final resting place is Arlington National Cemetery, not far from where we stand. He was buried with full military honors. One of Matthew's fellow airmen said this about hearing of his death: [Matthew] brought America to the tent flaps and mud walls of our enemies on two continents. . . . He did not compromise on what he believed, and the nation is lucky he spent his time and energy protecting her. I couldn't agree more. I am sure my colleagues agree that America is indeed lucky to have had Capt. Matthew D. Roland fighting for our freedoms. I would like his family to know that the Members of the Senate honor his service and his sacrifice and will be forever grateful.

The legislative clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 516, H.R. 5325, a bill making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Zika Virus Funding Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we have a bit of good news because earlier today the CDC, or the Centers for Disease Control, announced that it had lifted its travel advisory to not go into a section north of downtown Miami called Wynwood. It is the neighborhood where the first locally transmitted Zika virus was found. So the fact that they said today that this area is no longer considered an area of active transmission is certainly good news, not only for those who live there but for those businesses that are dependent on those who are planning to visit there. That is just one area of Florida. There are now 835 active cases of Zika-infected people in the State of Florida. If you compare that to the number for the total United States, talking about infections, in 49 of the 50 States, it is 3,132. If you add our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico and the territories, fellow American citizens, 17,315 are infected with the Zika virus. In Florida, 86 pregnant women are infected with the Zika virus. The total in the Nation is 731. In Puerto Rico--primarily there, although bringing in all the territories, it is 1,156. Combining Puerto Rico, the territories, and the United States, we are talking about close to 2,000 pregnant women infected with the Zika virus. We know that the CDC has said that there is anywhere from a 1-percent to 12-percent chance--if a woman is infected in the first trimester of pregnancy, there is a 1- to 12-percent chance that her baby will be born with defects. If you do the math on the nearly 2,000 pregnant women, we are talking about a substantial number of birth defects, including the possibility of what we have heard about and seen-- microcephaly, babies with a deformed brain and shrunken head. In Puerto Rico they already had one live birth of microcephaly and they had one who did not live after birth. We can expect to see huge numbers coming on down the line. That is all the more reason for us--since we started our request for funding last spring--to get at this by doing a Zika vaccine. It is now ready to go into the FDA first trials. A vaccine is at least 2 years away, but we have to get started, and that costs money. The administration has been robbing Peter to pay Paul, finding every little pot of money that it can borrow from since last spring in order to try to fund the preventive measures of a vaccine, mosquito control, and all the attendant health expenditures through our health care centers that are sponsored and paid for by the government, and particularly for the very poor. As a matter of fact, the government raided the Ebola fund of $576 million to advance it to Zika. Well, we need to pay back all of those funds that were raided, and that is incumbent upon us now here at the last minute before we adjourn to go home to campaign before the election. You know, those words are suddenly similar to the words we used in early July, trying to get that done before the summer recess for the political conventions. Yet we did not. The good news is that it looks as though there is now an agreement on Zika. As a result, we can come up with a funding bill to keep the government open until we can pass a permanent funding bill for this fiscal year starting October 1. We will pass a temporary one until sometime in early December. That will give us a chance to try to do the permanent one. In the meantime, the government has to stay open. We have to fund the functions of government, including national security and the U.S. Department of Defense. So one would think that this bill would be all done, but, unrelated to Zika, there are other issues that are threatening the funding bill. At the end of the day, we will get it done. Some of the issues are over as arcane a subject as who is going to administer the issuance of domain names on the Internet. There seems to be some controversy over that. As a result, we are here at the last minute, at the last [[Page S5874]] hour, having to act on a funding bill, and now we have issues that are now all wound around the axle again. I want to say very positively that I appreciate the progress that is being made on the Zika funding. It is not as if we haven't tried this before. Last May we had a bill that passed in a bipartisan fashion for $1.1 billion that did not have the attached political riders. It passed in the Senate by 89 votes out of 100 Senators. Then, of course, the bill in the House of Representatives got all wound up with all kinds of political messaging. I want to state very positively that I am very happy that it seems as if those issues have been put aside and there has been an agreement reached. Now let's get through the rest of this on the funding bill and go ahead and execute our responsibilities that we have to the United States of America. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Tribute to Emogene Stegall Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to praise the work of a local elected official in Florida who has admirably served as supervisor of elections in Lake County, FL. This is an elected position in which she has now served for 44 years, and she is going to retire from her position as the chief elections officer after this upcoming election in November. That is an incredible tenure of public service, and Emogene Stegall should be commended for being the longtime supervisor of elections. ``Emogene'' is a name that is almost synonymous with ``Lake County'' because she has been an elected official for nearly half a century. What is so special about her is not only how many years she has held the office but how she embodied the details and the ideals of public service. Since she was first elected in 1972, a lot has changed about the way elections are conducted, but through all of those decades, the same fundamental principles have guided Emogene Stegall's work: a dedication to treating all voters fairly without any regard for party affiliation and safeguarding taxpayer dollars--no partisan politics, no attention- grabbing headlines, just humble public service. Before being elected supervisor, Emogene had already worked 14 years as the supervisor's deputy, starting in 1958. At that time there were only about 17,000 registered voters in Lake County and a handful of voting machines. Most of it was done by paper ballot. Her office used typewriters and carbon paper to function, and voting results were announced on the radio. Fast-forward to today. Emogene has been reelected many times over since winning her first election in 1972, and the number of registered voters in the county has gone from 17,000 to over 200,000. Now the supervisor's office is filled with computers, and computer programs tally the votes on election day before publishing them on the Internet so the voters receive almost instant results. Even with all these changes, Emogene is still there, opening her office to constituents of all political stripes and working long hours to make sure election day runs smoothly and that all citizens in Lake County can exercise their constitutional right to vote. Her principled approach to fulfilling her responsibilities explains why she has continued to be reelected to her post time and time again even though she is a registered Democrat in a county that shifted to Republican control long ago. The changes Emogene has witnessed run deeper than the office equipment and the party politics. When she was first elected, Lake County, along with much of the South of the United States, was still suffering from the scourge of Jim Crowe. African Americans in particular were often denied the right to vote. Even after the civil rights legislation was passed in the 1960s, the country still needed public servants to implement the law without prejudice in order to usher in change and combat racism. Emogene's steadfast commitment to ensuring the people's right to vote helped achieve that transformation and in a way brings our Nation closer to realizing the ideal of equality that we have reached and have tried to reach since our founding. It is also notable that Emogene Stegall served as the first woman elected official and community leader at a time when women's educational and professional opportunities were much more limited than today. After so many decades of public service, Emogene will oversee her last election day this November. But her legacy for being a committed and tireless public servant will continue to be remembered. She has used her position to benefit the community she was elected to serve. She never was elected, nor used it, for herself or her own interests. Emogene Stegall is an example for all of us in public service. So I am honored to share her story and acknowledge her accomplishments on this occasion today on the floor of the Senate as Emogene Stegall will conduct and is preparing for her last election as Supervisor of Elections. What a great public service. What a great public servant whom we can honor today. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the weekend, we were reminded once again of the threat that terrorism poses to our communities all across this country. I know we are all grateful the explosions that occurred in New Jersey and Manhattan and the knife attack in Minnesota did not hurt more people. I am thankful for the authorities, the law enforcement officials, the emergency medical officials and others who have responded so heroically. I am grateful there has already been a suspect detained in the New York and New Jersey incident before he could attempt additional attacks. This is just another reminder, as if we needed more reminders, of the importance of remaining vigilant to the threat of terrorism in the United States. Our values and our way of life seem to be under near constant attack, certainly under constant threat. We have a responsibility to do everything we can within our power to support and protect those affected by the evil of terrorism within our borders. Last week, the Senate sent a piece of legislation, an important piece of legislation from my perspective, called the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act to President Obama for his signature. He has until Friday to act on it. I want to clarify for my colleagues exactly what is contained in this legislation because I have heard from some stories that make me think they are being misled by some but also maybe there is just some confusion I can help clear up. This legislation, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or sometimes called the 9/11 families bill, makes some narrow amendments to a longstanding Federal statute, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and the anti-terrorism act. What it does provide is for Americans to be able to seek recourse in a court of law from governments or people who sponsor terrorist attacks on American soil. You would think that would not be particularly controversial. Put another way, this bill does not allow a lawsuit to proceed against a foreign nation unless they are alleged to have been behind a terror attack on American soil. As I said, this is pretty straightforward, which is why it passed the Senate and the House unanimously. I want to be clear what the bill does and does not do. First of all, the legislation does not single out any particular country for some kind of unfair treatment. It stands for the simple proposition that Americans should have recourse against those involved in terrorist attacks on our homeland, just as they do against others who commit other wrongs. I have had some of my colleagues say: Yes, but perception is reality. Well, misperception is not reality. The fact is, there is no country mentioned in the legislation, this extension of existing law. To the extent it singles out anybody, it only singles out countries, without naming any, that fund terrorists who commit terrorism on our soil. Some have suggested this could hurt our relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in particular. This bill has nothing to do, on its face, with our [[Page S5875]] strong partnership with Saudi Arabia, which is based on mutual interests. The reality is, the nuclear deal struck by President Obama involving the country of Iran has done far more to damage our relationship with our allies in the Middle East, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It has caused many of our allies, not just the Saudis but others in the Middle East, to question whether we are a reliable ally in the areas where we do share a common interest. We know many of our Gulf State allies, including the Saudis, believe the President has not done enough to achieve his own stated goal of defeating the terrorist army of ISIS, which threatens Saudi Arabia from Iraq, just across its northern border. Quite to the contrary, we know President Obama ignored the advice of his own military advisers and unwisely withdrew all combat forces from Iraq in a precipitous way before that country was ready and able to defend itself, only to see ISIS rush in and fill the vacuum left after the departure of American leadership and ground forces. The bottom line is that this legislation should not upset our relationships with any country with which we share common interests, including the Saudis. They should not take passage of this legislation as a reason to somehow question our commitment to an alliance based on shared values or shared interests. This bill targets those who fund terrorist activity against us--plain and simple. I should also add that all this bill does is to give victims an opportunity to have their case heard in court. It doesn't decide the merits of the case. It simply gives them an avenue for justice. Second, I want to debunk this idea that somehow the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act will suddenly result in lawsuits being filed against Americans by foreign governments. The reality is this already happens. We have an entire office at the Justice Department--the Office of Foreign Litigation--that defends the United States in foreign courts. As its Web site explains, that litigation includes ``litigation arising from U.S. agency or military activities in foreign countries,'' which is one reason why, before we pulled out all of our troops from Iraq, President Obama and his administration should have done a better job pursuing a status of forces agreement with the country of Iraq. But because they did not negotiate that, they decided to pull out, and we have reaped the whirlwind as a result. While likely a minority, there are cases, in fact, brought abroad that implicate our own overseas activity. For example, in 2010, CBS News reported on a case in Pakistan in which the CIA was sued for an alleged drone strike. This is a matter of public record that CBS News reported. The point is that today foreign governments allow suits against the United States from time to time, and they are defended based on international law and based on the merits of the case. That is because of their legal systems and domestic politics. Our laws are simply not consulted as a determining factor. Why would a foreign country apply American law or precedent or procedure? But let me also make clear: The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act makes only modest changes to current foreign sovereign immunity laws--laws that have already been passed by the U.S. Congress--and it has been written in a narrow manner to prevent such suits should any reciprocal law be passed. Finally, I remind my colleagues that this legislation was crafted and created through consensus. Before the Senate passed it several months ago, my colleagues and I took great care to address concerns from Members on both sides of the aisle, as you would expect. Working with other Members, we made changes to the legislation they requested so we could keep support for this legislation and support for the families of victims strong. It then unanimously passed the Senate in May. Over in the House, it passed without dissent. I have to say that it is hard to find any piece of legislation that can pass unanimously in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. It just doesn't happen very often. But even with so much bipartisan, bicameral support, President Obama still says he intends to veto the legislation. As I have said before, that is his prerogative, but I hope he does so soon so that Congress has the opportunity to vote to override his veto. Once he does veto it, I hope Congress will quickly act. I have been reminded of a passage in Henry Kissinger's book called ``World Order,'' where he talks about how the West, in particular, often views the world as an orderly rules-based system. Of course, the problem with that is reality. The world does not all acknowledge a rules-based system, no matter who imagines it. Other countries will take actions based on what they perceive to advance their own interests, not because they just want to follow a certain set of rules that somebody else wrote up. That will remain true for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia even after the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act becomes law. That is why our relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will continue, because they have been fighting terrorism on their own soil and we know that we share other interests as well. But at the end of the day, we need to do what is right for the American people, just as other countries would do right for their own citizens. We should not change our domestic laws because of our concerns about other countries perhaps being offended or because they have other interests other than what we are trying to vindicate here, which are the rights of the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 due to a terrorist attack on American soil. They should have the opportunity to make their case if they can, and nothing in this judges the merits of the case or makes any conclusion about whether they will be successful or not. But, certainly, they represent part of the American people who we work for, and they are entitled to get access to the courts for the purpose of making the case if they can. This bill sends a clear signal to every country that the United States is not afraid to stand and ensure that our countrymen and countrywomen have the ability to pursue justice here in our courts. That is nonnegotiable. I hope the President will act quickly. The President can string this out into next week if he wants, but he has already said he is going to veto it. So why put the families through any more delay, anguish, and uncertainty? The President should go ahead and veto the legislation. Then the Senate and the House of Representatives should take up a veto override vote. I am confident of what the outcome of that would be, based on the unanimous consent to the bill in the Senate and the unanimous vote in the House of Representatives. Madam President, I don't see any other Senator interested in speaking. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 5985 Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5985; further, that there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form; that following the use or yielding back of time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to H.R. 5325 ripen at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, September 20. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

Without objection, it is so ordered. [[Page S5876]] Recognizing the United States Air Force Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I rise to recognize the U.S. Air Force on the occasion of its 69th birthday. On September 18, 1947, President Truman signed the National Security Act, which established the U.S. Air Force as an independent service equal to the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. The mission of the U.S. Air Force is to fly, fight, and win in airspace and cyberspace, and Colorado is proud to call itself home to units that play a vital role in executing all aspects of the Air Force mission. Although it is the youngest of the armed services, the Air Force has accomplished a tremendous amount--a tremendous amount--in those 69 years. With a combined force strength of more than 660,000 Active, Reserve, National Guard, and civilian personnel within the U.S. Air Force, it is a force to be reckoned with. The U.S. Air Force's ability to maintain air superiority is evidenced by the fact that the last time an American ground troop was killed by ordnance delivered from an enemy aircraft was in 1953. On any given day, there are more than 21,000 Air Force personnel deployed to 179 worldwide locations, 16,000 airmen deployed to the CENTCOM area of operations, and more than 1,000 airmen working directly with partner nations. While American airmen serve all over the world, there are thousands of airmen in my State of Colorado protecting our Nation's interests. Colorado is home to five major Air Force installations that include Buckley Air Force Base, Schriever Air Force Base, Peterson Air Force Base, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, and the United States Air Force Academy. Buckley Air Force Base is home to the 460th Space Wing and has air operations, space-based missile warning capabilities, space surveillance operations, space communications operations, and support functions. If North Korea, Iran, or any adversary fires a missile at the U.S. homeland, Buckley would be the first to see it. Buckley is also one of 18 bases nationwide being considered by the Air Force to host the next-generation F-35 jet, and it is my firm belief it fully merits that designation as well. Peterson Air Force Base, named after 1st Lt. Edward J. Peterson, a Colorado native, has been in operation since 1926. Over its 90-plus years, Peterson Air Force Base has served a variety of operational and training missions and is currently home to the 21st Space Wing and Air Force Space Command as well. Peterson is also home to the U.S. Northern Command--NORTHCOM--and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD. NORAD-NORTHCOM is responsible for protecting the U.S. homeland from the myriad of threats we face in today's complex global security environment. On a day like today, when we reflect on what happened in Minnesota, when we reflect on what happened in New Jersey, and when we reflect on what happened in New York, we know that efforts to protect our homeland are critically important. In a recent letter to the President, several colleagues and I expressed grave concerns about the rapid advancement of North Korea's nuclear ballistic missile program. That regime represents a grave threat to global peace and stability and is a direct threat to the U.S. homeland--and that is what our bases in Colorado are responsible for. While we in Congress urge the President to take actions to counter the North Korean threat, the American people rely on the hard-working men and women at NORAD-NORTHCOM to protect us from this rogue regime. Just down the road from Peterson Air Force Base is Schriever Air Force Base, which is home to the 50th Space Wing of the Air Force Space Command. Schriever provides command and control for over 170 Department of Defense warning, navigational, and communications satellites. The global positioning satellite, or GPS, is operated by the 2nd Space Operations Squadron at Schriever. If you successfully use your Google Maps today, it is because of the good work by the satellite operators at Schriever. Schriever is home to the Joint Interagency Space Operations Center, or JICSpOC. Established in 2015, the JICSpOC consolidates efforts between the DOD, U.S. Strategic Command, and the intelligence community to create unity of effort and facilitate U.S. information-sharing across the national security space enterprise. JICSpOC will enhance U.S. space operations, contribute to operational command and control within the Department of Defense, and improve the Nation's ability to protect and defend critical infrastructure in an increasingly contested space environment. Since 1966, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force, stationed in Colorado Springs, has been a synergistic hub for tracking security threats worldwide and serves as an essential component to the defense of North America and global security. Cheyenne Mountain is an engineering marvel that provides an electromagnetic pulse-hardened facility to protect our Nation's most vital interests. Many of the people around the country may know Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station as the site of Matthew Broderick in the movie ``WarGames.'' Last but not least of the major Air Force installations in Colorado is the U.S. Air Force Academy. Since the 1955 swearing-in of its first class of cadets, the Air Force Academy has been developing leaders of character to lead the world's best Air Force. The Air Force Academy educates, trains, and inspires men and women to become officers of character, motivated to lead the U.S. Air Force in service to our Nation. In addition to celebrating the Air Force's 69th birthday, I would also like to recognize that this year, 2016, is the 40th anniversary of women cadets enrolling in the U.S. Air Force Academy. Just as the Air Force leads the way as the preeminent global air power, the Air Force Academy has been leading the way with the integration of women cadets into the Cadet Wing. In 1972, the Air Force Academy issued Operational Plan 36-72, which laid the groundwork for the arrival of its first 156 female cadets in the summer of 1976. In the proceeding 40 years, women cadets and graduates have made extraordinary contributions to both the academy and to the Air Force. These contributions are exemplified by women such as Michelle Johnson, who in 1980 became the first woman cadet wing commander, which is the highest ranking cadet in the academy, and then in 1981 she became the first woman cadet to become a Rhodes scholar. In 2013, Lt. Gen. Michelle Johnson became the first female superintendent of any military service academy when she became the superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy. Heather Wilson was the first female veteran to serve in Congress. Lt. Gen. Susan J. Helms was the first woman graduate of the Air Force Academy to go into space. Lieutenant Roslyn Schulte became the first female graduate killed by enemy action in 2009. These women and countless others are why the State of Colorado is proud, honored, and humbled to host the U.S. Air Force Academy. On behalf of all Coloradoans and a grateful nation, I wish the U.S. Air Force a happy 69th birthday. Aim high, fly, fight, and win. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S5873-S5876] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017--MOTION TO PROCEED The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 5325, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 516, H.R. 5325, a bill making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Zika Virus Funding Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we have a bit of good news because earlier today the CDC, or the Centers for Disease Control, announced that it had lifted its travel advisory to not go into a section north of downtown Miami called Wynwood. It is the neighborhood where the first locally transmitted Zika virus was found. So the fact that they said today that this area is no longer considered an area of active transmission is certainly good news, not only for those who live there but for those businesses that are dependent on those who are planning to visit there. That is just one area of Florida. There are now 835 active cases of Zika-infected people in the State of Florida. If you compare that to the number for the total United States, talking about infections, in 49 of the 50 States, it is 3,132. If you add our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico and the territories, fellow American citizens, 17,315 are infected with the Zika virus. In Florida, 86 pregnant women are infected with the Zika virus. The total in the Nation is 731. In Puerto Rico--primarily there, although bringing in all the territories, it is 1,156. Combining Puerto Rico, the territories, and the United States, we are talking about close to 2,000 pregnant women infected with the Zika virus. We know that the CDC has said that there is anywhere from a 1-percent to 12-percent chance--if a woman is infected in the first trimester of pregnancy, there is a 1- to 12-percent chance that her baby will be born with defects. If you do the math on the nearly 2,000 pregnant women, we are talking about a substantial number of birth defects, including the possibility of what we have heard about and seen-- microcephaly, babies with a deformed brain and shrunken head. In Puerto Rico they already had one live birth of microcephaly and they had one who did not live after birth. We can expect to see huge numbers coming on down the line. That is all the more reason for us--since we started our request for funding last spring--to get at this by doing a Zika vaccine. It is now ready to go into the FDA first trials. A vaccine is at least 2 years away, but we have to get started, and that costs money. The administration has been robbing Peter to pay Paul, finding every little pot of money that it can borrow from since last spring in order to try to fund the preventive measures of a vaccine, mosquito control, and all the attendant health expenditures through our health care centers that are sponsored and paid for by the government, and particularly for the very poor. As a matter of fact, the government raided the Ebola fund of $576 million to advance it to Zika. Well, we need to pay back all of those funds that were raided, and that is incumbent upon us now here at the last minute before we adjourn to go home to campaign before the election. You know, those words are suddenly similar to the words we used in early July, trying to get that done before the summer recess for the political conventions. Yet we did not. The good news is that it looks as though there is now an agreement on Zika. As a result, we can come up with a funding bill to keep the government open until we can pass a permanent funding bill for this fiscal year starting October 1. We will pass a temporary one until sometime in early December. That will give us a chance to try to do the permanent one. In the meantime, the government has to stay open. We have to fund the functions of government, including national security and the U.S. Department of Defense. So one would think that this bill would be all done, but, unrelated to Zika, there are other issues that are threatening the funding bill. At the end of the day, we will get it done. Some of the issues are over as arcane a subject as who is going to administer the issuance of domain names on the Internet. There seems to be some controversy over that. As a result, we are here at the last minute, at the last [[Page S5874]] hour, having to act on a funding bill, and now we have issues that are now all wound around the axle again. I want to say very positively that I appreciate the progress that is being made on the Zika funding. It is not as if we haven't tried this before. Last May we had a bill that passed in a bipartisan fashion for $1.1 billion that did not have the attached political riders. It passed in the Senate by 89 votes out of 100 Senators. Then, of course, the bill in the House of Representatives got all wound up with all kinds of political messaging. I want to state very positively that I am very happy that it seems as if those issues have been put aside and there has been an agreement reached. Now let's get through the rest of this on the funding bill and go ahead and execute our responsibilities that we have to the United States of America. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Tribute to Emogene Stegall Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to praise the work of a local elected official in Florida who has admirably served as supervisor of elections in Lake County, FL. This is an elected position in which she has now served for 44 years, and she is going to retire from her position as the chief elections officer after this upcoming election in November. That is an incredible tenure of public service, and Emogene Stegall should be commended for being the longtime supervisor of elections. ``Emogene'' is a name that is almost synonymous with ``Lake County'' because she has been an elected official for nearly half a century. What is so special about her is not only how many years she has held the office but how she embodied the details and the ideals of public service. Since she was first elected in 1972, a lot has changed about the way elections are conducted, but through all of those decades, the same fundamental principles have guided Emogene Stegall's work: a dedication to treating all voters fairly without any regard for party affiliation and safeguarding taxpayer dollars--no partisan politics, no attention- grabbing headlines, just humble public service. Before being elected supervisor, Emogene had already worked 14 years as the supervisor's deputy, starting in 1958. At that time there were only about 17,000 registered voters in Lake County and a handful of voting machines. Most of it was done by paper ballot. Her office used typewriters and carbon paper to function, and voting results were announced on the radio. Fast-forward to today. Emogene has been reelected many times over since winning her first election in 1972, and the number of registered voters in the county has gone from 17,000 to over 200,000. Now the supervisor's office is filled with computers, and computer programs tally the votes on election day before publishing them on the Internet so the voters receive almost instant results. Even with all these changes, Emogene is still there, opening her office to constituents of all political stripes and working long hours to make sure election day runs smoothly and that all citizens in Lake County can exercise their constitutional right to vote. Her principled approach to fulfilling her responsibilities explains why she has continued to be reelected to her post time and time again even though she is a registered Democrat in a county that shifted to Republican control long ago. The changes Emogene has witnessed run deeper than the office equipment and the party politics. When she was first elected, Lake County, along with much of the South of the United States, was still suffering from the scourge of Jim Crowe. African Americans in particular were often denied the right to vote. Even after the civil rights legislation was passed in the 1960s, the country still needed public servants to implement the law without prejudice in order to usher in change and combat racism. Emogene's steadfast commitment to ensuring the people's right to vote helped achieve that transformation and in a way brings our Nation closer to realizing the ideal of equality that we have reached and have tried to reach since our founding. It is also notable that Emogene Stegall served as the first woman elected official and community leader at a time when women's educational and professional opportunities were much more limited than today. After so many decades of public service, Emogene will oversee her last election day this November. But her legacy for being a committed and tireless public servant will continue to be remembered. She has used her position to benefit the community she was elected to serve. She never was elected, nor used it, for herself or her own interests. Emogene Stegall is an example for all of us in public service. So I am honored to share her story and acknowledge her accomplishments on this occasion today on the floor of the Senate as Emogene Stegall will conduct and is preparing for her last election as Supervisor of Elections. What a great public service. What a great public servant whom we can honor today. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the weekend, we were reminded once again of the threat that terrorism poses to our communities all across this country. I know we are all grateful the explosions that occurred in New Jersey and Manhattan and the knife attack in Minnesota did not hurt more people. I am thankful for the authorities, the law enforcement officials, the emergency medical officials and others who have responded so heroically. I am grateful there has already been a suspect detained in the New York and New Jersey incident before he could attempt additional attacks. This is just another reminder, as if we needed more reminders, of the importance of remaining vigilant to the threat of terrorism in the United States. Our values and our way of life seem to be under near constant attack, certainly under constant threat. We have a responsibility to do everything we can within our power to support and protect those affected by the evil of terrorism within our borders. Last week, the Senate sent a piece of legislation, an important piece of legislation from my perspective, called the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act to President Obama for his signature. He has until Friday to act on it. I want to clarify for my colleagues exactly what is contained in this legislation because I have heard from some stories that make me think they are being misled by some but also maybe there is just some confusion I can help clear up. This legislation, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or sometimes called the 9/11 families bill, makes some narrow amendments to a longstanding Federal statute, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and the anti-terrorism act. What it does provide is for Americans to be able to seek recourse in a court of law from governments or people who sponsor terrorist attacks on American soil. You would think that would not be particularly controversial. Put another way, this bill does not allow a lawsuit to proceed against a foreign nation unless they are alleged to have been behind a terror attack on American soil. As I said, this is pretty straightforward, which is why it passed the Senate and the House unanimously. I want to be clear what the bill does and does not do. First of all, the legislation does not single out any particular country for some kind of unfair treatment. It stands for the simple proposition that Americans should have recourse against those involved in terrorist attacks on our homeland, just as they do against others who commit other wrongs. I have had some of my colleagues say: Yes, but perception is reality. Well, misperception is not reality. The fact is, there is no country mentioned in the legislation, this extension of existing law. To the extent it singles out anybody, it only singles out countries, without naming any, that fund terrorists who commit terrorism on our soil. Some have suggested this could hurt our relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in particular. This bill has nothing to do, on its face, with our [[Page S5875]] strong partnership with Saudi Arabia, which is based on mutual interests. The reality is, the nuclear deal struck by President Obama involving the country of Iran has done far more to damage our relationship with our allies in the Middle East, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It has caused many of our allies, not just the Saudis but others in the Middle East, to question whether we are a reliable ally in the areas where we do share a common interest. We know many of our Gulf State allies, including the Saudis, believe the President has not done enough to achieve his own stated goal of defeating the terrorist army of ISIS, which threatens Saudi Arabia from Iraq, just across its northern border. Quite to the contrary, we know President Obama ignored the advice of his own military advisers and unwisely withdrew all combat forces from Iraq in a precipitous way before that country was ready and able to defend itself, only to see ISIS rush in and fill the vacuum left after the departure of American leadership and ground forces. The bottom line is that this legislation should not upset our relationships with any country with which we share common interests, including the Saudis. They should not take passage of this legislation as a reason to somehow question our commitment to an alliance based on shared values or shared interests. This bill targets those who fund terrorist activity against us--plain and simple. I should also add that all this bill does is to give victims an opportunity to have their case heard in court. It doesn't decide the merits of the case. It simply gives them an avenue for justice. Second, I want to debunk this idea that somehow the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act will suddenly result in lawsuits being filed against Americans by foreign governments. The reality is this already happens. We have an entire office at the Justice Department--the Office of Foreign Litigation--that defends the United States in foreign courts. As its Web site explains, that litigation includes ``litigation arising from U.S. agency or military activities in foreign countries,'' which is one reason why, before we pulled out all of our troops from Iraq, President Obama and his administration should have done a better job pursuing a status of forces agreement with the country of Iraq. But because they did not negotiate that, they decided to pull out, and we have reaped the whirlwind as a result. While likely a minority, there are cases, in fact, brought abroad that implicate our own overseas activity. For example, in 2010, CBS News reported on a case in Pakistan in which the CIA was sued for an alleged drone strike. This is a matter of public record that CBS News reported. The point is that today foreign governments allow suits against the United States from time to time, and they are defended based on international law and based on the merits of the case. That is because of their legal systems and domestic politics. Our laws are simply not consulted as a determining factor. Why would a foreign country apply American law or precedent or procedure? But let me also make clear: The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act makes only modest changes to current foreign sovereign immunity laws--laws that have already been passed by the U.S. Congress--and it has been written in a narrow manner to prevent such suits should any reciprocal law be passed. Finally, I remind my colleagues that this legislation was crafted and created through consensus. Before the Senate passed it several months ago, my colleagues and I took great care to address concerns from Members on both sides of the aisle, as you would expect. Working with other Members, we made changes to the legislation they requested so we could keep support for this legislation and support for the families of victims strong. It then unanimously passed the Senate in May. Over in the House, it passed without dissent. I have to say that it is hard to find any piece of legislation that can pass unanimously in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. It just doesn't happen very often. But even with so much bipartisan, bicameral support, President Obama still says he intends to veto the legislation. As I have said before, that is his prerogative, but I hope he does so soon so that Congress has the opportunity to vote to override his veto. Once he does veto it, I hope Congress will quickly act. I have been reminded of a passage in Henry Kissinger's book called ``World Order,'' where he talks about how the West, in particular, often views the world as an orderly rules-based system. Of course, the problem with that is reality. The world does not all acknowledge a rules-based system, no matter who imagines it. Other countries will take actions based on what they perceive to advance their own interests, not because they just want to follow a certain set of rules that somebody else wrote up. That will remain true for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia even after the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act becomes law. That is why our relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will continue, because they have been fighting terrorism on their own soil and we know that we share other interests as well. But at the end of the day, we need to do what is right for the American people, just as other countries would do right for their own citizens. We should not change our domestic laws because of our concerns about other countries perhaps being offended or because they have other interests other than what we are trying to vindicate here, which are the rights of the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 due to a terrorist attack on American soil. They should have the opportunity to make their case if they can, and nothing in this judges the merits of the case or makes any conclusion about whether they will be successful or not. But, certainly, they represent part of the American people who we work for, and they are entitled to get access to the courts for the purpose of making the case if they can. This bill sends a clear signal to every country that the United States is not afraid to stand and ensure that our countrymen and countrywomen have the ability to pursue justice here in our courts. That is nonnegotiable. I hope the President will act quickly. The President can string this out into next week if he wants, but he has already said he is going to veto it. So why put the families through any more delay, anguish, and uncertainty? The President should go ahead and veto the legislation. Then the Senate and the House of Representatives should take up a veto override vote. I am confident of what the outcome of that would be, based on the unanimous consent to the bill in the Senate and the unanimous vote in the House of Representatives. Madam President, I don't see any other Senator interested in speaking. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.

On September 18, 1947, President Truman signed the National Security Act, which established the U.S. Air Force as an independent service equal to the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. The mission of the U.S. Air Force is to fly, fight, and win in airspace and cyberspace, and Colorado is proud to call itself home to units that play a vital role in executing all aspects of the Air Force mission. Although it is the youngest of the armed services, the Air Force has accomplished a tremendous amount--a tremendous amount--in those 69 years. With a combined force strength of more than 660,000 Active, Reserve, National Guard, and civilian personnel within the U.S. Air Force, it is a force to be reckoned with. The U.S. Air Force's ability to maintain air superiority is evidenced by the fact that the last time an American ground troop was killed by ordnance delivered from an enemy aircraft was in 1953. On any given day, there are more than 21,000 Air Force personnel deployed to 179 worldwide locations, 16,000 airmen deployed to the CENTCOM area of operations, and more than 1,000 airmen working directly with partner nations. While American airmen serve all over the world, there are thousands of airmen in my State of Colorado protecting our Nation's interests. Colorado is home to five major Air Force installations that include Buckley Air Force Base, Schriever Air Force Base, Peterson Air Force Base, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, and the United States Air Force Academy. Buckley Air Force Base is home to the 460th Space Wing and has air operations, space-based missile warning capabilities, space surveillance operations, space communications operations, and support functions. If North Korea, Iran, or any adversary fires a missile at the U.S. homeland, Buckley would be the first to see it. Buckley is also one of 18 bases nationwide being considered by the Air Force to host the next-generation F-35 jet, and it is my firm belief it fully merits that designation as well. Peterson Air Force Base, named after 1st Lt. Edward J. Peterson, a Colorado native, has been in operation since 1926. Over its 90-plus years, Peterson Air Force Base has served a variety of operational and training missions and is currently home to the 21st Space Wing and Air Force Space Command as well. Peterson is also home to the U.S. Northern Command--NORTHCOM--and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD. NORAD-NORTHCOM is responsible for protecting the U.S. homeland from the myriad of threats we face in today's complex global security environment. On a day like today, when we reflect on what happened in Minnesota, when we reflect on what happened in New Jersey, and when we reflect on what happened in New York, we know that efforts to protect our homeland are critically important. In a recent letter to the President, several colleagues and I expressed grave concerns about the rapid advancement of North Korea's nuclear ballistic missile program. That regime represents a grave threat to global peace and stability and is a direct threat to the U.S. homeland--and that is what our bases in Colorado are responsible for. While we in Congress urge the President to take actions to counter the North Korean threat, the American people rely on the hard-working men and women at NORAD-NORTHCOM to protect us from this rogue regime. Just down the road from Peterson Air Force Base is Schriever Air Force Base, which is home to the 50th Space Wing of the Air Force Space Command. Schriever provides command and control for over 170 Department of Defense warning, navigational, and communications satellites. The global positioning satellite, or GPS, is operated by the 2nd Space Operations Squadron at Schriever. If you successfully use your Google Maps today, it is because of the good work by the satellite operators at Schriever. Schriever is home to the Joint Interagency Space Operations Center, or JICSpOC. Established in 2015, the JICSpOC consolidates efforts between the DOD, U.S. Strategic Command, and the intelligence community to create unity of effort and facilitate U.S. information-sharing across the national security space enterprise. JICSpOC will enhance U.S. space operations, contribute to operational command and control within the Department of Defense, and improve the Nation's ability to protect and defend critical infrastructure in an increasingly contested space environment. Since 1966, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force, stationed in Colorado Springs, has been a synergistic hub for tracking security threats worldwide and serves as an essential component to the defense of North America and global security. Cheyenne Mountain is an engineering marvel that provides an electromagnetic pulse-hardened facility to protect our Nation's most vital interests. Many of the people around the country may know Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station as the site of Matthew Broderick in the movie ``WarGames.'' Last but not least of the major Air Force installations in Colorado is the U.S. Air Force Academy. Since the 1955 swearing-in of its first class of cadets, the Air Force Academy has been developing leaders of character to lead the world's best Air Force. The Air Force Academy educates, trains, and inspires men and women to become officers of character, motivated to lead the U.S. Air Force in service to our Nation. In addition to celebrating the Air Force's 69th birthday, I would also like to recognize that this year, 2016, is the 40th anniversary of women cadets enrolling in the U.S. Air Force Academy. Just as the Air Force leads the way as the preeminent global air power, the Air Force Academy has been leading the way with the integration of women cadets into the Cadet Wing. In 1972, the Air Force Academy issued Operational Plan 36-72, which laid the groundwork for the arrival of its first 156 female cadets in the summer of 1976. In the proceeding 40 years, women cadets and graduates have made extraordinary contributions to both the academy and to the Air Force. These contributions are exemplified by women such as Michelle Johnson, who in 1980 became the first woman cadet wing commander, which is the highest ranking cadet in the academy, and then in 1981 she became the first woman cadet to become a Rhodes scholar. In 2013, Lt. Gen. Michelle Johnson became the first female superintendent of any military service academy when she became the superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy. Heather Wilson was the first female veteran to serve in Congress. Lt. Gen. Susan J. Helms was the first woman graduate of the Air Force Academy to go into space. Lieutenant Roslyn Schulte became the first female graduate killed by enemy action in 2009. These women and countless others are why the State of Colorado is proud, honored, and humbled to host the U.S. Air Force Academy. On behalf of all Coloradoans and a grateful nation, I wish the U.S. Air Force a happy 69th birthday. Aim high, fly, fight, and win. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

The legislative clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 516, H.R. 5325, a bill making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Zika Virus Funding Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we have a bit of good news because earlier today the CDC, or the Centers for Disease Control, announced that it had lifted its travel advisory to not go into a section north of downtown Miami called Wynwood. It is the neighborhood where the first locally transmitted Zika virus was found. So the fact that they said today that this area is no longer considered an area of active transmission is certainly good news, not only for those who live there but for those businesses that are dependent on those who are planning to visit there. That is just one area of Florida. There are now 835 active cases of Zika-infected people in the State of Florida. If you compare that to the number for the total United States, talking about infections, in 49 of the 50 States, it is 3,132. If you add our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico and the territories, fellow American citizens, 17,315 are infected with the Zika virus. In Florida, 86 pregnant women are infected with the Zika virus. The total in the Nation is 731. In Puerto Rico--primarily there, although bringing in all the territories, it is 1,156. Combining Puerto Rico, the territories, and the United States, we are talking about close to 2,000 pregnant women infected with the Zika virus. We know that the CDC has said that there is anywhere from a 1-percent to 12-percent chance--if a woman is infected in the first trimester of pregnancy, there is a 1- to 12-percent chance that her baby will be born with defects. If you do the math on the nearly 2,000 pregnant women, we are talking about a substantial number of birth defects, including the possibility of what we have heard about and seen-- microcephaly, babies with a deformed brain and shrunken head. In Puerto Rico they already had one live birth of microcephaly and they had one who did not live after birth. We can expect to see huge numbers coming on down the line. That is all the more reason for us--since we started our request for funding last spring--to get at this by doing a Zika vaccine. It is now ready to go into the FDA first trials. A vaccine is at least 2 years away, but we have to get started, and that costs money. The administration has been robbing Peter to pay Paul, finding every little pot of money that it can borrow from since last spring in order to try to fund the preventive measures of a vaccine, mosquito control, and all the attendant health expenditures through our health care centers that are sponsored and paid for by the government, and particularly for the very poor. As a matter of fact, the government raided the Ebola fund of $576 million to advance it to Zika. Well, we need to pay back all of those funds that were raided, and that is incumbent upon us now here at the last minute before we adjourn to go home to campaign before the election. You know, those words are suddenly similar to the words we used in early July, trying to get that done before the summer recess for the political conventions. Yet we did not. The good news is that it looks as though there is now an agreement on Zika. As a result, we can come up with a funding bill to keep the government open until we can pass a permanent funding bill for this fiscal year starting October 1. We will pass a temporary one until sometime in early December. That will give us a chance to try to do the permanent one. In the meantime, the government has to stay open. We have to fund the functions of government, including national security and the U.S. Department of Defense. So one would think that this bill would be all done, but, unrelated to Zika, there are other issues that are threatening the funding bill. At the end of the day, we will get it done. Some of the issues are over as arcane a subject as who is going to administer the issuance of domain names on the Internet. There seems to be some controversy over that. As a result, we are here at the last minute, at the last [[Page S5874]] hour, having to act on a funding bill, and now we have issues that are now all wound around the axle again. I want to say very positively that I appreciate the progress that is being made on the Zika funding. It is not as if we haven't tried this before. Last May we had a bill that passed in a bipartisan fashion for $1.1 billion that did not have the attached political riders. It passed in the Senate by 89 votes out of 100 Senators. Then, of course, the bill in the House of Representatives got all wound up with all kinds of political messaging. I want to state very positively that I am very happy that it seems as if those issues have been put aside and there has been an agreement reached. Now let's get through the rest of this on the funding bill and go ahead and execute our responsibilities that we have to the United States of America. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Tribute to Emogene Stegall Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to praise the work of a local elected official in Florida who has admirably served as supervisor of elections in Lake County, FL. This is an elected position in which she has now served for 44 years, and she is going to retire from her position as the chief elections officer after this upcoming election in November. That is an incredible tenure of public service, and Emogene Stegall should be commended for being the longtime supervisor of elections. ``Emogene'' is a name that is almost synonymous with ``Lake County'' because she has been an elected official for nearly half a century. What is so special about her is not only how many years she has held the office but how she embodied the details and the ideals of public service. Since she was first elected in 1972, a lot has changed about the way elections are conducted, but through all of those decades, the same fundamental principles have guided Emogene Stegall's work: a dedication to treating all voters fairly without any regard for party affiliation and safeguarding taxpayer dollars--no partisan politics, no attention- grabbing headlines, just humble public service. Before being elected supervisor, Emogene had already worked 14 years as the supervisor's deputy, starting in 1958. At that time there were only about 17,000 registered voters in Lake County and a handful of voting machines. Most of it was done by paper ballot. Her office used typewriters and carbon paper to function, and voting results were announced on the radio. Fast-forward to today. Emogene has been reelected many times over since winning her first election in 1972, and the number of registered voters in the county has gone from 17,000 to over 200,000. Now the supervisor's office is filled with computers, and computer programs tally the votes on election day before publishing them on the Internet so the voters receive almost instant results. Even with all these changes, Emogene is still there, opening her office to constituents of all political stripes and working long hours to make sure election day runs smoothly and that all citizens in Lake County can exercise their constitutional right to vote. Her principled approach to fulfilling her responsibilities explains why she has continued to be reelected to her post time and time again even though she is a registered Democrat in a county that shifted to Republican control long ago. The changes Emogene has witnessed run deeper than the office equipment and the party politics. When she was first elected, Lake County, along with much of the South of the United States, was still suffering from the scourge of Jim Crowe. African Americans in particular were often denied the right to vote. Even after the civil rights legislation was passed in the 1960s, the country still needed public servants to implement the law without prejudice in order to usher in change and combat racism. Emogene's steadfast commitment to ensuring the people's right to vote helped achieve that transformation and in a way brings our Nation closer to realizing the ideal of equality that we have reached and have tried to reach since our founding. It is also notable that Emogene Stegall served as the first woman elected official and community leader at a time when women's educational and professional opportunities were much more limited than today. After so many decades of public service, Emogene will oversee her last election day this November. But her legacy for being a committed and tireless public servant will continue to be remembered. She has used her position to benefit the community she was elected to serve. She never was elected, nor used it, for herself or her own interests. Emogene Stegall is an example for all of us in public service. So I am honored to share her story and acknowledge her accomplishments on this occasion today on the floor of the Senate as Emogene Stegall will conduct and is preparing for her last election as Supervisor of Elections. What a great public service. What a great public servant whom we can honor today. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the weekend, we were reminded once again of the threat that terrorism poses to our communities all across this country. I know we are all grateful the explosions that occurred in New Jersey and Manhattan and the knife attack in Minnesota did not hurt more people. I am thankful for the authorities, the law enforcement officials, the emergency medical officials and others who have responded so heroically. I am grateful there has already been a suspect detained in the New York and New Jersey incident before he could attempt additional attacks. This is just another reminder, as if we needed more reminders, of the importance of remaining vigilant to the threat of terrorism in the United States. Our values and our way of life seem to be under near constant attack, certainly under constant threat. We have a responsibility to do everything we can within our power to support and protect those affected by the evil of terrorism within our borders. Last week, the Senate sent a piece of legislation, an important piece of legislation from my perspective, called the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act to President Obama for his signature. He has until Friday to act on it. I want to clarify for my colleagues exactly what is contained in this legislation because I have heard from some stories that make me think they are being misled by some but also maybe there is just some confusion I can help clear up. This legislation, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or sometimes called the 9/11 families bill, makes some narrow amendments to a longstanding Federal statute, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and the anti-terrorism act. What it does provide is for Americans to be able to seek recourse in a court of law from governments or people who sponsor terrorist attacks on American soil. You would think that would not be particularly controversial. Put another way, this bill does not allow a lawsuit to proceed against a foreign nation unless they are alleged to have been behind a terror attack on American soil. As I said, this is pretty straightforward, which is why it passed the Senate and the House unanimously. I want to be clear what the bill does and does not do. First of all, the legislation does not single out any particular country for some kind of unfair treatment. It stands for the simple proposition that Americans should have recourse against those involved in terrorist attacks on our homeland, just as they do against others who commit other wrongs. I have had some of my colleagues say: Yes, but perception is reality. Well, misperception is not reality. The fact is, there is no country mentioned in the legislation, this extension of existing law. To the extent it singles out anybody, it only singles out countries, without naming any, that fund terrorists who commit terrorism on our soil. Some have suggested this could hurt our relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in particular. This bill has nothing to do, on its face, with our [[Page S5875]] strong partnership with Saudi Arabia, which is based on mutual interests. The reality is, the nuclear deal struck by President Obama involving the country of Iran has done far more to damage our relationship with our allies in the Middle East, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It has caused many of our allies, not just the Saudis but others in the Middle East, to question whether we are a reliable ally in the areas where we do share a common interest. We know many of our Gulf State allies, including the Saudis, believe the President has not done enough to achieve his own stated goal of defeating the terrorist army of ISIS, which threatens Saudi Arabia from Iraq, just across its northern border. Quite to the contrary, we know President Obama ignored the advice of his own military advisers and unwisely withdrew all combat forces from Iraq in a precipitous way before that country was ready and able to defend itself, only to see ISIS rush in and fill the vacuum left after the departure of American leadership and ground forces. The bottom line is that this legislation should not upset our relationships with any country with which we share common interests, including the Saudis. They should not take passage of this legislation as a reason to somehow question our commitment to an alliance based on shared values or shared interests. This bill targets those who fund terrorist activity against us--plain and simple. I should also add that all this bill does is to give victims an opportunity to have their case heard in court. It doesn't decide the merits of the case. It simply gives them an avenue for justice. Second, I want to debunk this idea that somehow the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act will suddenly result in lawsuits being filed against Americans by foreign governments. The reality is this already happens. We have an entire office at the Justice Department--the Office of Foreign Litigation--that defends the United States in foreign courts. As its Web site explains, that litigation includes ``litigation arising from U.S. agency or military activities in foreign countries,'' which is one reason why, before we pulled out all of our troops from Iraq, President Obama and his administration should have done a better job pursuing a status of forces agreement with the country of Iraq. But because they did not negotiate that, they decided to pull out, and we have reaped the whirlwind as a result. While likely a minority, there are cases, in fact, brought abroad that implicate our own overseas activity. For example, in 2010, CBS News reported on a case in Pakistan in which the CIA was sued for an alleged drone strike. This is a matter of public record that CBS News reported. The point is that today foreign governments allow suits against the United States from time to time, and they are defended based on international law and based on the merits of the case. That is because of their legal systems and domestic politics. Our laws are simply not consulted as a determining factor. Why would a foreign country apply American law or precedent or procedure? But let me also make clear: The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act makes only modest changes to current foreign sovereign immunity laws--laws that have already been passed by the U.S. Congress--and it has been written in a narrow manner to prevent such suits should any reciprocal law be passed. Finally, I remind my colleagues that this legislation was crafted and created through consensus. Before the Senate passed it several months ago, my colleagues and I took great care to address concerns from Members on both sides of the aisle, as you would expect. Working with other Members, we made changes to the legislation they requested so we could keep support for this legislation and support for the families of victims strong. It then unanimously passed the Senate in May. Over in the House, it passed without dissent. I have to say that it is hard to find any piece of legislation that can pass unanimously in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. It just doesn't happen very often. But even with so much bipartisan, bicameral support, President Obama still says he intends to veto the legislation. As I have said before, that is his prerogative, but I hope he does so soon so that Congress has the opportunity to vote to override his veto. Once he does veto it, I hope Congress will quickly act. I have been reminded of a passage in Henry Kissinger's book called ``World Order,'' where he talks about how the West, in particular, often views the world as an orderly rules-based system. Of course, the problem with that is reality. The world does not all acknowledge a rules-based system, no matter who imagines it. Other countries will take actions based on what they perceive to advance their own interests, not because they just want to follow a certain set of rules that somebody else wrote up. That will remain true for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia even after the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act becomes law. That is why our relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will continue, because they have been fighting terrorism on their own soil and we know that we share other interests as well. But at the end of the day, we need to do what is right for the American people, just as other countries would do right for their own citizens. We should not change our domestic laws because of our concerns about other countries perhaps being offended or because they have other interests other than what we are trying to vindicate here, which are the rights of the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 due to a terrorist attack on American soil. They should have the opportunity to make their case if they can, and nothing in this judges the merits of the case or makes any conclusion about whether they will be successful or not. But, certainly, they represent part of the American people who we work for, and they are entitled to get access to the courts for the purpose of making the case if they can. This bill sends a clear signal to every country that the United States is not afraid to stand and ensure that our countrymen and countrywomen have the ability to pursue justice here in our courts. That is nonnegotiable. I hope the President will act quickly. The President can string this out into next week if he wants, but he has already said he is going to veto it. So why put the families through any more delay, anguish, and uncertainty? The President should go ahead and veto the legislation. Then the Senate and the House of Representatives should take up a veto override vote. I am confident of what the outcome of that would be, based on the unanimous consent to the bill in the Senate and the unanimous vote in the House of Representatives. Madam President, I don't see any other Senator interested in speaking. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to H.R. 5325 ripen at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, September 20. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [[Page S5876]] Recognizing the United States Air Force Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I rise to recognize the U.S. Air Force on the occasion of its 69th birthday. On September 18, 1947, President Truman signed the National Security Act, which established the U.S. Air Force as an independent service equal to the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. The mission of the U.S. Air Force is to fly, fight, and win in airspace and cyberspace, and Colorado is proud to call itself home to units that play a vital role in executing all aspects of the Air Force mission. Although it is the youngest of the armed services, the Air Force has accomplished a tremendous amount--a tremendous amount--in those 69 years. With a combined force strength of more than 660,000 Active, Reserve, National Guard, and civilian personnel within the U.S. Air Force, it is a force to be reckoned with. The U.S. Air Force's ability to maintain air superiority is evidenced by the fact that the last time an American ground troop was killed by ordnance delivered from an enemy aircraft was in 1953. On any given day, there are more than 21,000 Air Force personnel deployed to 179 worldwide locations, 16,000 airmen deployed to the CENTCOM area of operations, and more than 1,000 airmen working directly with partner nations. While American airmen serve all over the world, there are thousands of airmen in my State of Colorado protecting our Nation's interests. Colorado is home to five major Air Force installations that include Buckley Air Force Base, Schriever Air Force Base, Peterson Air Force Base, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, and the United States Air Force Academy. Buckley Air Force Base is home to the 460th Space Wing and has air operations, space-based missile warning capabilities, space surveillance operations, space communications operations, and support functions. If North Korea, Iran, or any adversary fires a missile at the U.S. homeland, Buckley would be the first to see it. Buckley is also one of 18 bases nationwide being considered by the Air Force to host the next-generation F-35 jet, and it is my firm belief it fully merits that designation as well. Peterson Air Force Base, named after 1st Lt. Edward J. Peterson, a Colorado native, has been in operation since 1926. Over its 90-plus years, Peterson Air Force Base has served a variety of operational and training missions and is currently home to the 21st Space Wing and Air Force Space Command as well. Peterson is also home to the U.S. Northern Command--NORTHCOM--and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD. NORAD-NORTHCOM is responsible for protecting the U.S. homeland from the myriad of threats we face in today's complex global security environment. On a day like today, when we reflect on what happened in Minnesota, when we reflect on what happened in New Jersey, and when we reflect on what happened in New York, we know that efforts to protect our homeland are critically important. In a recent letter to the President, several colleagues and I expressed grave concerns about the rapid advancement of North Korea's nuclear ballistic missile program. That regime represents a grave threat to global peace and stability and is a direct threat to the U.S. homeland--and that is what our bases in Colorado are responsible for. While we in Congress urge the President to take actions to counter the North Korean threat, the American people rely on the hard-working men and women at NORAD-NORTHCOM to protect us from this rogue regime. Just down the road from Peterson Air Force Base is Schriever Air Force Base, which is home to the 50th Space Wing of the Air Force Space Command. Schriever provides command and control for over 170 Department of Defense warning, navigational, and communications satellites. The global positioning satellite, or GPS, is operated by the 2nd Space Operations Squadron at Schriever. If you successfully use your Google Maps today, it is because of the good work by the satellite operators at Schriever. Schriever is home to the Joint Interagency Space Operations Center, or JICSpOC. Established in 2015, the JICSpOC consolidates efforts between the DOD, U.S. Strategic Command, and the intelligence community to create unity of effort and facilitate U.S. information-sharing across the national security space enterprise. JICSpOC will enhance U.S. space operations, contribute to operational command and control within the Department of Defense, and improve the Nation's ability to protect and defend critical infrastructure in an increasingly contested space environment. Since 1966, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force, stationed in Colorado Springs, has been a synergistic hub for tracking security threats worldwide and serves as an essential component to the defense of North America and global security. Cheyenne Mountain is an engineering marvel that provides an electromagnetic pulse-hardened facility to protect our Nation's most vital interests. Many of the people around the country may know Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station as the site of Matthew Broderick in the movie ``WarGames.'' Last but not least of the major Air Force installations in Colorado is the U.S. Air Force Academy. Since the 1955 swearing-in of its first class of cadets, the Air Force Academy has been developing leaders of character to lead the world's best Air Force. The Air Force Academy educates, trains, and inspires men and women to become officers of character, motivated to lead the U.S. Air Force in service to our Nation. In addition to celebrating the Air Force's 69th birthday, I would also like to recognize that this year, 2016, is the 40th anniversary of women cadets enrolling in the U.S. Air Force Academy. Just as the Air Force leads the way as the preeminent global air power, the Air Force Academy has been leading the way with the integration of women cadets into the Cadet Wing. In 1972, the Air Force Academy issued Operational Plan 36-72, which laid the groundwork for the arrival of its first 156 female cadets in the summer of 1976. In the proceeding 40 years, women cadets and graduates have made extraordinary contributions to both the academy and to the Air Force. These contributions are exemplified by women such as Michelle Johnson, who in 1980 became the first woman cadet wing commander, which is the highest ranking cadet in the academy, and then in 1981 she became the first woman cadet to become a Rhodes scholar. In 2013, Lt. Gen. Michelle Johnson became the first female superintendent of any military service academy when she became the superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy. Heather Wilson was the first female veteran to serve in Congress. Lt. Gen. Susan J. Helms was the first woman graduate of the Air Force Academy to go into space. Lieutenant Roslyn Schulte became the first female graduate killed by enemy action in 2009. These women and countless others are why the State of Colorado is proud, honored, and humbled to host the U.S. Air Force Academy. On behalf of all Coloradoans and a grateful nation, I wish the U.S. Air Force a happy 69th birthday. Aim high, fly, fight, and win. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

infected with the zika virus. in florida, 86 pregnant women are infected with the zika virus. the total in the nation is 731. in puerto rico--primarily there, although bringing in all the territories, it is 1,156. combining puerto rico, the territories, and the united states, we are talking about close to 2,000 pregnant women infected with the zika virus. we know that the cdc has said that there is anywhere from a 1-percent to 12-percent chance--if a woman is infected in the first trimester of pregnancy, there is a 1- to 12-percent chance that her baby will be born with defects. if you do the math on the nearly 2,000 pregnant women, we are talking about a substantial number of birth defects, including the possibility of what we have heard about and seen-- microcephaly, babies with a deformed brain and shrunken head. in puerto rico they already had one live birth of microcephaly and they had one who did not live after birth. we can expect to see huge numbers coming on down the line. that is all the more reason for us--since we started our request for funding last spring--to get at this by doing a zika vaccine. it is now ready to go into the fda first trials. a vaccine is at least 2 years away, but we have to get started, and that costs money. the administration has been robbing peter to pay paul, finding every little pot of money that it can borrow from since last spring in order to try to fund the preventive measures of a vaccine, mosquito control, and all the attendant health expenditures through our health care centers that are sponsored and paid for by the government, and particularly for the very poor. as a matter of fact, the government raided the ebola fund of $576 million to advance it to zika. well, we need to pay back all of those funds that were raided, and that is incumbent upon us now here at the last minute before we adjourn to go home to campaign before the election. you know, those words are suddenly similar to the words we used in early july, trying to get that done before the summer recess for the political conventions. yet we did not. the good news is that it looks as though there is now an agreement on zika. as a result, we can come up with a funding bill to keep the government open until we can pass a permanent funding bill for this fiscal year starting october 1. we will pass a temporary one until sometime in early december. that will give us a chance to try to do the permanent one. in the meantime, the government has to stay open. we have to fund the functions of government, including national security and the u.s. department of defense. so one would think that this bill would be all done, but, unrelated to zika, there are other issues that are threatening the funding bill. at the end of the day, we will get it done. some of the issues are over as arcane a subject as who is going to administer the issuance of domain names on the internet. there seems to be some controversy over that. as a result, we are here at the last minute, at the last [[page s5874]] hour, having to act on a funding bill, and now we have issues that are now all wound around the axle again. i want to say very positively that i appreciate the progress that is being made on the zika funding. it is not as if we haven't tried this before. last may we had a bill that passed in a bipartisan fashion for $1.1 billion that did not have the attached political riders. it passed in the senate by 89 votes out of 100 senators. then, of course, the bill in the house of representatives got all wound up with all kinds of political messaging. i want to state very positively that i am very happy that it seems as if those issues have been put aside and there has been an agreement reached. now let's get through the rest of this on the funding bill and go ahead and execute our responsibilities that we have to the united states of america. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from florida. tribute to emogene stegall mr. nelson. mr. president, i want to praise the work of a local elected official in florida who has admirably served as supervisor of elections in lake county, fl. this is an elected position in which she has now served for 44 years, and she is going to retire from her position as the chief elections officer after this upcoming election in november. that is an incredible tenure of public service, and emogene stegall should be commended for being the longtime supervisor of elections. ``emogene'' is a name that is almost synonymous with ``lake county'' because she has been an elected official for nearly half a century. what is so special about her is not only how many years she has held the office but how she embodied the details and the ideals of public service. since she was first elected in 1972, a lot has changed about the way elections are conducted, but through all of those decades, the same fundamental principles have guided emogene stegall's work: a dedication to treating all voters fairly without any regard for party affiliation and safeguarding taxpayer dollars--no partisan politics, no attention- grabbing headlines, just humble public service. before being elected supervisor, emogene had already worked 14 years as the supervisor's deputy, starting in 1958. at that time there were only about 17,000 registered voters in lake county and a handful of voting machines. most of it was done by paper ballot. her office used typewriters and carbon paper to function, and voting results were announced on the radio. fast-forward to today. emogene has been reelected many times over since winning her first election in 1972, and the number of registered voters in the county has gone from 17,000 to over 200,000. now the supervisor's office is filled with computers, and computer programs tally the votes on election day before publishing them on the internet so the voters receive almost instant results. even with all these changes, emogene is still there, opening her office to constituents of all political stripes and working long hours to make sure election day runs smoothly and that all citizens in lake county can exercise their constitutional right to vote. her principled approach to fulfilling her responsibilities explains why she has continued to be reelected to her post time and time again even though she is a registered democrat in a county that shifted to republican control long ago. the changes emogene has witnessed run deeper than the office equipment and the party politics. when she was first elected, lake county, along with much of the south of the united states, was still suffering from the scourge of jim crowe. african americans in particular were often denied the right to vote. even after the civil rights legislation was passed in the 1960s, the country still needed public servants to implement the law without prejudice in order to usher in change and combat racism. emogene's steadfast commitment to ensuring the people's right to vote helped achieve that transformation and in a way brings our nation closer to realizing the ideal of equality that we have reached and have tried to reach since our founding. it is also notable that emogene stegall served as the first woman elected official and community leader at a time when women's educational and professional opportunities were much more limited than today. after so many decades of public service, emogene will oversee her last election day this november. but her legacy for being a committed and tireless public servant will continue to be remembered. she has used her position to benefit the community she was elected to serve. she never was elected, nor used it, for herself or her own interests. emogene stegall is an example for all of us in public service. so i am honored to share her story and acknowledge her accomplishments on this occasion today on the floor of the senate as emogene stegall will conduct and is preparing for her last election as supervisor of elections. what a great public service. what a great public servant whom we can honor today. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. justice against sponsors of terrorism act mr. cornyn. mr. president, over the weekend, we were reminded once again of the threat that terrorism poses to our communities all across this country. i know we are all grateful the explosions that occurred in new jersey and manhattan and the knife attack in minnesota did not hurt more people. i am thankful for the authorities, the law enforcement officials, the emergency medical officials and others who have responded so heroically. i am grateful there has already been a suspect detained in the new york and new jersey incident before he could attempt additional attacks. this is just another reminder, as if we needed more reminders, of the importance of remaining vigilant to the threat of terrorism in the united states. our values and our way of life seem to be under near constant attack, certainly under constant threat. we have a responsibility to do everything we can within our power to support and protect those affected by the evil of terrorism within our borders. last week, the senate sent a piece of legislation, an important piece of legislation from my perspective, called the justice against sponsors of terrorism act to president obama for his signature. he has until friday to act on it. i want to clarify for my colleagues exactly what is contained in this legislation because i have heard from some stories that make me think they are being misled by some but also maybe there is just some confusion i can help clear up. this legislation, the justice against sponsors of terrorism act, or sometimes called the 9/11 families bill, makes some narrow amendments to a longstanding federal statute, the foreign sovereign immunities act, and the anti-terrorism act. what it does provide is for americans to be able to seek recourse in a court of law from governments or people who sponsor terrorist attacks on american soil. you would think that would not be particularly controversial. put another way, this bill does not allow a lawsuit to proceed against a foreign nation unless they are alleged to have been behind a terror attack on american soil. as i said, this is pretty straightforward, which is why it passed the senate and the house unanimously. i want to be clear what the bill does and does not do. first of all, the legislation does not single out any particular country for some kind of unfair treatment. it stands for the simple proposition that americans should have recourse against those involved in terrorist attacks on our homeland, just as they do against others who commit other wrongs. i have had some of my colleagues say: yes, but perception is reality. well, misperception is not reality. the fact is, there is no country mentioned in the legislation, this extension of existing law. to the extent it singles out anybody, it only singles out countries, without naming any, that fund terrorists who commit terrorism on our soil. some have suggested this could hurt our relationship with the kingdom of saudi arabia, in particular. this bill has nothing to do, on its face, with our [[page s5875]] strong partnership with saudi arabia, which is based on mutual interests. the reality is, the nuclear deal struck by president obama involving the country of iran has done far more to damage our relationship with our allies in the middle east, including the kingdom of saudi arabia. it has caused many of our allies, not just the saudis but others in the middle east, to question whether we are a reliable ally in the areas where we do share a common interest. we know many of our gulf state allies, including the saudis, believe the president has not done enough to achieve his own stated goal of defeating the terrorist army of isis, which threatens saudi arabia from iraq, just across its northern border. quite to the contrary, we know president obama ignored the advice of his own military advisers and unwisely withdrew all combat forces from iraq in a precipitous way before that country was ready and able to defend itself, only to see isis rush in and fill the vacuum left after the departure of american leadership and ground forces. the bottom line is that this legislation should not upset our relationships with any country with which we share common interests, including the saudis. they should not take passage of this legislation as a reason to somehow question our commitment to an alliance based on shared values or shared interests. this bill targets those who fund terrorist activity against us--plain and simple. i should also add that all this bill does is to give victims an opportunity to have their case heard in court. it doesn't decide the merits of the case. it simply gives them an avenue for justice. second, i want to debunk this idea that somehow the justice against sponsors of terrorism act will suddenly result in lawsuits being filed against americans by foreign governments. the reality is this already happens. we have an entire office at the justice department--the office of foreign litigation--that defends the united states in foreign courts. as its web site explains, that litigation includes ``litigation arising from u.s. agency or military activities in foreign countries,'' which is one reason why, before we pulled out all of our troops from iraq, president obama and his administration should have done a better job pursuing a status of forces agreement with the country of iraq. but because they did not negotiate that, they decided to pull out, and we have reaped the whirlwind as a result. while likely a minority, there are cases, in fact, brought abroad that implicate our own overseas activity. for example, in 2010, cbs news reported on a case in pakistan in which the cia was sued for an alleged drone strike. this is a matter of public record that cbs news reported. the point is that today foreign governments allow suits against the united states from time to time, and they are defended based on international law and based on the merits of the case. that is because of their legal systems and domestic politics. our laws are simply not consulted as a determining factor. why would a foreign country apply american law or precedent or procedure? but let me also make clear: the justice against sponsors of terrorism act makes only modest changes to current foreign sovereign immunity laws--laws that have already been passed by the u.s. congress--and it has been written in a narrow manner to prevent such suits should any reciprocal law be passed. finally, i remind my colleagues that this legislation was crafted and created through consensus. before the senate passed it several months ago, my colleagues and i took great care to address concerns from members on both sides of the aisle, as you would expect. working with other members, we made changes to the legislation they requested so we could keep support for this legislation and support for the families of victims strong. it then unanimously passed the senate in may. over in the house, it passed without dissent. i have to say that it is hard to find any piece of legislation that can pass unanimously in the senate and in the house of representatives. it just doesn't happen very often. but even with so much bipartisan, bicameral support, president obama still says he intends to veto the legislation. as i have said before, that is his prerogative, but i hope he does so soon so that congress has the opportunity to vote to override his veto. once he does veto it, i hope congress will quickly act. i have been reminded of a passage in henry kissinger's book called ``world order,'' where he talks about how the west, in particular, often views the world as an orderly rules-based system. of course, the problem with that is reality. the world does not all acknowledge a rules-based system, no matter who imagines it. other countries will take actions based on what they perceive to advance their own interests, not because they just want to follow a certain set of rules that somebody else wrote up. that will remain true for the kingdom of saudi arabia even after the justice against sponsors of terrorism act becomes law. that is why our relationship with the kingdom of saudi arabia will continue, because they have been fighting terrorism on their own soil and we know that we share other interests as well. but at the end of the day, we need to do what is right for the american people, just as other countries would do right for their own citizens. we should not change our domestic laws because of our concerns about other countries perhaps being offended or because they have other interests other than what we are trying to vindicate here, which are the rights of the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 due to a terrorist attack on american soil. they should have the opportunity to make their case if they can, and nothing in this judges the merits of the case or makes any conclusion about whether they will be successful or not. but, certainly, they represent part of the american people who we work for, and they are entitled to get access to the courts for the purpose of making the case if they can. this bill sends a clear signal to every country that the united states is not afraid to stand and ensure that our countrymen and countrywomen have the ability to pursue justice here in our courts. that is nonnegotiable. i hope the president will act quickly. the president can string this out into next week if he wants, but he has already said he is going to veto it. so why put the families through any more delay, anguish, and uncertainty? the president should go ahead and veto the legislation. then the senate and the house of representatives should take up a veto override vote. i am confident of what the outcome of that would be, based on the unanimous consent to the bill in the senate and the unanimous vote in the house of representatives. madam president, i don't see any other senator interested in speaking. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mrs. ernst). the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. unanimous consent agreement--h.r. 5985 mr. mcconnell. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. today, the senate proceed to the immediate consideration of h.r. 5985; further, that there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form; that following the use or yielding back of time, the bill be read a third time and the senate vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or debate. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. mr. mcconnell. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule xxii, the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to h.r. 5325 ripen at 2:15 p.m. on tuesday, september 20. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. mr. mcconnell. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. gardner. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. [[page s5876]] recognizing the united states air force mr. gardner. madam president, i rise to recognize the u.s. air force on the occasion of its 69th birthday. on september 18, 1947, president truman signed the national security act, which established the u.s. air force as an independent service equal to the u.s. army and u.s. navy. the mission of the u.s. air force is to fly, fight, and win in airspace and cyberspace, and colorado is proud to call itself home to units that play a vital role in executing all aspects of the air force mission. although it is the youngest of the armed services, the air force has accomplished a tremendous amount--a tremendous amount--in those 69 years. with a combined force strength of more than 660,000 active, reserve, national guard, and civilian personnel within the u.s. air force, it is a force to be reckoned with. the u.s. air force's ability to maintain air superiority is evidenced by the fact that the last time an american ground troop was killed by ordnance delivered from an enemy aircraft was in 1953. on any given day, there are more than 21,000 air force personnel deployed to 179 worldwide locations, 16,000 airmen deployed to the centcom area of operations, and more than 1,000 airmen working directly with partner nations. while american airmen serve all over the world, there are thousands of airmen in my state of colorado protecting our nation's interests. colorado is home to five major air force installations that include buckley air force base, schriever air force base, peterson air force base, cheyenne mountain air force station, and the united states air force academy. buckley air force base is home to the 460th space wing and has air operations, space-based missile warning capabilities, space surveillance operations, space communications operations, and support functions. if north korea, iran, or any adversary fires a missile at the u.s. homeland, buckley would be the first to see it. buckley is also one of 18 bases nationwide being considered by the air force to host the next-generation f-35 jet, and it is my firm belief it fully merits that designation as well. peterson air force base, named after 1st lt. edward j. peterson, a colorado native, has been in operation since 1926. over its 90-plus years, peterson air force base has served a variety of operational and training missions and is currently home to the 21st space wing and air force space command as well. peterson is also home to the u.s. northern command--northcom--and the north american aerospace defense command, or norad. norad-northcom is responsible for protecting the u.s. homeland from the myriad of threats we face in today's complex global security environment. on a day like today, when we reflect on what happened in minnesota, when we reflect on what happened in new jersey, and when we reflect on what happened in new york, we know that efforts to protect our homeland are critically important. in a recent letter to the president, several colleagues and i expressed grave concerns about the rapid advancement of north korea's nuclear ballistic missile program. that regime represents a grave threat to global peace and stability and is a direct threat to the u.s. homeland--and that is what our bases in colorado are responsible for. while we in congress urge the president to take actions to counter the north korean threat, the american people rely on the hard-working men and women at norad-northcom to protect us from this rogue regime. just down the road from peterson air force base is schriever air force base, which is home to the 50th space wing of the air force space command. schriever provides command and control for over 170 department of defense warning, navigational, and communications satellites. the global positioning satellite, or gps, is operated by the 2nd space operations squadron at schriever. if you successfully use your google maps today, it is because of the good work by the satellite operators at schriever. schriever is home to the joint interagency space operations center, or jicspoc. established in 2015, the jicspoc consolidates efforts between the dod, u.s. strategic command, and the intelligence community to create unity of effort and facilitate u.s. information-sharing across the national security space enterprise. jicspoc will enhance u.s. space operations, contribute to operational command and control within the department of defense, and improve the nation's ability to protect and defend critical infrastructure in an increasingly contested space environment. since 1966, cheyenne mountain air force, stationed in colorado springs, has been a synergistic hub for tracking security threats worldwide and serves as an essential component to the defense of north america and global security. cheyenne mountain is an engineering marvel that provides an electromagnetic pulse-hardened facility to protect our nation's most vital interests. many of the people around the country may know cheyenne mountain air force station as the site of matthew broderick in the movie ``wargames.'' last but not least of the major air force installations in colorado is the u.s. air force academy. since the 1955 swearing-in of its first class of cadets, the air force academy has been developing leaders of character to lead the world's best air force. the air force academy educates, trains, and inspires men and women to become officers of character, motivated to lead the u.s. air force in service to our nation. in addition to celebrating the air force's 69th birthday, i would also like to recognize that this year, 2016, is the 40th anniversary of women cadets enrolling in the u.s. air force academy. just as the air force leads the way as the preeminent global air power, the air force academy has been leading the way with the integration of women cadets into the cadet wing. in 1972, the air force academy issued operational plan 36-72, which laid the groundwork for the arrival of its first 156 female cadets in the summer of 1976. in the proceeding 40 years, women cadets and graduates have made extraordinary contributions to both the academy and to the air force. these contributions are exemplified by women such as michelle johnson, who in 1980 became the first woman cadet wing commander, which is the highest ranking cadet in the academy, and then in 1981 she became the first woman cadet to become a rhodes scholar. in 2013, lt. gen. michelle johnson became the first female superintendent of any military service academy when she became the superintendent of the u.s. air force academy. heather wilson was the first female veteran to serve in congress. lt. gen. susan j. helms was the first woman graduate of the air force academy to go into space. lieutenant roslyn schulte became the first female graduate killed by enemy action in 2009. these women and countless others are why the state of colorado is proud, honored, and humbled to host the u.s. air force academy. on behalf of all coloradoans and a grateful nation, i wish the u.s. air force a happy 69th birthday. aim high, fly, fight, and win. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. blumenthal. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. coats). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. blumenthal. thank you, mr. president. the presiding officer. will the senator withhold. ____________________",29209

Mr. President, many Americans are taking the news about this weekend's terror attacks in New Jersey, New York, and even Minnesota very seriously. As a country, we are always stunned when these violent acts occur, and we are absolutely sickened by the acts of violence of this terrorist activity. We grieve with the victims, their families, and their loved ones. I had a long, thorough briefing today by the FBI. I appreciate their good work always. They have a difficult job doing everything they can to make sure we are safe. I am aware of the many people injured in these cowardly attacks, including police officers. I wish them all a full and complete recovery. Despite the many injured, we are very grateful that no one was killed in these attacks. It is a credit to both law enforcement and America's terrific, good, brave first responders. Earlier today, the suspect wanted in connection with these cowardly attacks was shot and apprehended by police officers, but, of course, not before he wounded two of these police officers. These officers' quick response most likely kept Americans safe. These events remind us of these brave men and women who risk their lives every day to protect the American people. First responders in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota rushed into danger this weekend to protect innocent people. They certainly saved lives. Now we must do everything we can to ensure justice is [[Page S5873]] served and law enforcement gets the support needed to conduct their investigation. It is not enough to simply offer help after these heinous attacks take place. Congress must do more to prevent these acts of terrorism altogether. There are things we can do, and some of them are really easy. Right now, as we speak, there is a loophole in our law that allows potential FBI terror suspects to legally purchase guns and explosives. Stop and think about that for just a moment. A person with suspected ties to terrorism can walk into a store now and buy all of the explosives, all the guns, and all the ammunition they want. In Nevada, a man who has been so charitable has set up a camp for children every summer. It costs him lots of money. It is in a beautiful part of the mountain area right outside of Las Vegas. We have, within 10 minutes of Las Vegas, a 12,000-foot mountain. At the foot of those mountains, he has a beautiful camp. Here is what they are doing now. You can go to a gun store in Las Vegas, and you can buy explosives. They put them up in the trees. We don't have that many trees in Nevada. They will put explosives up in a tree, and they shoot at it, and it blows up. It blows up the tree and anything around it. That is for sport. Anyone can walk into a gun store and buy explosives. It doesn't matter who it is. You can also be a terrorist and do the same thing. Again, I ask everyone to think about that. A person with suspected ties to terrorism can walk into a store now and buy all of the explosives they want. They can buy all the guns they want. The so-called terror gap is outrageous and terribly reckless. How can something like this go unaddressed in modern-day America? Democrats have tried repeatedly for the past year to close that loophole, but we have been prevented from doing that by the Republicans. We can argue from now on about whether this bill could have prevented this weekend's attacks, but one thing is for sure: It could prevent the next attack. But we know this loophole shouldn't exist. We know terror suspects shouldn't be given a free pass to buy all the guns and all the explosives they want, and we know the American people want this loophole closed. Eighty-five percent of the people in Indiana, in Nevada, in Kentucky--85 percent of the people in America--support legislation keeping explosives and guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists. If you can't fly, why should you be able to buy a gun? If you can't fly, why should you be able to buy explosives? The only reason the FBI terror suspects are allowed to buy guns and explosives is simply because of Republican opposition. That is the reason. This state of affairs defies belief. It is hard to believe that in America today an FBI terror suspect who cannot fly on an airplane can walk into a gun store in Las Vegas, New York City, or anyplace and legally purchase explosives and assault weapons. But it is true because Republicans refuse to close the terror gap loophole. In the aftermath of these attacks, our constituents are looking for us to help. They want to feel safe. They want to be safe. We can help provide that safety by closing the terror loophole, but Democrats can't do it alone. We need help from the Republicans. Mr. President, I see no one seeking recognition, so I ask the Chair to announce the business of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S5872-S5873] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TERROR ATTACKS IN NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK, AND MINNESOTA Mr. REID.

The so-called terror gap is outrageous and terribly reckless. How can something like this go unaddressed in modern-day America? Democrats have tried repeatedly for the past year to close that loophole, but we have been prevented from doing that by the Republicans. We can argue from now on about whether this bill could have prevented this weekend's attacks, but one thing is for sure: It could prevent the next attack. But we know this loophole shouldn't exist. We know terror suspects shouldn't be given a free pass to buy all the guns and all the explosives they want, and we know the American people want this loophole closed. Eighty-five percent of the people in Indiana, in Nevada, in Kentucky--85 percent of the people in America--support legislation keeping explosives and guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists. If you can't fly, why should you be able to buy a gun? If you can't fly, why should you be able to buy explosives? The only reason the FBI terror suspects are allowed to buy guns and explosives is simply because of Republican opposition. That is the reason. This state of affairs defies belief. It is hard to believe that in America today an FBI terror suspect who cannot fly on an airplane can walk into a gun store in Las Vegas, New York City, or anyplace and legally purchase explosives and assault weapons. But it is true because Republicans refuse to close the terror gap loophole. In the aftermath of these attacks, our constituents are looking for us to help. They want to feel safe. They want to be safe. We can help provide that safety by closing the terror loophole, but Democrats can't do it alone. We need help from the Republicans. Mr. President, I see no one seeking recognition, so I ask the Chair to announce the business of the day. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S5872-S5873] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TERROR ATTACKS IN NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK, AND MINNESOTA Mr. REID. Mr. President, many Americans are taking the news about this weekend's terror attacks in New Jersey, New York, and even Minnesota very seriously. As a country, we are always stunned when these violent acts occur, and we are absolutely sickened by the acts of violence of this terrorist activity. We grieve with the victims, their families, and their loved ones. I had a long, thorough briefing today by the FBI. I appreciate their good work always. They have a difficult job doing everything they can to make sure we are safe. I am aware of the many people injured in these cowardly attacks, including police officers. I wish them all a full and complete recovery. Despite the many injured, we are very grateful that no one was killed in these attacks. It is a credit to both law enforcement and America's terrific, good, brave first responders. Earlier today, the suspect wanted in connection with these cowardly attacks was shot and apprehended by police officers, but, of course, not before he wounded two of these police officers. These officers' quick response most likely kept Americans safe. These events remind us of these brave men and women who risk their lives every day to protect the American people. First responders in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota rushed into danger this weekend to protect innocent people. They certainly saved lives. Now we must do everything we can to ensure justice is [[Page S5873]] served and law enforcement gets the support needed to conduct their investigation. It is not enough to simply offer help after these heinous attacks take place. Congress must do more to prevent these acts of terrorism altogether. There are things we can do, and some of them are really easy. Right now, as we speak, there is a loophole in our law that allows potential FBI terror suspects to legally purchase guns and explosives. Stop and think about that for just a moment. A person with suspected ties to terrorism can walk into a store now and buy all of the explosives, all the guns, and all the ammunition they want. In Nevada, a man who has been so charitable has set up a camp for children every summer. It costs him lots of money. It is in a beautiful part of the mountain area right outside of Las Vegas. We have, within 10 minutes of Las Vegas, a 12,000-foot mountain. At the foot of those mountains, he has a beautiful camp. Here is what they are doing now. You can go to a gun store in Las Vegas, and you can buy explosives. They put them up in the trees. We don't have that many trees in Nevada. They will put explosives up in a tree, and they shoot at it, and it blows up. It blows up the tree and anything around it. That is for sport. Anyone can walk into a gun store and buy explosives. It doesn't matter who it is. You can also be a terrorist and do the same thing. Again, I ask everyone to think about that. A person with suspected ties to terrorism can walk into a store now and buy all of the explosives they want. They can buy all the guns they want. The so-called terror gap is outrageous and terribly reckless. How can something like this go unaddressed in modern-day America?

Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of H.R. 5985, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 5985) to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend certain expiring provisions of law administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized. [[Page S5877]] Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague, the chairman of the VA Committee, here. I will happily yield to him to speak first, or I can proceed and then yield to him afterwards. Mr. ISAKSON. I appreciate that. I yield to the Senator from Connecticut to begin. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to be here today to speak in support of H.R. 5985, the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act. We will vote on it shortly. I thank my colleagues for what I expect to be an overwhelmingly positive vote to affirm our commitment to the veterans of America and that neither dysfunction nor distraction of what is happening during this season of elections will prevent us from keeping the lights on in the Veterans Affairs Department. As its name implies, this measure would maintain 27 vital ongoing programs and services that the VA provides through the next year. I commend Chairman Miller and Ranking Member Takano in the House for drafting this bipartisan measure that is so important and necessary. We have worked collaboratively with them. Chairman Isakson and I have met with them numerous times, and it has truly been a cooperative and collaborative effort. This legislation authorizes an increase in the existing VA caregivers program of $10 million, going from $724 million to $734 million, as well as a grants program that assists homeless veterans and provides them with support services. The bill we will vote on this evening will also give the Secretary of the VA the exact same power as the Secretary of Education has with respect to title IV in the event of a university's sudden loss of accreditation. It is critically important. As we have seen with ITT and Corinthian, for-profit colleges have abruptly closed, leaving veterans stranded. This bill will empower the VA Secretary to provisionally approve programs for use with the GI bill so that veterans may transition to another course of study. Without this provision becoming law now, veterans who attended those schools like ITT may find themselves in a similar untenable, unacceptable, unfair situation. They lose education benefits and, equally troubling, benefits for their housing and food allowance, which they so critically need. I am pleased we can vote on this measure tonight and send it to the President's desk for his signature. But the simple, stark fact is that this bill is simply a small down payment--a small step in the direction that we must move and that the Senate must accomplish in the days that remain in this session to honor all who have served. It is just one of a series of congressional actions that are needed before we recess to ensure that for-profit schools that put their profits before veterans' rights to an education do not hurt our veterans as their business model collapses. The Senate should also pass the Veterans Education Relief and Reinstatement Act that Senator Tillis of North Carolina and I have introduced. This bill is bipartisan, as is this bill, and would grant an emergency housing stipend to those students who are adversely affected by destabilizing permanent school closures. Corinthian College and, more recently, ITT give a voice and face to this staggeringly real problem for so many veterans who are the victims of the exploitation by these for-profit schools. Our mission of ensuring that no veteran is left behind will not be completed by the vote we take this evening. It is just a down payment. I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting H.R. 5985 and beginning and concluding the hard work of passing other bills that have been reported out of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, with the strong bipartisan work, collaboration, and partnership among the chairman, Senator Isakson, and myself. I thank Senator Isakson for being here this evening, and I will be honored to yield to him now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am honored to join the ranking member, Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut, on this important day. This morning when I woke up, I began preparing for a speech I made at Oglethorpe University at 11 o'clock this morning on Constitution Day, and it reminded me of what an important September day today is. Senator Robert Byrd, the distinguished Democrat, majority leader, and President pro tempore of the Senate for many years and who served here for many decades, amended an appropriations act on September 19, 2004, to designate today as Constitution Day. So it is a great honor for me to speak on the floor to honor our veterans on the day we honor our Constitution because, without our veterans, there would be no Constitution. Without those who fight to defend our freedom and our liberty around the world, there would be no Constitution. So it is a great day to do this. I wish to express my agreement with exactly what Senator Blumenthal said. This is a mere down payment. It is an acknowledgment. There is lots of work to be done. Critically, though, this extender bill addresses any number of programs in the VA that will expire at the end of the fiscal year unless they are extended. Most importantly are homeless programs, which are critically important, and adaptive sports programs, which are critically important as well. So by adopting this bill, our homeless programs will stay in place and our adaptive sports programs will stay in place. As Senator Blumenthal said, should the Secretary of Education shut down an institution midterm, this provides help to that student who is a veteran to see to it that they don't lose their benefit and they can continue their education. Again, this is a small down payment. We have other things yet to be done. Hopefully, they will be done after we come back for the lameduck session after the election. But tonight, all Members of the Senate from both parties--Republicans and Democrats--can help us make a down payment on Constitution Day to those who make our freedom and liberty possible--our veterans of the United States of America. I urge an ``aye'' vote from each Member of the Senate. I yield back the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I yield back all time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the bill pass? Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized. [[Page S5877]] Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague, the chairman of the VA Committee, here. I will happily yield to him to speak first, or I can proceed and then yield to him afterwards. Mr. ISAKSON. I appreciate that. I yield to the Senator from Connecticut to begin. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to be here today to speak in support of H.R. 5985, the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act. We will vote on it shortly. I thank my colleagues for what I expect to be an overwhelmingly positive vote to affirm our commitment to the veterans of America and that neither dysfunction nor distraction of what is happening during this season of elections will prevent us from keeping the lights on in the Veterans Affairs Department. As its name implies, this measure would maintain 27 vital ongoing programs and services that the VA provides through the next year. I commend Chairman Miller and Ranking Member Takano in the House for drafting this bipartisan measure that is so important and necessary. We have worked collaboratively with them. Chairman Isakson and I have met with them numerous times, and it has truly been a cooperative and collaborative effort. This legislation authorizes an increase in the existing VA caregivers program of $10 million, going from $724 million to $734 million, as well as a grants program that assists homeless veterans and provides them with support services. The bill we will vote on this evening will also give the Secretary of the VA the exact same power as the Secretary of Education has with respect to title IV in the event of a university's sudden loss of accreditation. It is critically important. As we have seen with ITT and Corinthian, for-profit colleges have abruptly closed, leaving veterans stranded. This bill will empower the VA Secretary to provisionally approve programs for use with the GI bill so that veterans may transition to another course of study. Without this provision becoming law now, veterans who attended those schools like ITT may find themselves in a similar untenable, unacceptable, unfair situation. They lose education benefits and, equally troubling, benefits for their housing and food allowance, which they so critically need. I am pleased we can vote on this measure tonight and send it to the President's desk for his signature. But the simple, stark fact is that this bill is simply a small down payment--a small step in the direction that we must move and that the Senate must accomplish in the days that remain in this session to honor all who have served. It is just one of a series of congressional actions that are needed before we recess to ensure that for-profit schools that put their profits before veterans' rights to an education do not hurt our veterans as their business model collapses. The Senate should also pass the Veterans Education Relief and Reinstatement Act that Senator Tillis of North Carolina and I have introduced. This bill is bipartisan, as is this bill, and would grant an emergency housing stipend to those students who are adversely affected by destabilizing permanent school closures. Corinthian College and, more recently, ITT give a voice and face to this staggeringly real problem for so many veterans who are the victims of the exploitation by these for-profit schools. Our mission of ensuring that no veteran is left behind will not be completed by the vote we take this evening. It is just a down payment. I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting H.R. 5985 and beginning and concluding the hard work of passing other bills that have been reported out of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, with the strong bipartisan work, collaboration, and partnership among the chairman, Senator Isakson, and myself. I thank Senator Isakson for being here this evening, and I will be honored to yield to him now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am honored to join the ranking member, Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut, on this important day. This morning when I woke up, I began preparing for a speech I made at Oglethorpe University at 11 o'clock this morning on Constitution Day, and it reminded me of what an important September day today is. Senator Robert Byrd, the distinguished Democrat, majority leader, and President pro tempore of the Senate for many years and who served here for many decades, amended an appropriations act on September 19, 2004, to designate today as Constitution Day. So it is a great honor for me to speak on the floor to honor our veterans on the day we honor our Constitution because, without our veterans, there would be no Constitution. Without those who fight to defend our freedom and our liberty around the world, there would be no Constitution. So it is a great day to do this. I wish to express my agreement with exactly what Senator Blumenthal said. This is a mere down payment. It is an acknowledgment. There is lots of work to be done. Critically, though, this extender bill addresses any number of programs in the VA that will expire at the end of the fiscal year unless they are extended. Most importantly are homeless programs, which are critically important, and adaptive sports programs, which are critically important as well. So by adopting this bill, our homeless programs will stay in place and our adaptive sports programs will stay in place. As Senator Blumenthal said, should the Secretary of Education shut down an institution midterm, this provides help to that student who is a veteran to see to it that they don't lose their benefit and they can continue their education. Again, this is a small down payment. We have other things yet to be done. Hopefully, they will be done after we come back for the lameduck session after the election. But tonight, all Members of the Senate from both parties--Republicans and Democrats--can help us make a down payment on Constitution Day to those who make our freedom and liberty possible--our veterans of the United States of America. I urge an ``aye'' vote from each Member of the Senate. I yield back the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I yield back all time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the bill pass? Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Scott), the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions), and the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Sullivan). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Johnson) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Scott) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons), the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent. I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine) would vote yea. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

CREC-2016-09-19-pt1-PgS5878-2,CREC-2016-09-19,114,VOTING RIGHTS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S5878] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VOTING RIGHTS Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last year our country celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the most important pieces of legislation that was passed in the 20th century. It opened the door for millions of Americans to exercise their constitutional right to vote. But this year will mark the first Presidential election in half a century without the full protections guaranteed by that landmark law. One of the worst decisions this corporate-dominated Supreme Court made was Shelby County v. Holder, which struck down a key part of the law, taking the teeth out of provisions that protect voters from suppression laws. Since that misguided decision, States across the country have passed new voting restrictions that would disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Americans. At least 17 States have passed new voting restrictions since the Shelby County restriction. We know who is hurt most by these laws--African Americans, Latinos, young people, and seniors. In North Carolina, before enacting one of these laws, the State legislature specifically asked for data on voting patterns by race. Once they had this data, they decided to eliminate or limit the voting methods used by African-American voters. Thankfully, the Fourth Circuit Court struck down this blatant attempt to disenfranchise one group of voters, writing: ``The new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision.'' In my State of Ohio, the courts have shamefully allowed laws such as these to stay on the books. Last week we were dealt multiple blows. First, the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal on the Sixth Circuit's decision ending ``Golden Week''--created by a Republican legislature a decade ago--when voters can register and vote on the same day during the 1 week early-voting period. In May, Judge Watson--a George W. Bush appointee in the Southern District in Columbus--found that the laws limiting early voting and registration would disproportionately impact African Americans. Judge Watson did the right thing, but the ultraconservative Sixth Circuit ruled to overturn that ruling, ending ``Golden Week.'' Last week the Supreme Court nodded 4 to 4 because the Republican majority leader won't let the Senate do its job to have hearings and confirmation on Judge Garland. The Supreme Court declined to intervene. Then the Sixth Circuit overturned a lower court ruling that had thrown out new Ohio laws imposing stricter requirements on absentee and provisional voters. Judge Damon Keith's dissent in this case captured what these restrictions are really all about. He notes that during the committee debate over the law, one legislator asked: ``Should we really be making it easier for those people who take the bus after church on Sunday to vote?''--making it crystal clear exactly what they were targeting and whom they were targeting. Judge Keith continues: Democracies die behind closed doors. Voting is the ultimate expression of self-government. Instead of making it easier for all persons, unrestrained and unfettered, to exercise this fundamental right to vote, legislators are making it harder. States are audaciously nullifying a right for which our ancestors relentlessly fought and--in some instances--even tragically died. I would point out that only about a decade ago, this body and the House overwhelmingly, bipartisanly renewed the Voting Rights Act that the Court struck down. Now one political party is digging in in opposition to that. It is no secret what these laws are about. State legislators have made it perfectly clear. In 2008, African Americans voted early in person at a rate more than 20 times greater than White voters. We all remember the scenes from Cuyahoga County, Cleveland, in 2004 when some voters waited as long as 7 hours to vote. For hourly workers, college students who work a third shift, parents who have to drop their children off at school, and many others, early voting ensures that their voices will be heard. In 2012, 10 percent of the electorate--600,000 people--voted early in my State. That is 600,000 voices that might not have been heard were it not for early voting. But some judges who dress in suits and lead very privileged lives with generous benefits from taxpayers have decided these voices aren't worth hearing. As Judge Keith said, democracies die behind closed doors. This body refuses to hold a hearing on the nominee who would have allowed the Supreme Court to hear the appeal on the ``Golden Week'' issue and issue a real decision. This body refuses to bring to the floor the bipartisan Voting Rights Advancement Act. In 1981, when signing an extension to the Voting Rights Act, President Reagan called the right to vote ``the crown jewel of American liberties.'' Ronald Reagan would have seen his political party today going in exactly the opposite direction, and that is sad. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S5878] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VOTING RIGHTS Mr. BROWN.

court refused to hear an appeal on the sixth circuit's decision ending ``golden week''--created by a republican legislature a decade ago--when voters can register and vote on the same day during the 1 week early-voting period. in may, judge watson--a george w. bush appointee in the southern district in columbus--found that the laws limiting early voting and registration would disproportionately impact african americans. judge watson did the right thing, but the ultraconservative sixth circuit ruled to overturn that ruling, ending ``golden week.'' last week the supreme court nodded 4 to 4 because the republican majority leader won't let the senate do its job to have hearings and confirmation on judge garland. the supreme court declined to intervene. then the sixth circuit overturned a lower court ruling that had thrown out new ohio laws imposing stricter requirements on absentee and provisional voters. judge damon keith's dissent in this case captured what these restrictions are really all about. he notes that during the committee debate over the law, one legislator asked: ``should we really be making it easier for those people who take the bus after church on sunday to vote?''--making it crystal clear exactly what they were targeting and whom they were targeting. judge keith continues: democracies die behind closed doors. voting is the ultimate expression of self-government. instead of making it easier for all persons, unrestrained and unfettered, to exercise this fundamental right to vote, legislators are making it harder. states are audaciously nullifying a right for which our ancestors relentlessly fought and--in some instances--even tragically died. i would point out that only about a decade ago, this body and the house overwhelmingly, bipartisanly renewed the voting rights act that the court struck down. now one political party is digging in in opposition to that. it is no secret what these laws are about. state legislators have made it perfectly clear. in 2008, african americans voted early in person at a rate more than 20 times greater than white voters. we all remember the scenes from cuyahoga county, cleveland, in 2004 when some voters waited as long as 7 hours to vote. for hourly workers, college students who work a third shift, parents who have to drop their children off at school, and many others, early voting ensures that their voices will be heard. in 2012, 10 percent of the electorate--600,000 people--voted early in my state. that is 600,000 voices that might not have been heard were it not for early voting. but some judges who dress in suits and lead very privileged lives with generous benefits from taxpayers have decided these voices aren't worth hearing. as judge keith said, democracies die behind closed doors. this body refuses to hold a hearing on the nominee who would have allowed the supreme court to hear the appeal on the ``golden week'' issue and issue a real decision. this body refuses to bring to the floor the bipartisan voting rights advancement act. in 1981, when signing an extension to the voting rights act, president reagan called the right to vote ``the crown jewel of american liberties.'' ronald reagan would have seen his political party today going in exactly the opposite direction, and that is sad. ____________________",5104

Mr. President, today, September 19, marks the beginning of National Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, GEAR UP, Week, and I would like to recognize the meaningful work of GEAR UP in Hawaii. Since 1998, GEAR UP has provided support and resources to low-income students across the country to inform them about, prepare for, and succeed in college. GEAR UP helps these students, many who are first- generation college students, overcome the challenges they face in their communities. [[Page S5880]] GEAR UP Hawaii serves over 16,000 students each year from low-income and underserved communities throughout the State in grades 7 through 12 and in their first year in college. The program equips students with the tools they need to succeed in college and their careers. GEAR UP delivers a number of services to students, including supporting early college-level academic preparation in high school, providing opportunities for early college options, increasing college access and financial aid information to students and families, and advising students during their first year of college to increase first-year completion. GEAR UP Hawaii has gained national recognition for its success in closing the achievement gap among groups traditionally underrepresented in higher education and helping low-income students prepare for college. Through its collaborative partnerships between Hawaii's State Department of Education, K-12 schools, the University of Hawaii, local businesses, and community organizations, GEAR UP Hawaii inspires students to see postsecondary education as something they can achieve. The early outreach GEAR UP Hawaii performs is key to improving access to postsecondary education for students from low-income families in our State. The program's results demonstrate that GEAR UP Hawaii is making significant strides towards increasing the number of low-income students who are prepared for and enroll in college. For example, 20 percent of Step Up Scholars, a GEAR UP Hawaii program, graduated from high school in June 2015 with the Board of Education Recognition Diploma, BOERD, compared to 14 percent of students statewide. The BOERD is an honors diploma that requires students to earn a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 and complete a senior project. Additionally, GEAR UP has increased the availability of High School Based Running Start, HBRS, courses, which allow high school students to attend University of Hawaii classes to earn both high school and college credits. For the Hawaii class of 2014, 83 percent of students who took at least one HBRS course enrolled in college the semester after graduation compared to the statewide average of 56 percent. Thanks to these programs, thousands of Hawaii's students graduate from high school every year better prepared for college and for their futures. A college education is a path of opportunity for our students. GEAR UP Hawaii has been and will continue to be critical in supporting the State's goal of having 55 percent of working-age adults in the State earn a college degree by 2025. I commend GEAR UP Hawaii for the vital role it plays in helping Hawaii's students access and excel in their higher education. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S5879-S5880] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GEAR UP HAWAII Mr. SCHATZ.

Mr. President, I rise to honor Seaman 1st Class William W. Welch, a native of Springfield, OH--an American hero who laid down his life for our country during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Seaman Welch was known to his family as Billy. He enlisted in the Navy, as so many did in those days, at 17. He left during his senior year at Springfield Catholic Central High School, so determined was he to serve his country. On December 7, 1941, Welch was stationed on the USS Oklahoma, docked at the U.S. Naval Base at Pearl Harbor. The Oklahoma was the first to be hit that fateful morning by the Japanese. Of the more than 1,300 crew aboard, 429 perished that day--a loss of life second only to the better known USS Arizona. The ship capsized, and Billy Welch was among the first of so many Americans to make the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation during World War II. Billy's grieving family was dealt an additional blow when their son's remains were not returned to them, and they were unable to give him a burial befitting his sacrifice. It wasn't until 1943 that the Navy was able to right the Oklahoma and began trying to identify the remains. By then, with the technology available in the 1940s, it was too late for most sailors. Billy and his fellow sailors were buried as ``unknowns,'' and they had rested in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu until last year. In 2014, Billy Welch's nephew, Michael, contacted my office. He was [[Page S5879]] fighting--for want of a better term--with the Department of Defense, begging them to try to identify his uncle's remains with the new technology available in 2014. He was part of a movement of families and veterans trying to piece together where their loved ones were buried and get them returned home. In 2015, the Pentagon announced plans to exhume and attempt to identify the fallen sailors and soldiers buried in the Pacific. DOD began removing caskets and using dental records and DNA to identify the remains and return those fallen heroes to their families. Billy Welch was identified. Now, with the help of dedicated staff in my office, next month he will finally be returned to Springfield and buried with full military honors in his hometown. It will be my honor to stand with Seaman Welch's family at Saint Joseph Catholic Church in Springfield and witness this hero be shown the honor and appreciation he deserves and his family has been denied for so long. Billy and his fellow sailors may not have known the contribution they were making that day on the USS Oklahoma to future generations at home and around the world as the first to sacrifice their lives fighting tyranny during the Second World War. That makes their actions all the more heroic. There is a reason we call them the ``greatest generation.'' We are losing more and more of that generation with each passing day. Less than 700,000 World War II veterans remain with us. We lose some 430 of those heroes each day. My father, a World War II veteran stationed in New Zealand and Iran--what he always called Persia World War II--passed away back in the year 2000. Projects like this one are all the more important and more timely. We need to identify these sailors and soldiers now, while their loved ones are still with us and still able to pay their proper respects. We owe William Welch and all those who gave their lives for our country a burial and, equally important, a tribute that befits their service and their sacrifice. I will be honored to take part in that tribute for Seaman Welch next month. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a hard-working businessowner, veteran, and respected Kentuckian, Mr. Roy Schott. Mr. Schott recently celebrated 61 years of work as a mechanic and service station owner and 55 years as a U-Haul outlet. His dedication to his work is something to be admired by us all. Mr. Schott's journey began at the age of 15 when he discovered his interest and aptitude in mechanics. This led him to his first job in a garage, where he repaired motor vehicles. In 1951, he left his job and home to serve our country in the Korean war as a motor sergeant. Upon returning to London, KY, from his time in the military, he and a friend opened a service station. Mr. Schott made an addition to his business in 1961 after seeing a U-Haul ad in the paper. The service station became Schott Marathon and U-Haul Dealership. At that time, U- Haul charged only $3 a day to rent a trailer, later adding a $1 fee for hitch rentals. Mr. Schott's secrets to U-Haul success are good help, good customer service, and a good field manager. To this day, he has remained active in his business, coming every day to work alongside his loyal employees and interacting with his customers. After the loss of his wife in 2002, Mr. Schott considered retiring, but ultimately decided that he loves his job too much to ever stop. I am very honored to represent Mr. Schott here in the U.S. Senate and want to wish him congratulations on his many years of service not only to the people of London, KY, but also to this nation. I am sure my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in expressing gratitude and admiration for his service as well. He truly represents the finest of Kentucky. Mr. President, an area publication, the Sentinel-Echo, published a compelling article on Roy Schott's life. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Sentinel-Echo, Aug. 22, 2016] Still Going Strong: Roy Schott Celebrates 61 Years of Keeping Vehicles on the Road (By Nita Johnson) London businessman Roy Schott has many memories. He will share some of those, but often says they are not important. But after 61 years of operating Schott's Service Station on Main Street, he has a lot of memories and a lot of knowledge to go with it. ``Be sure to find out what kind of oil it needs,'' he said to a customer who called his business on Thursday afternoon, before going into the service section and assisting an employee with loosening bolts on a car part. Schott said he got involved in the mechanic business because it paid better than some other vocations available in 1943. ``I started working at a garage that is where the Sentinel- Echo is now,'' he said. ``I got $1.50 a day. Other places only paid $1 a day, except the railroad and it paid $1 an hour.'' Schott learned to weld as part of his job, recalling that parts weren't manufactured then as they are today. ``If a bus came in with a broken window, you had to fix it with a piece of tin,'' he said. Schott left the business in 1951 with many other Laurel Countians who went to serve their country in the Korean War. He served two years during that conflict ``when all hell was going on.'' War is no good memory for Schott, who still tears up when he thinks about the end of World War II. ``When World War II ended, the bell at the courthouse rang all day,'' he said. ``There would be four or five bodies of boys come in every day.'' Schott served as combat engineer in Korea, where he was a motor sergeant and oversaw 23 trucks. He remembers those trying times through a book presented to Korean veterans by the Korean government. The book shows pictures of the devastation during and following the war there, but highlights the achievements made over the years as the country rebuilt. Once safely back home after the Korean War, Schott opened his service station on South Main Street near the former Ormsby Hardware. While also operating his service station, Schott became an authorized U-Haul rental facility. He credits Bill Ormsby for that venture--one that earned him recognition from U-Haul last year for 55 years as an authorized dealer. ``I'm the oldest one in the state, probably the oldest one in the country,'' he laughed. But in 1955, Schott got a loan to start his own business. He remembers that day when his loan was approved. ``It was August 28, 1955,'' he said. ``When you borrow money you know the date you got it.'' He moved the business to its current spot on North Main Street across from London Elementary School in 1960. Now, 56 years later, he continues the tradition he began, still working performing his magic on brakes, tires and air conditioning units. The business has served him well, providing for his four children over the years. He also has grandchildren, of whom he cannot hide his pride. ``Let me tell you about my grandchildren. No, that would take too long,'' he said with a laugh. Schott plans to continue to work until he is no longer able, refusing to retire. When asked if he still works on vehicles himself, he holds out his hands as proof. ``I guess I do,'' he said. He once considered retirement following the death of his wife 14 years ago. But his son-in-law quickly talked him out of it. ``He said, `What are you going to do, climb the walls?' so I decided to stay open,'' he said. He believes working and staying busy is why he continues to be able to serve residents in the London and Laurel areas. ``A friend who retired told me to work all I could,'' he said. ``He said the walls would close in on you after a little while. So when people ask me if I'm going to stay here until they have to carry me out, I tell them I guess they will.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S5879] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO ROY SCHOTT Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, all who knew Ben Craig know that his passing marks the loss of an exceptional family man, local leader, and community banker. Ben was a great neighbor and a shining example of a Kansan who improved the lives of all he knew. The youngest of five children, Ben was born in 1929 to Benjamin D. Craig, Sr., and Orpha (Cox) Craig. He grew up and went to school in Baxter Springs, where he was an avid baseball player and sports fan. During high school, he was the pitcher for the Baxter Whiz Kids, the local regional team. He attended the University of Kansas, and during his college years, he pursued his minor league baseball dreams playing with the New York Yankees and the St. Louis Browns. After the Korean war began in 1950, Ben enlisted in the Air Force and spent 18 months stationed in Tripoli, Libya. Following his deployment, he returned to the States and was stationed at Sewart Air Force Base near Nashville, TN. He was joined by his new bride, Evadean Talbot, who he married after returning home from Tripoli. In 1954, he was honorably discharged from the service as an E-5 tech sergeant. Ben's long career in business began after leaving the Air Force when he took a job with the Cassville, MO, chamber of commerce. He later worked with the Kansas City, KS, chamber before beginning a banking career that would span decades. Ben served as president of Metcalf Bank in Kansas City for 35 years and then as chairman of the board until 2007. When the bank was sold in 2007, Ben remained on the board of directors and served as chairman emeritus until his death. In addition to strengthening the Kansas City economy with his work in the banking community, where small businesses and families alike could depend on Ben for solid financial assistance and advice, Ben served in leadership positions in a number of local charities and service organizations. For 52 years, he had perfect attendance in the Overland Park Rotary Club, which is where I first met him. He also played a key role in establishing many of the Kansas City institutions we know today, such as Johnson County Community College, Shawnee Mission Medical Center, and the Overland Park Chamber of Commerce. Ben was preceded in death by his wife of 52 years, Evadean. He leaves behind his friend and companion of the last 10 years, Vivian Sirratt, along with his daughters, Denise Koonse (Charles), Kellee Hearst (Rex), granddaughters, Amanda Lubiewski (Michael), Kelsey Houchen (Andrew), and great-granddaughters, Abigail and Emily Lubiewski. Ben's dedication to public service and constant desire to find ways he could help others will benefit generations of Kansans to come. He had a kind heart and giving nature. Ben was a natural leader who freely gave his time to all he knew. I am thankful for my friendship with him. May he rest in peace. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S5880] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ REMEMBERING BEN CRAIG Mr. MORAN.

Mr. President, on July 21, 2016, shortly before his 72nd birthday, the United States lost a great man, an outstanding soldier, and an unparalleled advocate for his fellow veterans--and I lost a great friend. Rodger McConnell's legacy will be forever remembered as one of perseverance, passion, a humbling work ethic, and an enduring love of Starbucks coffee. Born in August 1944, Rodger graduated high school in 1962 and found employment with a local gas company for several years. Answering the call of duty, Rodger enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1966. He saw combat in Vietnam as a cavalry troop forward observer for mortars and artillery with the 9th Infantry Division and the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment before his honorable discharge a year later. In his postwar years, Rodger overcame several personal hardships, including homelessness and posttraumatic stress disorder, but he remained undaunted and undefeated. It was these struggles that created an empathetic man, who became a tireless and fearless advocate for other struggling veterans. Eventually receiving a liberal arts degree from Carroll College and a master's degree in K-12 education from Montana State University- Northern, Rodger spent several years as an educator before he retired in 2003 and launched into his unwavering service for veterans in Cascade County. Working with State District Judge Greg Pinski, Rodger helped create a veterans court to help veterans navigate the justice system and get the help and treatment they need to get back on their feet. Rodger also played a pivotal role in constructing the Montana Veterans Memorial, which serves as a landmark in Great Falls to honor those who have served. Most notably, Rodger spearheaded the ``Stand Down'' event in Great Falls, providing veterans with clothing and access to job training and health services. Through this important event, Rodger made a difference in the lives of hundreds of veterans. Rodger was also an extremely active volunteer, contributing to the Great Falls community by registering voters, hosting a radio show on a local Great Falls station, and volunteering with the local Optimist Club. In Rodger's eyes, the community was his family, and he was theirs. Let us now take a moment to recognize the exceptional life of Rodger McConnell and the legacy he left behind. It is a legacy I hope each of us can aspire towards.

From September 15, 2016, through October 15, 2016, in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, the people of the United States will once again celebrate the cultures and traditions and honor the many outstanding contributions of our Hispanic American brothers and sisters. Hispanic Heritage Month, which begins each year on September 15, recognizes the anniversaries of the independence of five Latin American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Mexico and Chile observe their independence days on September 16 and September 18. Since its inception as National Hispanic Heritage Week in 1968, which later became National Hispanic Heritage Month in 1988, Americans have taken this time to not only honor the rich culture and traditions of Hispanic Americans, but also to reflect on the tremendous impact Hispanic Americans have had within their communities and throughout our nation. The tireless efforts of generations of Hispanic Americans have resulted in a better America. America's success is reliant upon the rich heritage and cultural diversity of its people. Hispanic Heritage Month celebrates the many Hispanic leaders and members of our communities who have added to the prosperity of the United States in every facet of our society. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to once again join me in recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month. Throughout America's history, present, and future, the Hispanic community has played and will continue to play a major role in enriching the quality of life for the people of the United States, and for their outstanding contributions they are worthy of our respect and gratitude. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1287] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate GAM Graphics and Marketing in Sterling, Virginia who celebrated their 40th anniversary this July. Opened by Charles Grant in 1976, GAM Graphics and Marketing provides quality printing and commercial services to countless citizens throughout our great Commonwealth. GAM was founded in the 1970s with the mission of teaching marketable job skills to students. Originally the printing was done by the students, mainly serving churches and mission groups; however commercial requests started in 1976. Within five years GAM was producing print products ranging from business cards to full-bound books and bulk mailings. GAM is a company run with compassion and a focus on providing excellent quality and service to their clients. In 1985, Nathaniel Grant took the reins at GAM and with his leadership the company continued to grow. Nathaniel and his sister Faith purchased the company from their parents in 1996. Under the guidance of Nathaniel and Faith, GAM modernized and the company continued to grow without any adverse effect on their excellent quality and service. In closing Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in sending our most sincere appreciation to a company that has given so much to their neighbors. The Grant Family and the staff of GAM Graphics and Marketing serve as an example to all. On behalf of Virginia's 10th Congressional District I wish them continued success in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1287] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF GAM GRAPHICS AND MARKETING'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

CREC-2016-09-19-pt1-PgE1288,CREC-2016-09-19,114,A RECENT ADOPTED RESOLUTION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1288-E1289] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A RECENT ADOPTED RESOLUTION ______ HON. JOHN J. DUNCAN, JR. of tennessee in the house of representatives Monday, September 19, 2016 Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, on August 9, 2016 I had a conversation with my good friend and Knoxville Attorney James M. Crain. Mr. Crain and I had the opportunity to discuss the federal edict announcing that every public school in America is to allow students to use whichever bathroom they choose. During our conversation Mr. Crain discussed a resolution adopted by the West Knoxville/Knox County Republican Club offered by Mr. Crain. Newscom published an opinion editorial titled, ``A Bathroom of One's Own,'' that is consistent with the adopted resolution. This article is well reasoned and is consistent with the views of many of the people from my District in East Tennessee. I think most people are tired of all the publicity on this issue and wish we could get back to a time when sexual preference was kept purely private. I also believe that the Federal government should have very limited power over the decisions State and local governments make about their schools. This has long been my position. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to the attention of my Colleagues and other readers of the Record the resolution adopted by the West Knoxville/Knox County Republican Club and the article that ran in The Weekly Standard on June 7, 2016. A Bathroom of One's Own--Newscom Two weeks ago the Obama administration issued a federal edict decreeing that every public school in America allow students to use whichever bathroom they choose, under pain of lawsuit and/or loss of federal funding. Less than a week after that, New York City's Commission on Human Rights issued its own edict, declaring that anyone under the city's rule who refused to use the preferred gender pronouns in dealing with transgender individuals--he, she, ``xe,'' or ``hir''--would be guilty of harassment and subject to penalties up to $125,000 for the first infraction and $250,000 ``for violations that are the result of willful, wanton, or malicious conduct.'' As law professor Eugene Volokh noted, the use of the term ``harassment'' is important, because it means that employers and businesses are responsible not just for their own behavior but for the behavior of their employees and customers. And New York is, if you can imagine it, behind the times. Out in Oregon, Leo Spell, a fifth-grade teacher in the Gresham-Barlow school district, decided she was transgender. (Soell made this decision public only after receiving tenure.) Soell's transition took the form of insisting that she was neither male nor female and demanding that her colleagues refer to her as ``they.'' When other teachers continued to call Soell ``she'' and ``her'' and ``Miss Soell,'' Soell filed a harassment complaint. The school district settled with they for $60,000 and promised to initiate a sweeping set of transgender reforms. To hammer home the power dynamic, the school district claimed, in the statement accompanying the payout, that it was quite ``pleased'' with the outcome. If you think that's depressing, it could always be worse. In Canada, the minister of justice recently introduced legislation banning discrimination based on ``gender identity'' and ``gender expression,'' which could join previous legislation criminalizing anti-trans ``hate propaganda.'' Should the bill pass, you could do up to two years, hard time, if you think the wrong thoughts or say the wrong words. If this all seems like an inordinate amount of heavy artillery for an infinitesimally tiny issue, that's actually the point. Much as fights in academia are so bitter because the stakes are so small, transgender activists are crushingly authoritarian because the justice of their cause is so uncertain. What the trans project lacks in moral and logical clarity, it hopes to overcome with vehemence and intimidation. The confusion is abundant. If you tell a transgender activist that gender is determined biologically, through chromosomal composition, they reply, Well, what about people with Klinefelter (XXY) syndrome? But even with Klinefelter's chromosomal anomalies, only a very small proportion of persons will fall into a category of ``intersex.'' As National Review's Celina Durgin points out, arguments about the tiny, tiny sliver of the population who are biologically considered ``intersex'' actually run counter to transgender ideology, which places ``gender identity''--a self-discovered concept--on a separate plane above mere biology. In other words, if being biologically XX is irrelevant to whether or not you are a girl, then why should it matter if you're XXY? Resorting to arguments about the intersexed is actually an admission of the primacy of biology. Or consider ``gender fluidity,'' another pillar of the transgender project. According to this precept, some people may be one gender on Monday and another on Tuesday. Who can say which is which, or who is when? Not you. The individual is what he/she/they/xe/hir says at any given moment. And once you've divorced gender from biology and agreed that someone who is chromosomally XY can be a woman, you have no valid reason to object if, the next day, she says she is a man again. If you sign on for transgenderism, you're signing on for gender fluidity, too. It doesn't stop there, of course. Once you shoot past gender fluidity and the nongendered ``theys'' like Leo Soell and ``pangenders'' (who claim to be everything rolled into one), there's a whole other universe of gender identities out there. For instance, ``otherkin.'' What are ``otherkin''? Otherkin is the gender identity of people who believe that they are nonhuman. Last summer Vice.com profiled a fellow who identifies as a fox. Some identify as dogs. Some as lions. Some as dragons. Some otherkin even go through body-modifications to make their physical selves look more like their otherkin identity. The otherkin aren't officially part of the LGBTTQQIAAP alliance yet. But just wait. They're coming. Because to deny them their place at the table--to deny that a human person can be not just an animal, but a creature that does not even exist in the real world--is to put the entire transgender project in jeopardy. Because transgender theory, which posits that the self is infinitely plastic, cannot survive a single limiting precept. Fortunately, we are not yet fighting over the rights of otherkin unicorns. In the here-and-now, we merely have wars over public bathroom and school locker room accommodations. This may seem like a small-scale concern. The Census Bureau and the New York Times tried to estimate the number of transgendered persons in the United States last year and came up with a figure somewhere between 21,000 and 90,000. Or, to put it another way, transgenders probably make up between 0.007 percent and 0.029 percent of the American population. When you're dealing with fractions this small, it's hard to be precise. But because virtue-signaling is the highest form of morality in modern America, the full force of the federal government is being brought to bear on transgender bathroom rights, not only through Obama's federal edict, but through the Obama Justice Department's fight against the state of North Carolina. In March, the elected officials of North Carolina voted on and passed a piece of legislation, HB-2, which was designed to stop the forced march toward mandating that people must be free to use whatever bathroom they desire. (It is instructive to note that the initiatives pushing the transgender agenda are almost never enacted legislatively; they are often rammed through bureaucracies and commissions or accomplished by executive fiat.) HB-2 was not a perfect piece of legislation. But the reaction to it was illuminating. The Charlotte Observer's editorial board proclaimed, ``Yes, the thought of male genitalia in girls' locker rooms--and vice versa--might be distressing to some. But the battle for equality has always been in part about overcoming discomfort . . .'' Which brings us to the final bit of confusion in the transgender project. At the heart of the bathroom issue is a simple question: Is there a valid reason for separate facilities for men and women? Is there any rational justification for having separate bathrooms, or locker rooms, or changing rooms, for men and boys on the one hand, and women and girls on the other? The trans argument, per the Charlotte Observer, is essentially ``no.'' By their logic, if women just need to get over their discomfort at seeing naked men next to them, then there's no reasonable explanation for why women could want their own facilities. Except that this would mean there is no reasonable explanation for why someone who is transgender should prefer one set of facilities over another. If biologically born women need to ``overcome discomfort'' about having naked men around them, why shouldn't a biological man who identifies as a woman not similarly have to overcome his discomfort at being around other naked men? The logical paradox of the transgender bathroom war is that it insists that the type of gender and genitalia in a public facility is completely irrelevant--except to the transgendered, for whom it is of supreme importance. At the end of the day, if you're not in favor of unisex facilities for all--one bathroom for everyone to use--then the transgender case falls apart. Because the transgender project tacitly admits that there are reasons of privacy, modesty, and prudence for segregating the sexes. It merely wishes to trump these concerns from the vast majority for the special pleading of a small, powerful, and illiberal group. It is the very definition of the tyranny of the minority. Resolution The West Knoxville/Knox County Republican Club Whereas, Persons who assert a ``gender identity'' other than their sex are claiming a right to utilize rest room facilities, locker rooms and associated showers with persons of the opposite sex; and Whereas, No such right has existed in the history of mankind; and [[Page E1289]] Whereas, Persons--and particularly females--are made extremely uncomfortable by the presence of persons of the opposite sex in such facilities; and Whereas, There is no way to determine the legitimacy of a claim of ``gender identity,'' thus opening the door to false claims made to gain entrance to such facilities for immoral and illegal purposes; and Whereas, Agencies of the Federal Government have exceeded their lawful authority by construing various Acts of Congress as conferring a right to utilize such facilities designated for persons of the opposite sex upon persons claiming a ``gender identity'' different from their biological sex, to wit: a. On January 7, 2015, the Department of Energy Office for Civil Rights issued a letter construing 34 C.F.R. 106.33 (implementing 20 USC 1681(a)) as requiring that transgender students in schools that receive Federal funds must ``generally'' be allowed to utilize bathrooms and locker rooms assigned to the gender with which they identify. The Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, citing deference to administrative construction, has reinstated a suit by a transgender ``male'' to require her Virginia high school to allow her to use the boys rest room, and b. The Department of Justice has sent a letter to the Governor of North Carolina, asserting that the provisions of North Carolina H.B. 2 violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it treats Transgender persons differently than non- transgender persons by denying all persons the right to use multi-person facilities assigned to persons of the opposite sex, and Whereas, the expanded interpretations set out above will require schools, in particular, to require that schoolchildren share toilet, locker and shower facilities with any person of the opposite sex that claims a different ``gender identity,'' and Whereas, with particular reference to 20 USC 1681(a), this expanded interpretation of ``sex'' will have the effect of mandating that transgendered ``females'' be allowed to try out for and compete in women's sports and, because of the greater strength and speed potential of biological males, will largely destroy the very women's sports programs that the provision was designed to foster, and which it has fostered with great success; Now, therefore, be it Resolved as follows; 1. That the foregoing expansions of these Acts of Congress to create rights never intended or contemplated at the time they were enacted is an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power by the Executive Branch, and must be addressed IMMEDIATELY! 2. That the United States Code must be amended to clarify the erroneous ``interpretation'' placed on it by the Executive Branch by enacting a statute worded substantially as follows: As used in this Code, the word ``sex'' refers only to biological sex unless expressly stated to the contrary. No such reference in this Code either requires or prohibits any particular treatment of transgender individuals unless some particular treatment is expressly stated therein. 3. That since such legislation is certain to be vetoed by our President, the foregoing bill MUST BE PASSED AND PRESENTED TO HIM in a timely manner, so that upon returning it to Congress, ample time for votes to override that veto can be held BEFORE THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. 4. That this resolution be forwarded to our Representative and to both of our Senators, with the notation that failure to vigorously pursue the passage of the above statute will be construed by the Club as your agreement with these unconstitutional actions by the Executive Branch. 5. The undersigned officers of the West Knoxville/Knox County Republican Club execute this resolution in their capacities as officers only, and that the undersigned represent that this Resolution was passed without opposition by the voting members present at the June 13, 2016 meeting of the club. Resolved by the Club this the 13th day of June, 2016 Gary Loe, Vice President. Paul E.

Mr. Speaker, on August 9, 2016 I had a conversation with my good friend and Knoxville Attorney James M. Crain. Mr. Crain and I had the opportunity to discuss the federal edict announcing that every public school in America is to allow students to use whichever bathroom they choose. During our conversation Mr. Crain discussed a resolution adopted by the West Knoxville/Knox County Republican Club offered by Mr. Crain. Newscom published an opinion editorial titled, ``A Bathroom of One's Own,'' that is consistent with the adopted resolution. This article is well reasoned and is consistent with the views of many of the people from my District in East Tennessee. I think most people are tired of all the publicity on this issue and wish we could get back to a time when sexual preference was kept purely private. I also believe that the Federal government should have very limited power over the decisions State and local governments make about their schools. This has long been my position. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to the attention of my Colleagues and other readers of the Record the resolution adopted by the West Knoxville/Knox County Republican Club and the article that ran in The Weekly Standard on June 7, 2016. A Bathroom of One's Own--Newscom Two weeks ago the Obama administration issued a federal edict decreeing that every public school in America allow students to use whichever bathroom they choose, under pain of lawsuit and/or loss of federal funding. Less than a week after that, New York City's Commission on Human Rights issued its own edict, declaring that anyone under the city's rule who refused to use the preferred gender pronouns in dealing with transgender individuals--he, she, ``xe,'' or ``hir''--would be guilty of harassment and subject to penalties up to $125,000 for the first infraction and $250,000 ``for violations that are the result of willful, wanton, or malicious conduct.'' As law professor Eugene Volokh noted, the use of the term ``harassment'' is important, because it means that employers and businesses are responsible not just for their own behavior but for the behavior of their employees and customers. And New York is, if you can imagine it, behind the times. Out in Oregon, Leo Spell, a fifth-grade teacher in the Gresham-Barlow school district, decided she was transgender. (Soell made this decision public only after receiving tenure.) Soell's transition took the form of insisting that she was neither male nor female and demanding that her colleagues refer to her as ``they.'' When other teachers continued to call Soell ``she'' and ``her'' and ``Miss Soell,'' Soell filed a harassment complaint. The school district settled with they for $60,000 and promised to initiate a sweeping set of transgender reforms. To hammer home the power dynamic, the school district claimed, in the statement accompanying the payout, that it was quite ``pleased'' with the outcome. If you think that's depressing, it could always be worse. In Canada, the minister of justice recently introduced legislation banning discrimination based on ``gender identity'' and ``gender expression,'' which could join previous legislation criminalizing anti-trans ``hate propaganda.'' Should the bill pass, you could do up to two years, hard time, if you think the wrong thoughts or say the wrong words. If this all seems like an inordinate amount of heavy artillery for an infinitesimally tiny issue, that's actually the point. Much as fights in academia are so bitter because the stakes are so small, transgender activists are crushingly authoritarian because the justice of their cause is so uncertain. What the trans project lacks in moral and logical clarity, it hopes to overcome with vehemence and intimidation. The confusion is abundant. If you tell a transgender activist that gender is determined biologically, through chromosomal composition, they reply, Well, what about people with Klinefelter (XXY) syndrome? But even with Klinefelter's chromosomal anomalies, only a very small proportion of persons will fall into a category of ``intersex.'' As National Review's Celina Durgin points out, arguments about the tiny, tiny sliver of the population who are biologically considered ``intersex'' actually run counter to transgender ideology, which places ``gender identity''--a self-discovered concept--on a separate plane above mere biology. In other words, if being biologically XX is irrelevant to whether or not you are a girl, then why should it matter if you're XXY? Resorting to arguments about the intersexed is actually an admission of the primacy of biology. Or consider ``gender fluidity,'' another pillar of the transgender project. According to this precept, some people may be one gender on Monday and another on Tuesday. Who can say which is which, or who is when? Not you. The individual is what he/she/they/xe/hir says at any given moment. And once you've divorced gender from biology and agreed that someone who is chromosomally XY can be a woman, you have no valid reason to object if, the next day, she says she is a man again. If you sign on for transgenderism, you're signing on for gender fluidity, too. It doesn't stop there, of course. Once you shoot past gender fluidity and the nongendered ``theys'' like Leo Soell and ``pangenders'' (who claim to be everything rolled into one), there's a whole other universe of gender identities out there. For instance, ``otherkin.'' What are ``otherkin''? Otherkin is the gender identity of people who believe that they are nonhuman. Last summer Vice.com profiled a fellow who identifies as a fox. Some identify as dogs. Some as lions. Some as dragons. Some otherkin even go through body-modifications to make their physical selves look more like their otherkin identity. The otherkin aren't officially part of the LGBTTQQIAAP alliance yet. But just wait. They're coming. Because to deny them their place at the table--to deny that a human person can be not just an animal, but a creature that does not even exist in the real world--is to put the entire transgender project in jeopardy. Because transgender theory, which posits that the self is infinitely plastic, cannot survive a single limiting precept. Fortunately, we are not yet fighting over the rights of otherkin unicorns. In the here-and-now, we merely have wars over public bathroom and school locker room accommodations. This may seem like a small-scale concern. The Census Bureau and the New York Times tried to estimate the number of transgendered persons in the United States last year and came up with a figure somewhere between 21,000 and 90,000. Or, to put it another way, transgenders probably make up between 0.007 percent and 0.029 percent of the American population. When you're dealing with fractions this small, it's hard to be precise. But because virtue-signaling is the highest form of morality in modern America, the full force of the federal government is being brought to bear on transgender bathroom rights, not only through Obama's federal edict, but through the Obama Justice Department's fight against the state of North Carolina. In March, the elected officials of North Carolina voted on and passed a piece of legislation, HB-2, which was designed to stop the forced march toward mandating that people must be free to use whatever bathroom they desire. (It is instructive to note that the initiatives pushing the transgender agenda are almost never enacted legislatively; they are often rammed through bureaucracies and commissions or accomplished by executive fiat.) HB-2 was not a perfect piece of legislation. But the reaction to it was illuminating. The Charlotte Observer's editorial board proclaimed, ``Yes, the thought of male genitalia in girls' locker rooms--and vice versa--might be distressing to some. But the battle for equality has always been in part about overcoming discomfort . . .'' Which brings us to the final bit of confusion in the transgender project. At the heart of the bathroom issue is a simple question: Is there a valid reason for separate facilities for men and women? Is there any rational justification for having separate bathrooms, or locker rooms, or changing rooms, for men and boys on the one hand, and women and girls on the other? The trans argument, per the Charlotte Observer, is essentially ``no.'' By their logic, if women just need to get over their discomfort at seeing naked men next to them, then there's no reasonable explanation for why women could want their own facilities. Except that this would mean there is no reasonable explanation for why someone who is transgender should prefer one set of facilities over another. If biologically born women need to ``overcome discomfort'' about having naked men around them, why shouldn't a biological man who identifies as a woman not similarly have to overcome his discomfort at being around other naked men? The logical paradox of the transgender bathroom war is that it insists that the type of gender and genitalia in a public facility is completely irrelevant--except to the transgendered, for whom it is of supreme importance. At the end of the day, if you're not in favor of unisex facilities for all--one bathroom for everyone to use--then the transgender case falls apart. Because the transgender project tacitly admits that there are reasons of privacy, modesty, and prudence for segregating the sexes. It merely wishes to trump these concerns from the vast majority for the special pleading of a small, powerful, and illiberal group. It is the very definition of the tyranny of the minority. Resolution The West Knoxville/Knox County Republican Club Whereas, Persons who assert a ``gender identity'' other than their sex are claiming a right to utilize rest room facilities, locker rooms and associated showers with persons of the opposite sex; and Whereas, No such right has existed in the history of mankind; and [[Page E1289]] Whereas, Persons--and particularly females--are made extremely uncomfortable by the presence of persons of the opposite sex in such facilities; and Whereas, There is no way to determine the legitimacy of a claim of ``gender identity,'' thus opening the door to false claims made to gain entrance to such facilities for immoral and illegal purposes; and Whereas, Agencies of the Federal Government have exceeded their lawful authority by construing various Acts of Congress as conferring a right to utilize such facilities designated for persons of the opposite sex upon persons claiming a ``gender identity'' different from their biological sex, to wit: a. On January 7, 2015, the Department of Energy Office for Civil Rights issued a letter construing 34 C.F.R. 106.33 (implementing 20 USC 1681(a)) as requiring that transgender students in schools that receive Federal funds must ``generally'' be allowed to utilize bathrooms and locker rooms assigned to the gender with which they identify. The Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, citing deference to administrative construction, has reinstated a suit by a transgender ``male'' to require her Virginia high school to allow her to use the boys rest room, and b. The Department of Justice has sent a letter to the Governor of North Carolina, asserting that the provisions of North Carolina H.B. 2 violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it treats Transgender persons differently than non- transgender persons by denying all persons the right to use multi-person facilities assigned to persons of the opposite sex, and Whereas, the expanded interpretations set out above will require schools, in particular, to require that schoolchildren share toilet, locker and shower facilities with any person of the opposite sex that claims a different ``gender identity,'' and Whereas, with particular reference to 20 USC 1681(a), this expanded interpretation of ``sex'' will have the effect of mandating that transgendered ``females'' be allowed to try out for and compete in women's sports and, because of the greater strength and speed potential of biological males, will largely destroy the very women's sports programs that the provision was designed to foster, and which it has fostered with great success; Now, therefore, be it Resolved as follows; 1. That the foregoing expansions of these Acts of Congress to create rights never intended or contemplated at the time they were enacted is an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power by the Executive Branch, and must be addressed IMMEDIATELY! 2. That the United States Code must be amended to clarify the erroneous ``interpretation'' placed on it by the Executive Branch by enacting a statute worded substantially as follows: As used in this Code, the word ``sex'' refers only to biological sex unless expressly stated to the contrary. No such reference in this Code either requires or prohibits any particular treatment of transgender individuals unless some particular treatment is expressly stated therein. 3. That since such legislation is certain to be vetoed by our President, the foregoing bill MUST BE PASSED AND PRESENTED TO HIM in a timely manner, so that upon returning it to Congress, ample time for votes to override that veto can be held BEFORE THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. 4. That this resolution be forwarded to our Representative and to both of our Senators, with the notation that failure to vigorously pursue the passage of the above statute will be construed by the Club as your agreement with these unconstitutional actions by the Executive Branch. 5. The undersigned officers of the West Knoxville/Knox County Republican Club execute this resolution in their capacities as officers only, and that the undersigned represent that this Resolution was passed without opposition by the voting members present at the June 13, 2016 meeting of the club. Resolved by the Club this the 13th day of June, 2016 Gary Loe, Vice President. Paul E. Wehmeier, President. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1288-E1289] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A RECENT ADOPTED RESOLUTION ______ HON.

(it is instructive to note that the initiatives pushing the transgender agenda are almost never enacted legislatively; they are often rammed through bureaucracies and commissions or accomplished by executive fiat.) hb-2 was not a perfect piece of legislation. but the reaction to it was illuminating. the charlotte observer's editorial board proclaimed, ``yes, the thought of male genitalia in girls' locker rooms--and vice versa--might be distressing to some. but the battle for equality has always been in part about overcoming discomfort . . .'' which brings us to the final bit of confusion in the transgender project. at the heart of the bathroom issue is a simple question: is there a valid reason for separate facilities for men and women? is there any rational justification for having separate bathrooms, or locker rooms, or changing rooms, for men and boys on the one hand, and women and girls on the other? the trans argument, per the charlotte observer, is essentially ``no.'' by their logic, if women just need to get over their discomfort at seeing naked men next to them, then there's no reasonable explanation for why women could want their own facilities. except that this would mean there is no reasonable explanation for why someone who is transgender should prefer one set of facilities over another. if biologically born women need to ``overcome discomfort'' about having naked men around them, why shouldn't a biological man who identifies as a woman not similarly have to overcome his discomfort at being around other naked men? the logical paradox of the transgender bathroom war is that it insists that the type of gender and genitalia in a public facility is completely irrelevant--except to the transgendered, for whom it is of supreme importance. at the end of the day, if you're not in favor of unisex facilities for all--one bathroom for everyone to use--then the transgender case falls apart. because the transgender project tacitly admits that there are reasons of privacy, modesty, and prudence for segregating the sexes. it merely wishes to trump these concerns from the vast majority for the special pleading of a small, powerful, and illiberal group. it is the very definition of the tyranny of the minority. resolution the west knoxville/knox county republican club whereas, persons who assert a ``gender identity'' other than their sex are claiming a right to utilize rest room facilities, locker rooms and associated showers with persons of the opposite sex; and whereas, no such right has existed in the history of mankind; and [[page e1289]] whereas, persons--and particularly females--are made extremely uncomfortable by the presence of persons of the opposite sex in such facilities; and whereas, there is no way to determine the legitimacy of a claim of ``gender identity,'' thus opening the door to false claims made to gain entrance to such facilities for immoral and illegal purposes; and whereas, agencies of the federal government have exceeded their lawful authority by construing various acts of congress as conferring a right to utilize such facilities designated for persons of the opposite sex upon persons claiming a ``gender identity'' different from their biological sex, to wit: a. on january 7, 2015, the department of energy office for civil rights issued a letter construing 34 c.f.r. 106.33 (implementing 20 usc 1681(a)) as requiring that transgender students in schools that receive federal funds must ``generally'' be allowed to utilize bathrooms and locker rooms assigned to the gender with which they identify. the court of appeals for the 4th circuit, citing deference to administrative construction, has reinstated a suit by a transgender ``male'' to require her virginia high school to allow her to use the boys rest room, and b. the department of justice has sent a letter to the governor of north carolina, asserting that the provisions of north carolina h.b. 2 violates the civil rights act of 1964 because it treats transgender persons differently than non- transgender persons by denying all persons the right to use multi-person facilities assigned to persons of the opposite sex, and whereas, the expanded interpretations set out above will require schools, in particular, to require that schoolchildren share toilet, locker and shower facilities with any person of the opposite sex that claims a different ``gender identity,'' and whereas, with particular reference to 20 usc 1681(a), this expanded interpretation of ``sex'' will have the effect of mandating that transgendered ``females'' be allowed to try out for and compete in women's sports and, because of the greater strength and speed potential of biological males, will largely destroy the very women's sports programs that the provision was designed to foster, and which it has fostered with great success; now, therefore, be it resolved as follows; 1. that the foregoing expansions of these acts of congress to create rights never intended or contemplated at the time they were enacted is an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power by the executive branch, and must be addressed immediately! 2. that the united states code must be amended to clarify the erroneous ``interpretation'' placed on it by the executive branch by enacting a statute worded substantially as follows: as used in this code, the word ``sex'' refers only to biological sex unless expressly stated to the contrary. no such reference in this code either requires or prohibits any particular treatment of transgender individuals unless some particular treatment is expressly stated therein. 3. that since such legislation is certain to be vetoed by our president, the foregoing bill must be passed and presented to him in a timely manner, so that upon returning it to congress, ample time for votes to override that veto can be held before the election in november. 4. that this resolution be forwarded to our representative and to both of our senators, with the notation that failure to vigorously pursue the passage of the above statute will be construed by the club as your agreement with these unconstitutional actions by the executive branch. 5. the undersigned officers of the west knoxville/knox county republican club execute this resolution in their capacities as officers only, and that the undersigned represent that this resolution was passed without opposition by the voting members present at the june 13, 2016 meeting of the club. resolved by the club this the 13th day of june, 2016 gary loe, vice president. paul e. wehmeier, president. ____________________",14304

BILL SHUSTER of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Monday, September 19, 2016 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, in accordance with House Report 114-589, Part 1, I submit the following Congressional Budget Cost Estimate for H.R. 4487. Congressional Budget Office, U.S. Congress, Washington, DC, July 5, 2016. Hon. Bill Shuster, Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4487, the Public Buildings Reform and Savings Act of 2016. If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Matthew Pickford. Sincerely, Keith Hall. Enclosure. H.R. 4487--Public Buildings Reform and Savings Act of 2016 H.R. 4487 would amend federal law to provide new authorities to the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service (FPS) to manage federal real estate assets and security at those facilities. The act also would require GSA to prepare a number of reports for the Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to complete an audit of GSA's national broker contract. Finally, the legislation would require that lactation rooms be available in all federal buildings that are open to the public. Based on information from GSA and the FPS, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4487 would cost $3 million over the 2017-2021 period, mostly for GSA to prepare reports on a variety of subjects, including a comparison of the cost of owning or leasing space, an explanation of why the costs of construction projects exceed their initial estimates, a review of current rental rates, and an analysis of the use of refrigerants in equipment installed in federal buildings. CBO also estimates that it would cost GAO less than $500,000 annually to prepare the required audit. Based on information from GSA, CBO estimates that the act's requirements to establish lactation rooms in federal buildings would have an insignificant cost because it would apply only to federal buildings that are open to the public and that have lactation rooms designated for use by federal employees. Finally, CBO estimates that providing the FPS with additional law enforcement authorities would not have a significant cost. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4487 would not increase direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2027. CBO also reviewed provisions of the legislation that would require GSA to build a new headquarters for the Department of Energy (DOE), to be financed by exchanging or selling DOE's current headquarters in the Forrestal Building Complex in Washington, D.C. Based on information from GSA and property developers, CBO expects that constructing a new DOE headquarters could not be accomplished solely through a sale or exchange of the current facility, and would require the expenditure of additional appropriated funds, which are not authorized by this act. Under H.R. 4487, if a new headquarters facility could not be built, GSA would be directed to sell any underutilized or vacant property in the Forrestal Complex. Based on information from GSA, CBO does not expect that enacting the bill would result in more sales than would otherwise occur under current law. H.R. 4487 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew Pickford. The estimate was approved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.

Based on information from GSA, CBO estimates that the act's requirements to establish lactation rooms in federal buildings would have an insignificant cost because it would apply only to federal buildings that are open to the public and that have lactation rooms designated for use by federal employees. Finally, CBO estimates that providing the FPS with additional law enforcement authorities would not have a significant cost. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4487 would not increase direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2027. CBO also reviewed provisions of the legislation that would require GSA to build a new headquarters for the Department of Energy (DOE), to be financed by exchanging or selling DOE's current headquarters in the Forrestal Building Complex in Washington, D.C. Based on information from GSA and property developers, CBO expects that constructing a new DOE headquarters could not be accomplished solely through a sale or exchange of the current facility, and would require the expenditure of additional appropriated funds, which are not authorized by this act. Under H.R. 4487, if a new headquarters facility could not be built, GSA would be directed to sell any underutilized or vacant property in the Forrestal Complex. Based on information from GSA, CBO does not expect that enacting the bill would result in more sales than would otherwise occur under current law. H.R. 4487 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew Pickford. The estimate was approved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.

Last month, the Koch Farm was honored by the Colorado Department of Agriculture and History for its 102 years of contributions to Colorado's agriculture economy, and its deep family roots in the community. The Koch Farm was founded in 1914 at the beginning of World War I. It survived the dust bowl of the 1930s, fluctuating crop prices, and many other harsh conditions that have devastated other Colorado farms over the past decade. As a family, the Kochs were able to persevere, keeping their family's traditions and the farm alive. It's through the hard work and determination of family members like John and Conrad Wyss, the founders of the farm; Mark Koch, the current operator of the farm, and his siblings; and their father, John Koch, who passed away earlier this year, that this farm continues to thrive today. Mr. Speaker, I am immensely proud of the family tradition and determination that the Koch Family Farm embodies. I congratulate the Koch Family Farm for receiving the distinct honor of being designated as a part of the Colorado Department of Agriculture and History homestead collection.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Monday, September 19, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my constituent, Officer Michael ``Mike'' Todd Brunson, a master police officer in the Winchester Police Department. Officer Brunson passed away on September 11th, 2016 at the age of 48. He will be sorely missed by his family, his fellow officers, and his entire community. Mike Brunson was sworn into the Winchester Police Department on February 10, 1995 and was promoted to the position of Master Police Officer in September of 2006. Officer Brunson was a respected and well known member of our community. In addition to protecting his neighbors, Mike helped found his department's community policing unit, and even served as a counselor at the Kids and Cops Camp. Officer Brunson was a member of the SWAT Team, a firearms instructor and field training officer. He also received a Meritorious Action Award and a Valor Award in 2014 for risking his life to enter a burning home in search for a 2 year old boy. Winchester Police Chief Kevin Sanzenbacher in his statement said that Mike ``was a great person, a great father, grandfather, husband, son and friend. He will be truly missed.'' Lt. J. Cornwell of the Frederick County Sheriffs Office had Officer Brunson as his first field training officer and said ``he was a very courteous and nice man who was always willing to pass on information that he had'' and that it was a ``shame to lose him, especially at that young age.'' Officer Mike Brunson is survived by his mother, Carol D. Rockwell, his wife, Kimberly Brunson; his daughter Elizabeth Thurman and her husband Jesse, his daughter Katherine Brunson; a step-daughter, Eve Neal, and step-son, Stephen Neal-Crowe; as well as his two grandchildren Ryleigh Grace and Oliver James Thurman.

GREG WALDEN of oregon in the house of representatives Monday, September 19, 2016 Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend Bob McFadden for his many years of dedicated public service to the Port of The Dalles. Bob has retired after serving 11 years as commissioner and the last two years as President for the Port of The Dalles, and I would like to pay tribute to his leadership for the people of The Dalles. Bob was born near Mollala, Oregon and graduated from Portland's Parkrose High School. Following graduation, Bob studied culinary arts and the hospitality industry at the Horst Mager Culinary Institute before beginning a career in culinary work and hotel management for Holiday Inn in the Portland area. During his tenure with the hotel industry, he met a fellow Parkrose High graduate, Kris, who would become his wife of 42 years. They would go on together to work in the Houston, Texas area before receiving an offer to manage a hotel in The Dalles and so the two moved their new family to The Dalles in 1982. After arriving in The Dalles, Bob began his real estate career as well as his time as an Oregon athletics official for high school football and basketball. His career as a referee in the Mid-Columbia region also included service as basketball and football commissioner and the peer awarded State Football Referee of the Year. Being a family man with a business to operate is a difficult and time consuming role in itself. In addition to being a great father, successful realtor, and a reliable referee for the region's student athletes, Bob found even more time to give to his community in a number of roles including membership and presidency of The DaIles Rotary and Lions Clubs, serving on the Mid-Columbia Fire and Rescue Board, North Wasco County School District Budget Committee, and a term on The Dalles City Council. Bob and Kris also helped establish the long time sister city program with Miyoshi City, Japan that regularly sends citizens abroad and brings citizens of Miyoshi City to The DaIles to better promote understanding and exchange in the global community. Bob's service with The Port of The DaIles began in 2003, where he served as commissioner until 2014 when he was elected President, a position he held until his retirement at the end of June. During his term, he has been an integral part of the economic driver that is The Port of The DaIles. Despite the progressive loss of major job creators over the years, The Port commission has managed to work with the community to create fruitful ideas to bring new jobs into the area. As a member of the Port's Community Outreach Team, I knew I could count on Bob to provide valuable insight in crafting solutions to the issues facing The DaIles and Wasco County. As Bob begins his transition into retirement, I know he and Kris will look forward to more time together. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, please join me in recognizing and thanking my good friend, Bob McFadden for his many years of leadership and service to The Dalles. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1290] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING BOB McFADDEN IN THE DALLES, OREGON ______ HON.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Monday, September 19, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the important work done by Ms. Nicole Clark for hosting the 2016 Breast Friends event at Harmony Middle School in Virginia's Tenth Congressional District. Nicole has worked on hosting these events since [[Page E1291]] 2013, when she first started them with her ``breast friend'' Michelle Batt. The success of these events has helped raise awareness and spread knowledge on the subject of breast cancer. Their hard work exemplifies the caring attitude of Loudoun County's residents. The 2016 Breast Friend event will entail discussion with a panel of doctors who are working in fields related to breast cancer, as well as Ms. Clark's own story about her experience with breast cancer. The overall mission of Ms. Clark and the Breast Friends team is to provide support to a community of women suffering from breast cancer. I believe that it is important to continue working to help defeat breast cancer; while also supporting those organizations and programs such as Breast Friends that do so much for those already suffering from this disease. These events serve a vital role in the continued education of our community about diseases such as breast cancer, and in the creation of support networks for those affected by it. It is my hope that this event will endure into the future and continue this legacy of community support and awareness. I thank and commend everyone involved in the 2016 Breast Friends event. Their caring spirit will result in critically important issues being discussed to a greater degree in our society. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join in recognizing Ms. Nicole Clark of Loudoun County for her work as host of the 2016 Breast Friends event in Hamilton, Virginia. Although Michelle Batt will not be in the country for this year's event, she will continue to be an integral part of the important work done by the Breast Friends in our great Commonwealth. I commend both Nicole and Michelle for their continued dedication to supporting those suffering from breast cancer. I wish them all the best in their future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1290-E1291] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 2016 BREAST FRIENDS EVENT ______ HON.

CREC-2016-09-19-pt1-PgE1291-3,CREC-2016-09-19,114,CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF EL PASO HIGH SCHOOL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1291-E1292] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF EL PASO HIGH SCHOOL ______ HON. BETO O'ROURKE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, September 19, 2016 Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the 100th Anniversary of El Paso High School (EPHS). September 18, 2016 marks the 100th anniversary of El Paso's oldest operating high school, El Paso High. During these 100 years, the ``Lady on the Hill'' has played an influential role in defining the best of our community and country. El Paso High has a long and proud history of service. In the early 1900's El Paso High School's first Texas Cadet Guard became one of the first Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (JROTC) in the United States. She has prepared notable officers like William D. Hawkins, an El Paso High JROTC alumnus and Medal of Honor recipient of the U.S. Marine Corps, after whom the U.S.S. Hawkins was named. In 1925, an airfield on the U.S. Army's installation at Fort Bliss was named after James Buster Biggs, another EPHS graduate who was killed in a plane crash at Beltran, France in 1918. El Paso High School also represents the best of our country's connection with the rest of the hemisphere. Located just three miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, EPHS is 93 percent Hispanic, and has implemented a nationally recognized Dual Language Gifted and Talented Program. Also known as Mundos Unidos, or Connecting Worlds, the unique program was awarded the multi-million dollar Jacob K. Javits Grant from the U.S. Department of Education. The program has helped EPHS graduates to receive top scholarships at the top universities. Innovation and creativity flourish here. F. Murray Abraham, a 1958 graduate, began his acting career at El Paso High School. His talent won him a drama scholarship to the Texas Western College, and later an Academy Award for Best Actor in the film Amadeus. Jim Ward and Cedric Bixler-Zavala, best known for their collaboration in the groundbreaking band At the Drive-In, are both proud Tigers. Another accomplished El Paso High graduate, Tom Lea, moved the nation through his art, writing, and war-time correspondence. Lea brought the Southwestern region to life in his famous murals that can be found in public buildings from Washington, D.C. to Dallas, Texas. Mr. Lea also worked as an eyewitness correspondent for Life Magazine, where he traveled more than 100,000 miles to record the experiences of U.S. and Allied officers in World War II. He wrote and illustrated The Brave Bulls and The Wonderful Country, which were later adapted into Hollywood movies. Ruben Salazar, a pioneer journalist during the 1960's Chicano movement, was the first Mexican-American to cover the Chicano community in mainstream media. His news coverage included police discrimination against Mexican-Americans, Chicano protests, and the relations between Chicanos and African Americans. On August 29, 1970, Salazar covered the Chicano Moratorium anti-war protest in East Los Angeles, the largest Mexican-American rally in U.S. history. Sheriff's deputies and officers wielded clubs and fired tear gas at protestors in the area, hitting and instantly killing Salazar. His unfortunate death and fearless character has made him a civil rights leader for our country. Abraham, Lea, and Salazar are among the many high-skilled, gifted minds El Paso High has produced. Our city's oldest high school has exceptionally prepared some of our nation's best visionaries. The beauty of El Paso High School lies not only within its students, but with its architecture as well. In 1980, El Paso High became an official historic landmark in the National Register of Historic Places. Its unique Greco-Roman architecture was inspired by the Portico of Octavia in Rome, Italy. Henry Trost, the chief architect, designed the school and some of the most unique buildings in the Southwest. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to rise with me to honor El Paso High School and the extraordinary work they have [[Page E1292]] done these last 100 years with our students and community. Viva la High. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 141 (Monday, September 19, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1291-E1292] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF EL PASO HIGH SCHOOL ______ HON.

Mr. Lea also worked as an eyewitness correspondent for Life Magazine, where he traveled more than 100,000 miles to record the experiences of U.S. and Allied officers in World War II. He wrote and illustrated The Brave Bulls and The Wonderful Country, which were later adapted into Hollywood movies.

His news coverage included police discrimination against Mexican-Americans, Chicano protests, and the relations between Chicanos and African Americans. On August 29, 1970, Salazar covered the Chicano Moratorium anti-war protest in East Los Angeles, the largest Mexican-American rally in U.S. history. Sheriff's deputies and officers wielded clubs and fired tear gas at protestors in the area, hitting and instantly killing Salazar. His unfortunate death and fearless character has made him a civil rights leader for our country. Abraham, Lea, and Salazar are among the many high-skilled, gifted minds El Paso High has produced.
